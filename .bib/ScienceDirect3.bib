abstract = {COVID-19 has revealed how challenging it is to manage global, systemic and compounding crises. Like COVID-19, climate change impacts, and maladaptive responses to them, have potential to disrupt societies at multiple scales via networks of trade, finance, mobility and communication, and to impact hardest on the most vulnerable. However, these complex systems can also facilitate resilience if managed effectively. This review aims to distil lessons related to the transboundary management of systemic risks from the COVID-19 experience, to inform climate change policy and resilience building. Evidence from diverse fields is synthesised to illustrate the nature of systemic risks and our evolving understanding of resilience. We describe research methods that aim to capture systemic complexity to inform better management practices and increase resilience to crises. Finally, we recommend specific, practical actions for improving transboundary climate risk management and resilience building. These include mapping the direct, cross-border and cross-sectoral impacts of potential climate extremes, adopting adaptive risk management strategies that embrace heterogenous decision-making and uncertainty, and taking a broader approach to resilience which elevates human wellbeing, including societal and ecological resilience.}

The education sector has benefited from this ICT-driven revolution, which has provided and expanded multiple new tools and teaching methods that did not exist just a few decades ago. In light of this technological change, virtual laboratories (VLs) based on the use of virtual reality (VR) have emerged, which are increasingly used to facilitate the teaching–learning process in a wide range of training activities, both academic and professional types. The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning.}

abstract = {Background
Personal health record (PHR) has been extensively used in developed countries; however, it has been limitedly adopted in developing countries. This study was conducted in Indonesia: a developing country with the largest population in Southeast Asia. PHR that is integrated with health providers is needed to achieve a transformation from a health provider-centered to a patient-centered healthcare system.
Objective
To qualitatively analyze barriers and facilitators of PHR adoption by health facilities in Indonesia from the technological, organizational, environmental, and individual factors.
Methods
In this qualitative study, we used semi-structured interviews with three health facility directors, 17 IT heads, eight physicians, and three nurses from 10 primary healthcare facilities, nine government hospitals, and six private hospitals in Indonesia. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis in NVivo 12. The analysis stages involved familiarizing data, generating initial codes, searching themes, evaluating themes, defining and naming themes, and writing reports.
Results
Regarding technological factors, the barriers to PHR adoption include security and privacy, interoperability, and infrastructure. Organizational support can facilitate PHR adoption in terms of organizational factors, while a lack of human resources is a barrier to PHR adoption. Regarding environmental factors, the lack of government regulations is the barrier to PHR adoption, while competition between health facilities and vendor support could facilitate PHR adoption. Finally, regarding individual factors, perceived usefulness and ease of use can be facilitators of PHR adoption, while user attitudes and e-health literacy can be barriers to PHR adoption.
Conclusions
This study is expected to comprehensively understand PHR adoption in Indonesia and could be applied to other developing countries with similar technological, legal, or cultural characteristics as Indonesia. This study also provides information that can guide health regulators, health facilities, or PHR vendors in planning the implementation of integrated PHR.}

The vast amount of digitised data that is made available to companies can be a new source of value generation. However, the mechanisms through which companies can take advantage of digital technologies to increase performance are not clearly defined. A research model is proposed suggesting that developing a digital organisational culture facilitates both the process of business digitisation and the generation of value from digital tools, with the ultimate goal of improving organisational performance. The research involved 93 production centres of a multinational company with presence in more than 10 countries. The theoretical model was tested by using structural equation modelling. The results show that business digitisation can boost the development of value activities, but companies will only unleash this potential if they incorporate a digital organisational culture. By defining the organisational culture that best supports their digital strategy, firms can expect to improve their performance.}

It's important to differentiate between nursing and organizational models of care, as one has a professional theoretical foundation, the other is about work distribution. Traditional models of care are described and evaluated. The many factors influencing choices regarding the model of care adopted are identified and described. This includes the recognition of professional status, social and working conditions. Nurses make use of a problem based scientific method to assess, plan, implement and evaluate care. Nursing care plans serve as a guide for allocating care activities. The efficacy of nursing resource management at the point of care directly influences the quality of care received by patients as well as staff satisfaction and productivity. Linking electronic care plans and nursing documentation with electronic health/medical records can facilitate data analytics, improve efficiency and the effectiveness of services delivered. This chapter provides detailed instructions regarding the adoption of teamwork, a shift routine example and a method to evaluate the success of small team nursing. It concludes with a discussion of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary teamwork and associated success factors.}

A survey conducted among a sample of 215 Chinese firms indicates that: (1) both external and internal tie strength enhance three dimensions of resilience capacity, namely situation awareness, adaptive capacity and transformative capacity; (2) all three resilience capacity dimensions facilitate reactive crisis management strategy, while only adaptive capacity and transformative capacity have positive effects on proactive crisis management strategy; (3) both reactive and proactive crisis management strategies improve crisis management performance. The study contributes to literature of organizational resilience by probing into the theoretical model of “tie strength-resilience capacity-crisis management strategy-firm performance” which implies that organizational resilience is driven by internal and external tie strength and then facilitates crisis management performance through reactive and proactive strategies. The findings provide managerial implications about successfully coping with crisis, such as global pandemic, by leveraging firm's resilience capabilities facilitated by social relationship and implementing reactive and proactive strategies.}

The results reveal that Leanness facilitates the supplier collaboration on environmental programs and positively contributes to environmental and operational performance. In contrast, it exerts a positive second order effect on economic performance, which should then be pursued as a long term target. A process innovation strategy based on I4.0 technologies improves the effect of Leanness on operational performance, which also leads to higher economic outcomes. Nevertheless, firms can gain higher performance either by collaborating with suppliers on environmental programs or by investing in I4.0 technologies but not with both.}

However, their abilities to participate in the online service system are often undermined by a continuing ‘digital divide’. This divide may be exacerbated by the strategies of service providers who fail to recognise and respond to the needs of older rural clients. This paper is based on a case study in Clare, a small rural town in South Australia, and examines the experiences of older residents and local service providers in trying to engage online for digital service delivery. Drawing on two sets of in-depth interviews, the study uses a mix of thematic content analysis and social network analysis to identify the nature and extent of digital interactions between older people and service providers, and the enablers and challenges for online service engagement. Older participants demonstrated considerable interest in learning how to use the Internet for accessing particular services, with social support networks and third party facilitators being crucial enablers. Service providers’ ambitions to engage with older people online appeared more limited as a result of entrenched stereotypes of older non-users, a lack of internal digital skills, as well as organisational and funding constraints. The case study findings emphasise the importance of balancing the views of older people and service providers in the design of online engagement strategies. These insights are critical for improving online service delivery in rural communities affected by an increasing withdrawal of physical services.}

This paper investigates the impact of COVID 19 on the progress of the SDGs and provides insight into how green recovery stimulus, driven by circular economy (CE)-based solid waste management (SWM) could assist in attaining the intended targets of UN-SDG. It was understood in this review that the guiding principles of the UN-SDGs such as, public health, environmental concerns, resource value and economic development are similar to those that have driven the growth of waste management activities; thus, in order to achieve the goals of UN-SDG, a circular economy approach in solid waste management system should be prioritized in the post-COVID economic agenda. However, policy, technology and public involvement issues may hinder the shift to the CE model; therefore, niche growth might come from developing distinctive waste management-driven green jobs, formalizing informal waste pickers and by focusing in education and training of informal worker. The review also emphasized in creating green jobs by investing in recycling infrastructure which would enable us to address the climate change related concerns which is one of the key target of UN- SDG. The CE-based product designs and business models would emphasize multifunctional goods, extending the lifespan of products and their parts, and intelligent manufacturing to help the public and private sectors maximise product utility (thus reducing waste generation) while providing long-term economic and environmental benefits. The study also recommended strong policies that prioritized investments in decentralization of solid waste systems, localization of supply chains, recycling and green recovery, information sharing, and international collaboration in order to achieve the UN-SDGs.}

The results indicated that employee participation played the most powerful role in improving supplier, customer, and internal resilience. Moreover, employee skills only facilitate internal and customer resilience but have no significant impact on supplier resilience. By contrast, employee incentives do not influence the dimension of SC resilience. It was also found that both internal and customer resilience have positive effects on operational performance, while supplier resilience has no significant effect.

This technology has the potential to improve the reliability and scalability of organizational systems and leads to an enhanced focus on core business and strategy. Despite the Australian Federal Government's ‘cloud-first’ strategy and policies and the Queensland State Government's ‘digital-first’ strategy, the adoption of cloud services at the local government level has been limited, largely due to a lack of specificity among government regulations and a lack of regulations that provide support to local governments. This empirical study deploys a mixed research method designed to develop a cloud regulations model to assist governments in adopting cloud computing services. By integrating Australian Cloud Policy Frameworks with the extant research on cloud computing, this study conducted 21 field interviews with Information Technology (IT) managers and surveyed 480 IT staff from Australia's 47 local governments. This research paper presents and validates a revised set of factors used to develop government regulations specific to cloud computing adoption. The factors that we found to be statistically significant were cost, quality of services, security, privacy, management, government-based facilitating conditions, and firm-based facilitating conditions regulations. Based on these findings, this research concludes that government regulation is a significant aspect in decision making for the adoption of any new technology such as cloud computing.}

As cities expand and populations grow, the demand for land resources intensifies, leading to a misallocation between available land resources and urban development requirements. Therefore, using a panel fixed-effects model, this study explores the impact of land resources misallocation (LRM) on environmental pollution (EP) using 267 prefecture-level city data from 2011 to 2020. Our findings show that LRM significantly increases EP with a time lag effect. LRM increases the number of urban industrial enterprises and thus increases EP. Implementing the broadband China strategy negatively moderates the positive relationship between LRM and EP. There is a threshold effect of LRM on EP, which is more evident in cities with high levels of EP. The promotion effect of LRM on EP will be more evident in southern cities, cities with smaller population sizes and cities with lower digitalization levels. This study clarifies the mechanism between LRM in EP and the active role of broadband China strategy, which has important practical significance for promoting government personnel in optimizing land resource allocation to achieve green development.}

Neighborhood effects also indirectly promote the adoption of clean cooking fuels by rural households through the Internet. There is heterogeneity in the neighborhood effects on the adoption of clean cooking fuels by rural households.

abstract = {The lot sizing problem has attracted the attention of researchers for more than a century, and it still belongs to the most relevant decision problems in many manufacturing companies. During the evolution of research on lot sizing, the seminal economic order quantity (EOQ) model proposed by Harris [1913. How many parts to make at once. Factory, the Magazine of Management, 10 (2), 135-136.] has remained the most popular model, despite its limitations. To support lot sizing decisions in practice, researchers have frequently extended Harris’ basic EOQ model to better reflect the characteristics of real production processes. One of these extensions is the consideration of controllable (variable) production rates, which gives production planners more flexibility in managing the build-up and depletion of inventory and in controlling costs. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of EPQ-type lot sizing models that consider controllable production rates. First, the paper proposes a conceptual framework that captures the characteristics of controllable production rates including the planning horizon (short vs. long term), the number of potential interventions per production run (one vs. multiple), the effect of controllable production rates on the performance of the inventory system (e.g., unit production costs, energy consumption, product quality), and the type of lot sizing model considered (e.g., two-stage models, multi-stage models, multi-item models). Secondly, the paper presents the results of a systematic literature review and evaluates the state-of-research of lot sizing models with controllable production rates.

abstract = {In the current modern era of information and technology, the concept of Building Information Modeling (BIM), has made revolutionary changes in different aspects of engineering design, construction, monitoring, and management of infrastructure assets, especially bridges. In the field of bridge engineering, Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM), as a specific form of BIM, includes digital twinning of bridge assets associated with geometrical information and non-geometrical inspection data. BrIM has demonstrated tremendous potential in substituting traditional paper-based documentation and hand-written reports with digital bridge documentation/transformation, allowing professionals and managers to execute bridge management more efficiently and effectively. However, concerns remain about the quality of the acquired data in BrIM development, as well as lack of research on utilizing these information for remedial actions/decisions in a reliable Bridge Management System (BMS), which are mainly reliant on the knowledge and experience of the involved inspectors, or asset managers, and are susceptible to a certain degree of subjectivity. To address these concerns, this research paper presents a comprehensive methodology as an advanced asset management system that employs BrIM data to improve and facilitate the BMS. This innovative BMS is comprised of a precise Terrestrial Laser Scan (TLS)-derived BrIM as a qualitative digital replica of the existing bridge, incorporating geometrical and non-geometrical information of the bridge elements, and equipped with a requirement-driven framework in a redeveloped condition assessment model for priority ranking of bridge elements based on their health condition. In another step ahead, the proposed BMS integrates a Decision Support System (DSS) to score the feasible remedial strategies and provide more objective decisions for optimal budget allocation and remedial planning. This methodology was further implemented via a developed BrIM-oriented BMS plugin and validated through a real case study on the Werrington Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge in New South Wales, Australia. The finding of this research confirms the reliability of BrIM-oriented BMS implementation and the integration of proposed DSS for priority ranking of bridge elements that require more attention based on their structural importance and material vulnerability, as well as optimizing remedial actions in a practical way while preserving the bridge in a safe and healthy condition.}

However, there is a lack of research on managers' attitudes and intentions to use AI for decision making. To address this gap, we develop an integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) to consider both the positive and negative factors that collectively influence managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. The research model is tested through a large-scale questionnaire survey of 269 UK business managers. Our findings suggest that IAAAM provides a more comprehensive model for explaining and predicting managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. Our research contributes conceptually and empirically to the emerging literature on using AI for organizational decision-making. Further, regarding the practical implications of using AI for organizational decision-making, we highlight the importance of developing favorable facilitating conditions, having an effective mechanism to alleviate managers’ personal concerns, and having a balanced consideration of both the benefits and the dark side associated with using AI.}

One possible application is to support manual quality control at the end of a production line by an automated quality control system based on data driven predictive analysis of the acquired shop floor data. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of such a predictive quality system for a deep drawing manufacturing process of car body parts. As a first step, we formalized the experience and expertise of the domain experts to enable automated a-posteriori quality assessment of the deep drawing process data. As a second step, we trained a combination of two long short-term memory neural networks with the auto-labeled data to predict the occurrence of process failures, i.e. cracks within the manufactured car body part, enabling automated a-priori quality assessment of the deep drawing process. We show that our model correctly predicts the occurrence of more than 94% of the process failures, facilitating the possibility to react to failures pre-emptively before they actually occur. We argue that our approach can be transferred to many other production processes whose quality control can be supported by the acquisition of time series data from the involved production machines.}

The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence–driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration.
Résumé
Alors que la pandémie, toujours en cours, a causé plus de cinq millions de décès, la portée et la rapidité des avancées réalisées au cours de la dernière année en matière de découverte scientifique, de communication des données et sur le plan technologique ont été stupéfiantes. Il ne s’agit pas de savoir « si », mais plutôt « quand » nous devrons faire face à la prochaine pandémie, et son ampleur et sa gravité dépendront de l’efficacité avec laquelle nous exploiterons la technologie et la gestion des données pour créer des écosystèmes flexibles, qui faciliteront la collaboration, permettront d’offrir des soins équitables et favoriseront l’innovation. Le présent article de synthèse vise à cerner les défis émergents dans le domaine des soins de santé mis en lumière durant la pandémie et les innovations qui nous ont permis de nous adapter et de continuer à offrir des soins aux patients. La pandémie a révélé la nécessité de modifier radicalement les paradigmes de soins et l’utilisation des technologies en tenant compte de considérations liées à la fracture numérique et à la littératie en santé pour que les interventions numériques en santé atteignent leur plein potentiel et améliorent les résultats de santé. Nous aborderons les progrès de la télémédecine, la surveillance des patients à distance et les technologies portables émergentes. Malgré les promesses de la santé numérique, nous insistons sur l’importance de saisir ses limites, y compris les défis d’interprétation, l’exactitude des données et les algorithmes axés sur l’intelligence artificielle. Nous résumons les plus récentes recommandations du Groupe de travail sur les soins virtuels pour créer un cadre pancanadien. Finalement, nous proposons un modèle pour la mise en œuvre optimale des innovations en matière de santé numérique, lequel repose sur cinq principes, y compris la gestion des données, la sécurité des données, les biomarqueurs numériques, l’intelligence artificielle utile et l’intégration clinique.}

However, due to their complexity and interdisciplinary context, computational tools based on linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), perform a feasible approach to support data analysis and discussion. This study presents a systematic analysis and discusses the constellation-based techniques’ principles, applications, potentialities, and limitations. An exhaustive investigation was performed to collect relevant information on digital databases, and NLP was applied to extract and process data, such as geographical location, classification of knowledge area, keywords extraction, and sentiment perception. Results indicate an upward trend in developing new studies related to constellation techniques within almost 20 countries mentioned in the publications. An extensive predominance of family constellations in psychology, medicine, and public health (94.17%) and Law and legal systems (97.96%) was observed. Also, it seems the publications are highly focused on problem-solving (74.58%). Nonetheless, it was observed an apparent inconsistency between principles and applications in the various constellation techniques. Moreover, the aspects of reproducibility remain insufficiently explored, as well as the ethical issues from facilitators regarding the coherence on how the constellation technique principles are applied. Furthermore, it is feasible to notice the growth of scientific interest in this approach and its benefits as a sustainable support tool for diagnosing problems and possible solutions, as well as, the implementation of social change processes, increasing the perception of systemic relationships in complex environments. The application of this technique in decision-making processes has the potential to be further exploited. To reach this goal, there is the need to progress integrative studies associated with the development of computational tools providing more objective, valuable, and sustainable results for a systemic analysis.}

This critical review provides an insight into the development and implementation of DSSs, published and emerging, together with assessment of their strengths, limitations and opportunities for future integration. Brownfields DSS applications include: remediation technology selection; and land use planning; and risk assessment. The results of this review lead the authors to identify four opportunities to improve brownfield DSSs: (i) increased use of qualitative socioeconomic criteria, particularly costs and economic variables, (ii) decision-support during the early stages of brownfield redevelopment, (iii) the integration of predictive modelling methods, and (iv) improvements of user interfaces and modern web-based functionalities.}

Using the Saudi Arabia context, this paper investigates teachers’ perspectives regarding the implementation of online education to support 21st century skills in the COVID-19 pandemic era for K-3 elementary school students. A qualitative research methodology was applied in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect data from five K-3 female teachers who implemented online education during the pandemic. Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills.}

The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners.}

Due to the complication of the effects on power consumption of servers and few power models considering the inlet air temperature, this study firstly built an experimental setup to effectively facilitate the factor analysis. It then evaluated the effects of inlet air temperature and CPU utilization on server power consumption. During the experiment, the inlet air temperature was adjusted between 20 °C and 35 °C in 5 °C increments. Simultaneously, the SPECpower_ssj2008 was used to change the workload operations per second from 100% to idle, with a 10% interval. These measurements were also used in the server's various CPU power managements. When the inlet air temperature increases from 20 °C to 35 °C, the highest power increase was 17.60 W for Performance operating mode. Furthermore, in the DAPC and OS operating modes, the server power consumption has a piecewise linear relationship with its CPU temperature, and the function fits well when the CPU temperature is lower than 80 °C. For Performance and Workstation operating modes, the server power consumption is proportional to the temperature difference. The measurement-based correlation method employed by this paper can be used to investigate the power consumption model of other type or configured servers. If so, the adaptability of the model can be improved.}

Innovation is one such benefit that is expected nowadays in outsourcing engagements. The rising importance of innovation has been noticed and acknowledged not only in the Information Systems (IS) literature, but also in other management streams such as innovation and strategy. However, to date, these individual strands of research remain largely isolated from each other. Our theoretical review addresses this gap by consolidating and analyzing research on strategic innovation in the ITO and BPO context. The article set includes 95 papers published between 1998 and 2020 in outlets from the IS and related management fields. We craft a four-phase framework that integrates prior insights about (1) the antecedents of the decision to pursue strategic innovation in outsourcing settings; (2) arrangement options that facilitate strategic innovation in outsourcing relationships; (3) the generation of strategic innovations; and (4) realized strategic innovation outcomes, as assessed in the literature. We find that the research landscape to date is skewed, with many studies focusing on the first two phases. The last two phases remain relatively uncharted. We also discuss how innovation-oriented outsourcing insights compare with established research on cost-oriented outsourcing engagements. Finally, we offer directions for future research.}

abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated the building of resilient supply chains, and supply chain digitalization is gradually being recognized as an enabling means to this end. Nevertheless, scholars generally agree that more empirical studies will need to be conducted on how digitalization can facilitate supply chain resilience at various stages and enhance supply chain performance in a highly uncertain environment. To echo the call, this study develops a theoretical influence mechanism of “supply chain digitalization → supply chain resilience → supply chain performance” based on dynamic capability theory. The proposed relationships are validated using survey data collected from 210 Chinese manufacturing companies. The results help identify the paths digitalization and supply chain resilience can take to improve supply chain performance in a turbulent environment. The different roles of three supply chain resilience capabilities, namely absorptive capability (before the disruption), response capability (during the disruption), and recovery capability (after the disruption), which impact on supply chain performance differently, are highlighted. In addition, it is found that digitalization can bring a differential impact on these three supply chain resilience capabilities through different aspects of resource and structural adjustment measures. The findings also confirm the mediating role of absorptive capability, response capability, and recovery capability between digitalization and supply chain performance. During crisis, supply chain digitalization can increase cost-effectiveness, enhance information and communication efficiency, and promote supply chain resilience to achieve better performance. For theoretical contribution, this study enriches the research on supply chain digitalization and resilience by underpinning the relationships between the two with dynamic capability theory. For practical contribution, the research findings provide insights for enterprises to leverage digitalization to strengthen resilience in supply chain.}

The novelty of this work comes from using a quantitative method to test users’ attitudes, data security, data control, data privacy, compliance, and reliability influence on the cloud computing adoption intention in the context of Saudi Arabian healthcare organizations. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used for model development. About 160 respondents from the relevant health organizations participated. The result shows that the attitude towards using technology, data security, compliance, and reliability of the cloud computing services are important determining factors in the adoption of cloud computing in Saudi healthcare organizations. However, the distinction in the findings regarding Data privacy and Data control in the Saudi healthcare organizational context is a clear manifestation of the fact that there is a need for policy formation for data privacy, data control, and data protection legislation in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, raising awareness regarding the practice of data privacy and data control policies among IT managers is essential. Future study should use a more holistic and industry-specific framework such as the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to find new influencing factors from the domains of technological context, the organizational context, and the environmental context.}

To date, theorizing efforts in this space have focused on appraisal processes and nomological models that are designed to capture the responses to the security threats articulated within fear appeals. Because fear appeals are persuasive messages used to generate a sense of urgency about a specific threat that influences protective information security behaviors, they are an important focus in behavioral security research. However, we suggest that theoretical guidance is needed to facilitate further research in this area. We argue that ultimately, fear appeals are treatments intended to serve as catalysts of behavioral change. Therefore, fear appeals should have rhetorical validity, which is a specialized form of ecological validity in which contextualization has been included to ensure that the language embedded in the stimulus is consistent with the threat environment and the expectations of its audience. The rhetorical validity of a fear appeal should account for its exigence, the audience, and any constraints that shape the presentation and reception of the discourse. Using the illustrative example of a well-known behavioral security theory, protection motivation theory, this study provides a framework for behavioral security scholars in designing fear appeals that have rhetorical validity.}

Systems medicine is based on approaches taken from systems biology, omics research, bio-informatics and network theory. It promises to facilitate a better understanding of the causes of diseases, detection at an earlier stage, and the use of tailor-made approaches to prevention and therapy. This study provides information on how systems medicine could be incorporated into the German healthcare system.
Methods
In a Policy Delphi, consensus and divergence was elicited on whether experts believed systems medicine could be incorporated into the German healthcare system by 2030. Additionally, factors that could influence the implementation process were analysed. 11 theses on potential systems medicine developments and 193 arguments on influencing factors were evaluated. Experts from health and health-related fields were selected using “purposive sampling”.
Results
The experts interviewed expressed their trust in the provision of a legal-political framework, though they remained uncertain as to whether the necessary social discourse on the ethical and cultural questions surrounding systems medicine would occur. They do not (currently) expect systems medicine to be implemented by 2030.
Conclusion
Systems medicine is currently regarded as a visionary concept. As such, it would be premature to attempt to judge the success of the translation process at this stage. The results can help with the identification of the challenges involved in implementation, and the action required to achieve this aim.}

Extended reality (XR) technologies are exploited for immersive visualisation to strengthen the connectivity between human and cyber-physical systems. However, the role and development of XR in the IoT-empowered supply chain scenarios are not revealed. Therefore, this article attempts to introduce readers to the latest XR technologies and summarise significant research opportunities/challenges raised by the current literature to facilitate further interest in this topic. The systematic literature review process analysed 71 research articles from 1,207 relevant publications using text mining models, including the bag of words (BoW) and LexRank algorithms. Consequently, the article synthesises emerging XR solutions for human-cyber-physical interaction to guide the next-generation XR research for logistics and supply chain management.

Hospital discharge is a ‘vulnerable stage’ in care. A delayed, inappropriate or poorly planned discharge increases hazards and costs, inhibiting recovery, and often leading to unplanned readmission. New discharge processes could boost practice, reduce the length of stay, and, consequently, reduce costs and improve patients' quality of life.
Aim
To identify technology based interventions that have been implemented to facilitate a safe and timely discharge procedure after elective surgery, and to describe implementation barriers and facilitators and patient satisfaction.
Method
This rapid review followed a restricted systematic review framework, searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov. for relevant studies published from 2015 to 2021 in English.
Results
Eleven studies were included. Most interventions were machine-learning-based, and only one study reported patient involvement. Effective leadership, team work and communication were stated as implementation facilitators. The main barriers to implementation were: lack of support from leaders, poor clinical documentation, resistance to change, and financial and logistical concerns. None of the studies evaluated patient satisfaction.
Conclusions
Findings highlight factors that support the implementation of technology based interventions aimed at a safe and timely discharge process following elective surgery. Nurses play an important role in the provision of information, and in the development and implementation of discharge processes.}

abstract = {In the manufacturing industry, a hydraulic system harnesses liquid fluid power to create powerful machines. Under the trend of Industry 4.0, the predictive maintenance of hydraulic systems is transforming to more intelligent and automated approaches that leverage the strong power of artificial intelligence and data science technologies. However, due to the knowledge-intensive and heterogeneous nature of the manufacturing domain, the data and information required for predictive maintenance are normally collected from ubiquitous sensing networks. This leads to the gap between massive heterogeneous data/information resources in hydraulic system components and the limited cognitive ability of system users. Moreover, how to capture and structure useful domain knowledge (in a machine-readable way) for solving domain-specific tasks remains an open challenge for the predictive maintenance of hydraulic systems. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a virtual knowledge graph-based approach for the digital modeling and intelligent predictive analytics of hydraulic systems. We evaluate the functionalities and effectiveness of the proposed approach on a predictive maintenance task under real-world industrial contexts. Results show that our proposed approach is capable and feasible to be implemented for digital modeling, data access, data integration, and predictive analytics.}

Therefore, assessing the maturity level of the organization is important for more effective and efficient implementation of CLM. Based on this, the contribution of this research is the development of a CLM maturity model that serves as a guide for the transition to complete horizontal and vertical integration of CLM knowledge and tools across and beyond an organization.

This exploration utilises the bootstrap full- and sub-sample techniques to investigate the connection between the blockchain market and carbon neutrality, which further evidences whether blockchain is a carbon-neutral facilitator or an environmental destroyer. The conclusions present that the blockchain index (BCI) exerts positive and negative influences on the carbon neutral index (CNI), which is following the STIRPAT model. The positive effects suggest that the rapid progress of blockchain technology accelerates the process of carbon neutrality and vice versa, underlining that blockchain is a carbon-neutral facilitator in China. But this view could not be supported by the negative impacts, primarily due to the public health event and national carbon policy helping to raise CNI even during the periods with low BCI. Conversely, CNI has a positive effect on BCI, revealing that achieving carbon neutrality in China requires the support of blockchain technology, which in turn promotes the development of the blockchain market. Under the new round of scientific and technological revolution, practical implications for China can be put forward to achieve carbon neutrality based on the above conclusions.}

abstract = {Context
Enterprise architecture (EA) is a collection of artifacts describing various aspects of an organization from an integrated business and IT perspective. EA practice is an organizational activity that implies using EA artifacts for facilitating decision-making and improving business and IT alignment. EA practice involves numerous participants ranging from C-level executives to project teams and effective engagement between these stakeholders and architects is critically important for success. Moreover, many practical problems with EA practice can be also attributed to insufficient engagement between architects and other EA stakeholders. However, the notion of engagement received only limited attention in the EA literature and the problem of establishing engagement has not been intentionally studied.
Objective
This paper intends to explore in detail the problem of achieving effective engagement between architects and other EA stakeholders in an organization, identify the main inhibitors of engagement and present a theoretical model explaining the problem of establishing engagement in practice.
Method
This paper is based on a single in-depth revelatory case study including nine interviews with different participants of EA practice (e.g. architects and other EA stakeholders) and documentation analysis. It leverages the grounded theory method to construct a conceptual model explaining the problem of engagement in the studied organization.
Results
This paper identifies 28 direct and indirect inhibitors of engagement and unifies them into a holistic conceptual model addressing the problem of achieving engagement that covers the factors undermining both strategic and initiative-based engagement between architects and other EA stakeholders.
Conclusions
This paper focuses on the notion of engagement and offers arguably the first available theoretical model that explains how typical engagement problems between architects and other stakeholders inhibit the realization of value from EA practice. However, the developed model has a number of limitations and we call for further empirical research on engagement problems in EA practice and coping strategies for addressing these problems.}

In order to obtain a reliable prediction, of the operation of a Sustainable Manufacturing System (SMS) and its Social Return (SR), this paper develops a methodology and procedures that allow predicting the system performance as a whole. This will allow us to assist management decision making in industries 4.0, supported by multi-criteria methods in knowledge management, simulation, value analysis and operational research by means of: a) Study the economic, social and environmental impacts in the organization and management of the efficient operation of an SMS with the selection of strategies and alternatives in production chains to minimize and / or mitigate environmental and labor risks. b) Encourage of industrial symbiosis or eco-industries networks that create opportunities increasing eco-efficiency and the positive social return of production systems. This proposed methodology will facilitate changes in the structure of production systems in order to implement industry 4.0 paradigms through facilitator technologies such as simulation and virtual reality. This framework will allow Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and other companies to address the decision-making activities that improve the economic-functional efficiency, which will lead to reduce the environmental impact and increase the positive social return of certain production strategies, considering working conditions. The proposed approach went validated, in the area of the Euroregion Galicia North of Portugal, to favour the implementation of the decision-making through the Industry 4.0 Technologies.}

This paper examines the impact of digital finance on industrial structure upgrading based on panel data from 289 Chinese prefecture-level cities from 2011 to 2020. The paper adopts fixed effects, mediating effects, and spatial econometric models and the findings are as follows. First, digital finance development significantly boosts industrial structure upgrading in Chinese cities. The evidence remains valid after various robustness tests. Second, digital finance and industrial structure upgrading exhibit positive spatial spillover effects. Third, digital finance indirectly affects industrial structure upgrading through innovation, entrepreneurship and the structure of household consumption channels. Fourth, the influence of digital finance is more significant in cities with more developed economies, less financialization and lower income inequality. Finally, among the sub-indicators of digital finance, the breadth of coverage plays the most significant role, inspiring policymakers and financial institutions to speed up the digitization infrastructure in backward areas.}

The advent of digital platforms and dedicated mobile apps, as well as new business models based on the concept of access over ownership and sharing economy (sharing mobility and Mobility as a Service), promises to reshape this sector. It will facilitate and speed up the diffusion of more sustainable and efficient means of transportation based on an intermodal mobility management perspective. The main goal of this paper is to examine the current state of smart mobility together with those factors that may influence the extent of modern sharing mobility proliferation and penetration through ICT applications and social media. The authors applied the content analysis using a sample of more than 1000 citizens' and visitors' reviews published on the official digital platforms of the smart city of Milan. The paper includes a comparison with data drawn from the public urban mobility services users. Based on the nodes resulting from the content analysis, the STEEP method was adopted in order to apply a more complex perspective concerning social, technological, environmental, economic and political issues. This strategic analytical tool was combined with the SWOT analysis dimensions to provide a comprehensive practical contribution to modern municipal smart mobility management systems. The results highlight the need for both smart mobility solutions suppliers and institutions to properly understand and communicate how digital services can be implemented across different users' touchpoints and communication channels to increase the value-added provided to citizens and visitors alike.}

Supply chain quality integration facilitates each company to use its main expertise which can lead to higher quality and cost reductions. Digital audits enhance the possibilities to ensure the production quality at the suppliers. A global supply chain quality integration is illustrated through the case of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner development. The development process was a major challenge for Boeing because not only several innovations were introduced in the 787 plane, but the supply chain quality integration reached new levels for the company. The 787-program had process, management, labor, and demand risks. The first 787 plane was delivered three years later than planned and the budget was exceeded by 10 billion USD. To solve the issues, Boeing created the Production Integration Center. It sent engineers and production workers to its suppliers in several countries of the world to smooth the supply chain quality integration. Boeing supported its suppliers with its knowledge. Onsite cameras were used as digital audits. The Production Integration Center intervened when it estimated delays in the shipments. Boeing successfully solved the issues, but they cost the company a lot. Examining this supply chain restructuring case can help supply chain managers to diagnose and overcome issues in supply chain quality integrations.}

To promote circular economy (CE) applications through resource recovery, this article investigates the feasibility of utilizing LFG as a sustainable energy to power data centers (DCs) in Xiamen (China) and evaluates the implications of waste heat reuse on the energy consumption of DC. The objective of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts and economic benefits of this scheme based on a SFC model. With respect to its novelty, LFG is utilized as an energy supply to DCs, while the waste heat generated in the energy production is recovered. The socio-economic benefits generated in this process are also elaborated. It was found that a large number of MSW was completely recycled to generate energy. The LFG enterprise could benefit from energy sale, while the energy satisfied the annual demand for DC power consumption. Utilizing this energy output resulted in the reduction of primary energy and less CO₂ emissions. By reusing the waste heat for domestic heating, the energy efficiency could be improved, while primary energy could be further saved, avoiding more CO₂ emissions. This implies that utilizing LFG output and waste heat to power DCs not only facilitate resource recovery from unused resources to improve energy efficiency and obtain socio-economic benefits, but also promote the digitalization of DCs and sustainable development of urban cities in the framework of CE.}

Advances in research fields of information technology and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM), machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning, computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1 presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2 introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals. Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4 examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and information integration throughout underground project lifecycle. Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps and future directions.}

Although near-port communities profit from economic benefits, there exist significant concerns regarding exposure to air emissions, which affect human health and climate change. To tackle this issue, a port authority can develop emission reduction plans and projects, whose performance is tracked through an air emissions inventory (EI). Despite the attention on EI methodologies in the past, little research has focused on the implementation of methodologies in information systems. Therefore, a case study is conducted in this paper to investigate the motivation for creating EIs and the obstacles in the EI-creation process from an information systems perspective. The results indicate that data confidentiality and weak information systems are major obstacles, which hinder the creation of high-quality EIs and generate additional costs. Our findings enable port stakeholders and decision makers to understand the current obstacles and facilitate the development of adequate information systems that support the creation of high-quality EIs.}

Hence, this research develops a model by integrating the UTAUT2 constructs and big five personality traits to understand the social sustainability of the Metaverse. The model is tested by employing a hybrid covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) approach based on collecting data from 446 Metaverse users. The CB-SEM results showed that performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness significantly impact the social sustainability of the Metaverse, while no significant effect is reported regarding effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, conscientiousness, and extraversion. All these factors explained 80% of the variance in social sustainability. The ANN results showed that habit is the most important factor in predicting social sustainability. Drawing on these findings, the study offers several theoretical contributions and sheds light on several practical implications for developers, designers, and decision-makers promoting the use of the Metaverse.}

Living laboratories are a popular smart city intervention that have the potential to address this power imbalance and empower citizens to influence smart city development. This research theoretically and empirically explores this role of living labs through a multiple-case study of urban living labs in the region of Catalonia. The findings uncover a ‘power banking’ mechanism which, coupled with other critical factors, facilitates the effectiveness of such initiatives. The considerable efforts required to engage citizens at a fairly basic level suggest that incorporating citizens into smart city models is more challenging than simplistic Quadruple Helix discourses convey.}

The analysis suggests that when common resources are at stake, ad hoc organizational solutions are needed at the field level, in addition to the traditional facilitating action at the project/group level, for SD modeling to succeed. Then, to address the fragilities of the existing approaches to participatory SD modeling, this study integrates concepts and solutions from institutional theories, adaptive co-management, and the body of knowledge on the (new) commons. A second causal loop diagram is provided to show how this new proposed approach could restructure the processes that link SD modeling inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts due to a higher-level permanent organizational unit with specific roles and data management capabilities labeled “smart commons organization”.

The rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and machine learning (ML) technologies hold promise for personalized, equitable cancer care and improved health outcomes within the context of cancer and beyond. Furthermore, integrating these technologies into cancer research has been effective in addressing many of the challenges for cancer control and cure. This can be achieved through the insights generated from massive amounts of data, in ways that can help inform decisions, interventions, and precision cancer care. AI, big data, and ML technologies offer, either in isolation or in combination, unconventional pathways that facilitate the better understanding and management of cancer and its impact on the person. The value of AI, big data, and ML technologies has been acknowledged and integrated within the Cancer Moonshot program in the U.S. and the EU Beating Cancer Plan in Europe.
Data Sources
Relevant studies on the topic have formed the basis for this article.
Conclusion
In a shifting health care environment where cancer care is becoming more complex and demanding, big data and AI technologies can act as a vehicle to facilitating the care continuum. An increasing body of literature demonstrates their impactful contributions in areas such as treatment and diagnosis. These technologies, however, create additional requirements from health care professionals in terms of capacity and preparedness to integrate them effectively and efficiently in clinical practice. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investment and training in oncology to combat and overcome some of the challenges posed by cancer control.
Implications for Nursing Practice
AI, big data, and ML are increasingly integrated in various aspects of health care. As a result, health care professionals, including nurses, will need to adjust in an ever-changing practice environment where these technologies have potential applications in clinical settings to improve risk stratification, early detection, and surveillance management of cancer patients.}

With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public–private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public–private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.}

On the other hand, network security professionals have new technologies and tools at their disposal. This paper focuses on a few of these technologies and investigates new ways to take advantage of them. To this end, we present Citadel, a novel security system utilizing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to construct automated defense solutions in software-defined networking (SDN) environments. Citadel also incorporates network function virtualization (NFV) and service function chaining (SFC) to achieve flexible, cost-efficient, and proactive network defense. We examine CTI data to extract common attacker models and design security services as virtual network functions chained together using SFC to counter these threats. The modular and extensible nature of Citadel makes it suitable for incremental deployment in networks. Besides, we propose a new CTI data model to use as an extension of the existing CTI models for better compatibility with automated network defense. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposals are applicable and effectively facilitate the management of agile defense in SDN/NFV-enabled networks.}

In this chapter, it has been assumed that the implementation of smart city governance is possible thanks to the adoption of appropriate development policies (to increase public participation, improve access to information-communication technologies and the open data policy), which are conducive to the development of platforms intended for stimulating bottom-up participatory. Attention is paid mainly to platforms that serve the phenomena called coproduction (including geoparticipation, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, hackathons, Living Labs, gamification) and cocreation of value (e.g., urban hacktivism and BarCamps).}

Subsequently, the weight of finalized impacts and the performance score of finalized IDTs have simultaneously been measured via a novel version of Pythagorean fuzzy SECA (Simultaneously Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives). Then, the priority of each intervention for disruptive impacts of Industry 4.0 has been determined via the Hanlon method. This is one of the first papers to provide in-depth insights into advancing the study of the disruptive action of Industry 4.0 technologies cross-fertilizing CE throughout pharmaceutical SCs in the emerging economy of Iran. The results indicate that digital technologies such as Big Data Analytics, Global Positioning Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, and Digital Platforms are quite available in the Irans' pharmaceutical industry.

abstract = {In the quest to achieve sustainable development goals, developments in sustainability-oriented chemical process design are key to innovation in the chemical industry, especially important for processes aiming for sustainable fuels. One of the greatest challenges is the difficulty of modeling the highly complex interactions among the design variables, such as catalyst technology attributes, and greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the computational aids crucial to deal with the complexity of chemical processes require data that is either unavailable or uncertain at an early stage of design. The multistage integrated system for sustainable design proposed in this paper boosts these computational aids by applying data science techniques to allow uncertainty to be handled more efficiently, thereby facilitating the modeling of the interactions between the properties of new materials or processes and sustainability indicators. In this system, current data connectivity methods are used to find paths of correlation among catalysts properties and greenhouse gas emissions. The key feature of the proposed system relies on the integration through multiple stages of Fuzzy Inference systems and a data-driven technique for Emissions Analytics, FIEMA.11FIEMA: Fuzzy Inference and Emission Analytics. The algorithm in FIEMA provides a semi-supervised learning approach to emission analytics: it determines data clusters by a C-means algorithm and subsequently builds fuzzy sets for multiple stages of input–output inference. The proposed FIEMA system was demonstrated in an effort to determine the optimal configurations of the properties of catalysts to minimize the probability of associated greenhouse gas emissions for a methanol production process. The results showed the potential of this approach to reduce the search space of catalyst material designs by suggesting promising configurations for oxygen storage capacity, mechanical strength, lifetime, size, and poisoning level. The research impacts of this study contribute to the development of clean fuels by a computationally-efficient system for early design, and by the determination of catalysts development paths that assure an actual reduction of the life-cycle emissions.}

Previous research shows that older adults, people with a lower education level, people with impairments and people with a migration background are more likely to be negatively impacted by digitalisation in transport services. In order to uncover mechanisms behind digital inequality in public transport, we interviewed 39 people belonging to these groups. They experience difficulties due to low digital skills, not using digital technologies on-the-go, not possessing the right devices and due to a complex design of technologies, among others. Many participants reap some benefits of digitalisation though. In fact, individuals can experience benefits on one aspect and difficulties on another. Nevertheless, experiencing difficulties with digitalisation does not necessarily equal to exclusion from public transport thanks to coping strategies like support from one's social network. Still, many coping strategies come with pitfalls such as hidden work and costs. Digital technologies facilitate a self-service approach that paradoxically makes some people more dependent on others. This study can support practitioners and researchers in developing a better understanding of the (sometimes insidious) consequences of technological innovations on individuals.}

By studying six leading manufacturing firms based on 86 manager interviews, the present study finds that strategic capabilities are renewed through dynamic capabilities, which involve a reconfiguration of strategic capabilities and processes. Furthermore, manufacturers need to consider the dynamic interplay between resource realignment modes (building digital capabilities, leveraging existing capabilities, accessing external capabilities, and releasing decaying capabilities), hence stressing their reinforcing mechanism to converge products, services, and software. For managers, our study highlights several strategic renewal practices designed to assist and benchmark how strategic capabilities are altered.}

They have the same purpose of measuring how the current state of an organization unit is capable of adopting and implementing the concept of industry 4.0 in the future. Many researchers had proposed maturity models for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and maturity since 2011 when Industry 4.0 was commenced. However, there has been no attempt to analyze empirical evidence systematically. This paper aims to analyze currently available maturity models related to Industry 4.0 and provide a synthesis on those maturity models. This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies implemented on the maturity model published in several reputable and relevant sources. It focuses on the manufacturing and logistics sectors since the processes in both sectors can be highly improved through the introduction of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and artificial intelligence. In general, the primary purpose of the review is to address the following questions: (1) Based on what dimensions do researchers develop Industry 4.0 maturity models, and what are the most used and influencing parameters in those dimensions? (2) How do those maturity models compare to each other in terms of dimension complexity, techniques, maturity leveling, and kind of application sectors of the model? In conclusion, the maturity model in the context of Industry 4.0 is promising to guide the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies at the organization level. However, just having a maturity model is not enough. More efforts are needed to facilitate the application of it.}

abstract = {Background
In response to increasing emergency department presentations and wait times in Australia, multiple strategies and models of care have been implemented with varying results. One effective strategy has been the implementation of pre-hospital blood collection by paramedics when they insert an intravenous cannula. This research aims to determine the efficiency of and barriers to wider implementation of a pre-hospital blood collection trial in a regional context. In particular, to evaluate the impact of the pre-hospital blood collection on time to pathology results and error rates, and paramedic opinion.
Methods
This retrospective controlled cohort study was conducted over 12 months from August 2018. Emergency and pathology data were used to determine the haemolysis and error rates, as well as the time to result availability of pre-hospital blood collection samples compared to in hospital samples arrived by ambulance. To determine the facilitators and barriers to wider implementation a survey of 48 paramedics was conducted following completion of the 12-month trial. The survey was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, a behavior change theory associated with improved uptake when applied.
Findings
Overall 237 samples were collected. There was a 65% (51min) reduction in time taken for samples to be received at pathology and a 38% (50min) improvement in time taken for results to return from pathology for patients arrived by ambulance. There were no labelling errors in the pre-hospital blood collection group or change in haemolysis rates. The majority (79%) of paramedics who completed the survey were optimistic about the protocol improving patient outcomes and 89% regarded the change in practice as acceptable. Three main themes emerged: 1. Training, environmental challenges and adequate equipment; 2. increased efficiency and improved patient care and 3. Prerequisites to implementing a new practice. Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative data resulted in 10 key influencers of behavior that need to be addressed in any future implementation.
Conclusion and implications for practice
The introduction of pre-hospital phlebotomy reduced the time to blood results availability by 38% and resulted in fewer labelling errors. Wider implementation is supported by paramedics, but more training is required.}

The real benefit of this digitalisation lies in the adoption of model-based definition across all stages of the product lifecycles throughout the enterprise and its supply chain which is termed as model-based enterprise (MBE). However, the current application of this technology is partial, due to the involvement of several associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel framework for the management of uncertainties in the adoption of the model-based definition and presents a system in support of the proposed framework. The development commenced with the collaboration of two major aerospace industries. The framework comprises five phases including the preliminary phase, identification, assessment, analysis, and response phase. A systematic process is followed in developing the framework while Numeral, Spread, Assessment, and Pedigree (NUSAP), and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are used in the assessment of uncertainties. The developed system consists of a user interface, a database of uncertainties, an assessment module, an analysis and prioritisation module, and a knowledge base of mitigation strategies for key uncertainties. The system facilitates the analyst to select the relevant uncertainties from a defined list, systematically assess and analyse each of the uncertainty and obtain recommendations for mitigation of the prioritised uncertainties in the project. The framework and the developed system were validated through expert interviews with two world-class aerospace companies. This system facilitates identifying the various types of uncertainties of MBD, quantifying their impact on the project rationally, and formulating a suitable management strategy for achieving the status of a model-based enterprise.}

The model emphasizes the critical role of human capital as embodied in employees and their ever-shifting interaction with organizational culture to ensure the success of AI implementation. Since relationships remain the salient connections that bind organizations on value delivery, humans are and will remain critical to value-added activities and processes – even when those involve AI – underscoring the effect of the human interface on both economic and relational value for customers.}

abstract = {The exponential growth of renewable electricity generation has transformed significantly the operating environment of gas turbines. Nowadays, gas turbines operate under transient conditions to support their renewable partners. Gas turbine dynamic performance simulation provides the means for assessing the engine behavior and designing engine controllers that will enable them to fulfill their new operating role. This paper presents a novel gas turbine performance system for representing the nonlinear behavior of a two-shaft gas turbine engine. The developed gas turbine engine model in MATLAB/Simulink environment is capable of simulating both steady state and transient operating conditions, and to facilitate the design of controllers for stable engine operation. Validation of the developed engine model with a gas turbine simulation package confirmed the excellent agreement among all the simulated measurements at transient conditions. The simulated behavior of a hybrid gas/wind power plant enabled the development of an optimized controller for empowering the gas turbine to support the intermittent wind turbines. The time responses of the main parameters of the hybrid gas/wind power plant demonstrated the significant amount of transient conditions that a gas turbine experiences for fulfilling the energy gap imposed by the wind turbines. Finally, the performance comparison of the hybrid power plant to a twin gas turbine power plant highlighted the effective reduction in NOx emissions.}

To synthesise the evidence on the roles and outcomes of change agents in facilitating the use of powered technology systems and devices for staff end-users in residential aged care workplaces.
Design
Systematic review and narrative synthesis.
Data sources
CINAHL, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published in English between January 2010 and July 2022.
Review methods
Two of three reviewers independently screened each title and abstract, and subsequently the full texts of selected records. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the included articles.
Results
Of 3,680 records identified, ten articles reporting nine studies were included. In all the studies, the change agent role was a minor component embedded within implementation processes. Three key change agent roles were identified: 1) providing guidance, expertise, and support with implementing a new technology; 2) delivering training to others, and 3) troubleshooting and responding to issues. The key outcome of change agent roles related to achieving project implementation milestones and higher levels of implementation of technology. Change agent processes, however, were compromised when the designated change agent role was included late in the implementation process, or was not supported, recognised, embraced, or when roles or responsibilities were unclear. The direct contribution of change agents was difficult to elucidate because the roles and outcomes of change agents were embedded in multi-faceted implementation strategies.
Conclusions
The change agent can play an important role in facilitating technology implementation by providing support, training, and troubleshooting. Challenges with the change agent role included unclear role expectations and appointment late in the implementation process. Overall, there was limited evidence specific to the role and outcome of the change agent role to inform ideal approaches for their role in technology facilitation for end-users in residential aged care workplaces.}

Based on the exploratory case studies of 5 Finnish high-tech SMEs, we find that the case SMEs enacted different processes and utilized resources and capabilities creatively to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and leverage it as an opportunity. Findings indicate that agile adaptation and new opportunity utilization were the primary means of dealing with the disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic brought about. These findings indicate effective utilization of sensing and seizing capabilities and engagement with opportunity recognition and discovery to capture opportunities and deal with the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. The results further suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 triggered a fight-or-flight survival instinct among B2B SMEs due to unprecedented levels of market uncertainty. As such, the sensing capability of B2B SMEs allowed them to identify the market threats and opportunities and understand the prevailing market situation. Accordingly, B2B SMEs seized the identified threats and opportunities by reconfiguring their business models and face-to-face and online operations. The digital technologies facilitated the online presence and promoted communication with existing and new customers. Interesting implications emerge from these findings.}

Open innovation (OI) is among the key strategic resources of enterprises, especially in high-tech sectors such as the ICT industry. The use of OI platforms and/or networks that facilitate access to and sharing of OI knowledge is gaining increasing interest. This study aimed to assess the factors motivating and hindering the use of OI platforms and/or networks in the ICT industry in Poland. The uniqueness of this approach lies in the use of a PROFIT analysis to develop proprietary models of the importance of the various motivating factors and barriers to the use of OI platforms and/or networks in the ICT industry in relation to the job position held. This study hypothesized that the knowledge of factors motivating and hindering the use of OI platforms and/or networks in the ICT industry varies across occupational groups. In order to verify the hypothesis and answer the formulated research questions, a diagnostic survey method with a survey technique was used. The results of this study confirm that the job position occupied by employees in the ICT industry is relevant to each of the factors that pose obstacles to their use of OI platforms and/or networks. Managers and management, as well as developers, are less likely to restrict the use of the aforementioned solutions due to organizational and/or administrative barriers, while more likely due to reluctance to share knowledge. For specialists and analysts, legal barriers and NIH syndrome are greater obstacles. For programmers, negative attitudes toward open innovation and lack of internal commitment to the company are less of an obstacle. Insufficient support from top management is a major barrier for administrative staff and programmers. The conclusions formulated can be useful in practice for managers in the ICT industry to make optimal use of access to OI.}

As a result, the systems design time and manufacturing costs are substantially reduced, while their performance, safety and fatigue life are expanded. This work presents a multiobjective optimization framework for developing an optimal design of a front double wishbone vehicle suspension system based on a four-bar mechanism. This is carried out by coupling several computer-aided design tools (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software. The 3D CAD model of the lower control arm of the suspension system is made using SolidWorks®, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the suspension assembly is modelled using ANSYS® Workbench, while the multibody kinetic and dynamic of the designed suspension system is analysed using MSC ADAMS®. They are embedded in a multidisciplinary optimization design framework (modeFrontier®) with the aim of determining the optimal hardpoint locations of a lower control arm by minimizing the chassis pitch accelerations to improve the passengers’ comfort, reducing the volume and mass of the suspension system to increase the vehicle stability and manoeuvrability, while decreasing the maximum stresses to extend the system fatigue life and enhancing safety. The methodology has been successfully applied to several driving scenarios entailing different vehicle dynamics manoeuvres with the aim to find the Pareto optimal front, and to analyse the suspension assembly performance together with the vehicle dynamic behaviour. Results show that the use of such approach may significantly improve the design of the suspension system. Furthermore, a comparison of different optimization strategies and algorithms is performed.}

This integration requires breaking the ”silos” of the circular chain to establish new collaborative and sustainable value networks. The paper introduces a novel digital platform for the CE, which is currently under development in the H2020 DigiPrime project. The platform is destined to facilitate seamless and trusted information exchange across circular actors, while offering a range of value-added services that enable manufacturers, remanufactures, recyclers and other actors to gain insights in the status of recycling and waste management processes. The latter facilitates the implementation of zero waste processes, along with the assessment of the performance of the circular chain. The paper introduces the architecture of the digital platform, along with its data modelling, exchange and data traceability mechanisms. It also presents a CE use case used to validate the platform.}

In this paper, a systemic framework is proposed to provide guidelines for rapid system configuration and easy runtime of DT-based CPPS by integrating CPS, DT modeling technologies, event-driven distributed cooperation mechanisms, and web technologies. The concept of CPS node (CPSN) for manufacturing resources is established by integrating semantic information model, 3D geometric model and function modules. Various CPSNs are orchestrated as an autonomous CPPS using dynamic resource registration and binding technologies. To achieve easy runtime of DT-based CPPS, event-driven distributed cooperation among CPSNs and web-based remote control of CPPS are proposed respectively. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the proposed framework, a prototype of DT-based CPPS is implemented, based on which an exemplary case is conducted.}

To promote data sharing, this study intends to understand the strategies of both platform enterprises and participants based on a dynamic game model to provide policy implications to platform enterprises and the government. The main findings are as follows. First, when platform enterprises move first, they should subsidize key participants with high privacy costs to compensate for the negative externality of data. Second, in the early stages of building a platform, when supporting platform enterprises move first, they must subsidize both key participants with low privacy costs and general participants.

Furthermore, the study investigated contingencies that may modify the relationship between leadership communication and followers’ outcomes. Results from an online panel of 417 U.S. employees showed that top leaders’ use of charismatic rhetoric during change led to followers’ affective commitment to change, which decreased their turnover intention. Furthermore, employees’ organizational identification moderated this relationship. When employees have low identification with their organizations, top leaders’ charismatic rhetoric to address the immediate change is more needed.}

Firm performance plays a mediating role in the relationship between capabilities and CSR differentiation strategy. Our study also enriches the CSR literature by viewing CSR as firms' achieved targets or voluntary activities instead of as an instrument to boost firm performance. This research provides the background for internationalization researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to face obstacles and overcome barriers, enhance digital and creative capabilities, engage in digital platforms, and benefit from international marketing, international retailing, and CSR activities.}

abstract = {With the emerging trend of digital servitization, manufacturers have transformed toward developing and providing smart product-service system (smart PSS) which is considered with great potential. As a value co-creation strategy, the innovative design of smart PSS involves multiple stakeholders, and the decisions in the concept design stage are especially crucial for its success throughout the whole lifespan. However, recent studies have focused on developing the design methodology or decision approaches for it, with an absence of the systematic decision framework for smart PSS innovation design. Most of them held the customer-centric viewpoint without considering the aspect of multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation. To fill the gaps, this study proposes the UNISON framework of model-based innovation for smart PSS design from the perspective of collaborative innovation, to assist its innovative design and decision-making in the concept design stage. To illustrate the structured procedures and demonstrate the validity of this framework, it was applied in an empirical study for the innovative design of smart drainage equipment-service system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed framework has been discussed from both theoretical and practical aspects. This study can provide systematic guidance for developing smart PSS innovative design strategies to facilitate multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation.}
