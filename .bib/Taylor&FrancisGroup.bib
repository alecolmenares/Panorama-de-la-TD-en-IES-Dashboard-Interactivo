This research presents the Digital Activity Plan (DAP) introduced by the Norwegian welfare and labour administration (Nav) in 2017 as a case to investigate how governmental digital platforms impact social work practices. DAP has several intentions for developing digital client communication and managing casework for counsellors, as well as governing and implementing social policies. This article aims to investigate the socio-technical affordances of the digital platform and how it affects the role of the counsellors in Nav. The article defines five affordances of DAP: client communication, information systems, citizen-state contract, measuring, and political instruments. It discusses these affordances from both the counsellor’s experiences and in light of contemporary social politics and research. The results from this case show the impact of digital platforms on social work, how multifaceted socio-technical assemblages emerge, and how complex negotiations of platform affordances take place.},

Emergencies highlight the importance of technical progress and the opportunity to enhance design and productivity. Significant technological and organisational barriers hinder acceptance of these technologies; hence it is necessary to employ strategy. Research should be at the system’s heart through planned and unplanned transitions. The vision of building and maintaining business resilience and organising swift changes includes using perceptual methods. With this view, leaders can make deliberate decisions. It also tends to disrupt traditional approaches to dexterity. At the same time, strategic flexibility necessitates an evident connection between the business and the institution’s mission. A leader’s positive strategic intent is core that better enables investment in crisis response competencies. It includes timely use of knowledge management, organisational learning frameworks, business strategy, and system agility. Many nations in the developing world have simultaneously experienced the rise of digitisation and the spread of the covid-19 epidemic. Thus, academics should focus on the difficulties and prospects associated with people, groups, and management.},

However, there has been limited empirical literature to account for mobile phone use in rural areas for development and lifelong learning. This study employed the data which were collected from 66 phone users in rural areas to report on their technological literacy in the use of mobile phones. The data were generated through questionnaires, focus group discussions and practical tests. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were employed to analyse the data. The analysis revealed that the majority of adults in rural communities could use mobile phones through voice calls and short messages only. Only a few of them could use mobile phones to access internet services. Financial transactions and searching for information on weather, health, politics and businesses were challenging to them. This led to the conclusion that rural communities need to be empowered to access internet services through mobile phones to enhance their socio-economic development activities. It is recommended that technological literacy programmes on the use of mobile phones and the internet to maximise productivity be implemented in rural communities that are mostly farmers and producers of raw materials.},

The purpose of this study is to determine the perceptions of TVET instructors regarding the use of AR technology for skill training in TVET institutions. This case study was conducted using a questionnaire with a 0.99 alpha-Cronbach value. The questionnaire is using 5 Likert-scale and open-ended questions as an instrument for this study. There were 37 respondents selected randomly from TVET institutions in the center region of Malaysia. The findings show that TVET instructors have a positive perception toward using AR in skill training delivery. Furthermore, this study also found there is a challenge to implement AR technology in certain aspects such as students’ acceptance, instructors’ expertise, technology barrier, and policy for TVET institutions. The implication of this study will contribute to the TVET area for training using AR.},

To study Big Data technology, a questionnaire was used where respondents rated: cloud technology; apps; Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and digital learning platforms. The study suggested that the education sector is ambitiously applying Big Data technology, both online and offline. All surveyed respondents use apps in Big Data learning and analysis: 73.03% use Moodle, 67.13% use Zoom, 65.17% use Quizlet, 50.84% use Skype, and 35.11% use Slack. MOOCs in education are used by 75% of respondents. Digital learning platforms are used by all respondents. All students use cloud technology. When dealing with Big Data technologies, students preferred apps (8.9 ± 1.33) instead of the cloud (6.9 ± 0.11). Students believe that the important factors for using Big Data in the learning process include: quality of information (85.96%); interest (77.81%); instructor’s support (66.85%). The research findings make it possible to integrate Big Data technology into the learning process, thus improving learning outcomes and providing greater speed in processing reliable and meaningful data.},

To achieve this, there is a need for construction organizations to partner with other organizations with complementary digital capabilities. This study, therefore, makes a case for digital partnering in the South African construction industry through a survey of construction professionals actively involved in a construction project in the country. Analysis of data gathered was done using a 5-step analysis approach and relevant descriptive and inferential statistics were adopted. Findings revealed that digital partnering is not being adopted among construction organizations in the country. However, if adopted correctly, construction organizations can have a better competitive advantage, improved project performance, and risk reduction through shared digital resources. Furthermore, the barriers to the proper adoption of digital partnering are the poor definition of partnering goal, getting the right digital partner, trust issue, partnering risk issue and investment cost. The study contributes to the body of knowledge as is reveals that construction organizations, particularly in a developing country like South Africa, stands a better chance of surviving the dynamic construction and digital environment by partnering with other organizations within and outside the industry rather than embarking on the digitalization journey alone.},

The study employed a post-positivism philosophical stance which informed the use of a quantitative survey approach. The survey was conducted among construction professionals actively involved in construction projects across the country. Analysis of the data gathered was done using mean item score, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). EFA revealed two principal external environment factors (legislation and regulation, and pressure from clients and competitors) that can influence construction digitalization. Further to this, SEM revealed that while the pressure from client and competitors will have a more significant influence on digitalization, the pressure from industry regulations and government legislation cannot be overlooked. The findings of the study can be used as a guide toward the digitalization of construction organizations through the consciousness of the influence of external environmental issues, an aspect that has not gained significant recognition in the construction digitalization discourse.},

The study adopted a quantitative design using a questionnaire survey. Due to the quantitative nature of the data gathered, statistical methods such as percentage, Mean item score, Mann-Whitney U-Test, and Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling were employed. Findings revealed that construction organizations need to possess transformation capabilities relating to technology governance, knowledge management and the creation of new resources and processes to gain a better competitive advantage and transform their service delivery. Adequate attention should also be given to the five sensing, and seven seizing capabilities identified in the study as they can significantly impact the transformation capabilities of construction organizations.

Results of Experiment 1 elucidated that individuals feel more psychologically distant when they interact with AI recommendation agents than with human agents as a result of a different level of perceived similarity. Furthermore, psychological distance plays a mediating role in determining the effectiveness of desirability- vs. feasibility-focused messages in health-related issues. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the AI speaker's level of perceived similarity via anthropomorphism and found that the AI's recommendation with secondary (vs. primary) features is more effective when AI is humanized, and the reverse was found in non-humanized AI conditions.

To achieve satisfactory outcomes with BIM, adopters need to find the most appropriate implementation strategy that is economically efficient. The research discussed here explores why and how distribution of effort spent on various tasks over project life cycle can be used as a metric for assessing and improving the performance of BIM implementation. Using quantitative data collected from a single in-depth case study of a BIM-enabled design and build project and subsequent interviews with three project actors and 11 BIM experts, to validate and triangulate the findings, we explore the use of effort data to analyze and visualize effort distribution patterns. The visualizations revealed the dynamics of team collaboration and task interdependences in BIM-enabled work and their impact on effort distribution. Lack of timely input by the contractor, subcontractors and suppliers influenced unusual patterns in the distribution of efforts indicating potential sources of inefficiency and unnecessary costs in the BIM process; thereby revealing the pivotal role of procurement structure and suggesting the need for timely involvement of key project participants. The contribution of this work is twofold. Methodologically, effort distribution analytics can provide insights that managers can use to improve BIM implementation process. Theoretically, the findings can be used to support informed decision-making, control cost, optimize resources, manage cash flow and to structure fees.},

This study utilizes metadata from 694 publications generated through a literature survey on SCOPUS to undertake science mapping, thematic structure analysis, and text analytics to identify, evaluate, and initiate a knowledge base of COVID-19 survival techniques and post-pandemic sustainable growth strategies. The results highlight several streams of strategies. First, the firm’s internal resources and situational leadership abilities, including crisis management techniques and dynamic capabilities, provide the initial resilience against the pandemic challenges, supported by government funding and public policy. Second, adopting digital technologies, modifying business models, and process innovation not only aids survival but enhances internal operations. SMEs can turn challenges into opportunities through product innovation, achieving competitiveness and improved performance. Third, securing funding for SMEs’ digitization or digital transformation can be challenging but offers enormous survival opportunities during crises and sustainable growth in the post-pandemic era. SMEs can explore non-traditional financing options, including crowdsourcing and digital financing. Fourth, readily available virtual technologies (virtual meeting platforms) provide immediate relief to businesses and become a significant part of future business practices in the post-pandemic era. Finally, social entrepreneurship blossomed during COVID-19, ignited particularly by the community lockdown, travel restrictions, self-isolations, and quarantine of entrepreneurs and workers. Although scientists cannot stop the outbreak of pandemics, adequate preparation and understanding of effective strategic responses can cushion negative impacts. Further studies can contribute more survival and sustainable growth strategies against potential crises.},

   abstract = {Smart cities achieved digital transformation of patients’ health records through the use of new technology in IoT healthcare industry. Such technologies of using IoT and remote patient monitoring systems have become dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients, and hence reducing the risk of spreading Covid-19 infection. The Ministry of Health in the Kingdom of Bahrain strives to achieve digital transformation in the healthcare industry, where the National Health Information System (I-SEHA) was launched to provide higher-quality health services. The system interconnects the public healthcare institutes, allowing access to patient’s data from any location without the hassle of moving the files physically. Digitization of medical data of patients and sharing some of the data with other institutions outside the protected networks may lead to major privacy and integrity concerns. This paper introduces Blockchain-based Zero-Knowledge Proof (BZKP) model, which is an IoT-based patient-centric model that fuses a zero-knowledge proof solution to be developed for protecting patient’s privacy, and ensures patients prior consent on any access to their data including their health status and account balance. The proposed model is developed to provide a robust and scalable architecture for data sharing, which protects the privacy of sensitive data while maintaining high availability. It also provides strong trust and integrity of data by using the immutability features of the blockchain. BZKP is based on pre-approved blockchain access tokens to address challenges of accountability and privacy in Bahrain smart cities. As a result, the model provides a secure and trusted access model between different stakeholders to share patient data while maintaining privacy, trust, and high availability. The zero-knowledge proof can be used with the smart contracts, which provides programmable actions that can be used for automating the prescriptions dispensation process for private pharmacies in a decentralized manner with high confidence. Finally, it recommends enhanced electronic key (eKey) procedures used by eGovernment of the Kingdom of Bahrain to update the smart card which stores the personal keys for protecting patient’s privacy and provide better consent.},

Therefore, the study conceptually draws the concept of green cybersecurity by applying the theory of reasoned action (TRA) assumptions that logically support green information technology acceptance. Using a convenient sampling, the data were collected from Qatar transport industries, particularly the IT experts and managers, to get responses on the implementation of green cybersecurity and sustainability of 5 transport companies in Doha, Qatar. Using Smart PLS-SEM, the study employed the SEM technique to test the proposed hypotheses. The results reported that green cybersecurity’s control/position, integrity, and authenticity significantly and positively influenced TBL sustainability, but confidentiality, availability, and utility do not. The implementation of industry 4.0 makes them accessible and more effective to ensure TBL sustainable development in the transport industries in Qatar. Applying green cybersecurity in this setting will improve services in transportation sector. A green cybersecurity platform will make it a point to systematically search for and promote innovations made possible by smart green technologies to avoid carbon-emission vehicles. Through the efficient and cutting-edge green, cybersecurity will be Qatar’s transportation sector’s primary responsibility to contribute to Qatar’s sustainable development.

   abstract = {Even though there is significant growth in online purchasing platforms globally, interaction with such platforms is not very popular in less developed countries (LDCs) like Yemen and needs further investigation. Thus, this empirical research aims to investigate the determinants of Yemeni consumers’ interaction intention to purchase online (IIPO) as a context for LDCs. The research developed an extended model of the technology acceptance model (TAM) by adding technology infrastructure (TI), technology anxiety (TA), social influence (SI), and self-efficacy (SE) as independent variables that impact IIPO. The study model further included technology infrastructure as a moderator. The suggested model was investigated through quantitative research with a sample of 273 Yemeni consumers. The results were estimated using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that TI, SI, and SE have a direct positive impact on IIPO. However, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and TA showed an insignificant direct impact on IIPO. Moreover, technology infrastructure moderates the relationship between (perceived ease of use, TA, SE) and IIPO. A technology infrastructure, in contrast, does not moderate the relationships between other determinants (such as perceived usefulness and SI) and IIPO. The suggested model interpreted 70.5% of the variance in IIPO and 51.7% in perceived usefulness. There is a scarcity of empirical research investigating online purchasing behaviour in LDCs. In Yemen, particularly, the factors influencing Yemeni consumers’ interaction intention to purchase online have not been empirically determined. Moreover, this is one of the first studies to explore the moderate role of technological infrastructure in online purchasing. In this regard, this research claims its uniqueness. More implications were discussed in this study.},

All education institutions were forced to shut down until further notice and were forced to come up with creative solutions to continue with the learning process. Based on existing literature, students and faculty feedback, and interview responses obtained from top management of higher education institutions in several countries, this paper proposes an agile educational framework for higher education institutions to be better prepared for teaching/learning in the digital age for the long term, and for the upcoming academic years in the short term. The proposed framework encompasses the major components that contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of online, hybrid or traditional face-to-face instruction mode.},

By mining the social media posts, a picture of users’ behavior may be obtained, to predict mental illnesses, like depression. Depression is seen as a taboo in the Arab world and cannot be discussed publicly out of fear of criticism. This led many to express their feelings over social media as an escape. Research has been conducted on the ability to use machine learning to make an early-stage diagnosis of depression. However, there is not enough research on this in the Arab world. This research was conducted on Arab women’s tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic to predict whether they have depression symptoms using machine learning. The proposed contribution is to create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict depression from tweets. The model is evaluated using 10000 tweets extracted from 200 users and the obtained results shows its effectiveness.},

In this study, comics were used to explore students’ experiences with and perceptions of distance learning (DL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Female university students were chosen as a purposive sample to discover deep sociocultural meanings in society that could be invisible to men. This study analyzed thirty-two comics created by students using a suggested new analytical framework that draws on systemic functional linguistics theory. The findings were categorized into three dimensions: ideational (who, where, and what), interpersonal (relationships and emotions), and textual (main themes of the comics’ stories). Quantitative content analysis was applied to analyze ideational and interpersonal dimensions (frequency), and qualitative analysis was applied to analyze textual dimensions (themes). Thematic analyses were categorized into three themes: challenges, advantages, and disadvantages. The findings were interpreted through a cultural lens in a style that presents the chief subjects that should be carefully considered in future scenarios of digital education. Several implications and future studies are suggested, especially about cultural issues in education, the quality of DL, and addressing the challenges and disadvantages associated with it.},

   abstract = {The antecedents and determinants of entrepreneurial capabilities and competencies remain one of the incontestable questions that drive the exploitation and discovery of effective financial and digital opportunities. In the present paper, we propose a conceptual model based on Kirzner’s alertness theory [entrepreneurial alertness] and rely on two factors [entrepreneurial orientation and marketing orientation] as key accelerators of entrepreneurial financial alertness. We assume that entrepreneurial financial alertness (EFA) might have a direct impact on entrepreneurial finance-based digital transformation (EFDT), which in turn, is expected to predict both innovation entrepreneurial finance (IEF) and SMEs’ entrepreneurial performance (SMEEP). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed using data collected from a purposive sample size of 214 Jordanian entrepreneurs. Our findings largely support the impact of EFA on EFDT. EFDT was also supported having a significant impact on both IEF and SMEEP. Our study has many implications for both researchers and practitioners in the area of entrepreneurial finance-based digital transformation. The study has great added-value by proposing and examining a solid theoretical foundation covering the most influential factors that drive digital entrepreneurial transformation as such transformation stands as an emerging and pressing issue, not fully tackled by prior studies.},

   abstract = {Saudi universities have suspended the traditional face-to-face classes and moved to online learning to ensure the continuation of the educational process during the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed at which the move to online learning has happened was unprecedented and staggering. Academics, had to improvise and try different e-learning solutions in less-than-ideal circumstances. No matter how powerful and easy-to-use e-learning solutions might be, many academics understandably found the transition to e-learning stressful. This research project looks at the transition experience to online learning from the viewpoint of academics in Saudi universities. It investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the adoption of e-learning solutions and how this forced experience would affect the long-term adoption of e-learning solutions. The study employed an online survey administered to academics from all the 24 public universities. The results were quantitatively analysed by using structural equation modelling (SEM). It was found that attitudes toward e-learning, self-efficacy and perceived reliability have significant positive effects on behavioural intention to adopt e-learning. It was also found that COVID-19 has positively affected the long-term adoption of e-learning. Therefore, it is recommended that universities take immediate actions and capitalise on the e-learning experience that academics have gained during COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The number of gig workers has been rising across the world, reflecting the growing trend toward the gig economy, which is already functioning in various sectors, such as transport(eg, Uber), technology (eg, Appen), and others (eg, Upwork). However, application of gig economy in health care is underresearched, especially in areas of eHealth that can facilitate various online activities and be outsourced. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the gig economy and eHealth in terms of prospects for future health care in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Analysis of data collected using online semistructured interviews with 19 experts, including executives from ministries of health and information and communications, physi-cians, and health-care administrative managers was conducted and new empirical insights are offered. Results: A lack of legal and regulatory frameworks and integrating gig culture into the eHealth system were identified to be the major challenges. Improved operational efficiency of health care, reduced costs, and positive societal impact were identified to be the opportunities and benefits of using the gig economy and eHealth in Saudi Arabia. A strategic framework and an effective regulatory framework are essential for integrating the gig economy into the eHealth system in Saudi Arabia and improving future health care by adopting innovative artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies. Conclusion: eHealth has major scope for future health-care operations in Saudi Arabia and use of the gig economy in eHealth may lead to effective management of eHealth operations. More studies are required to evaluate the idea of integrating the gig economy and eHealth and analyze its impact.},

This study focuses on identifying and analysing the role of competitive pressure as a contextual variable that can moderate the effects of these factors on the adoption intention. A survey of 220 IT managers revealed that compatibility, relative advantage, and top management support are positively perceived factors as they foster the firms’ intentions to adopt BDA in SCM. Their effects on intentions were positively moderated by competitive pressure as a contextual variable. However, BDA complexity and organisational readiness were not supported as influencing firms’ intentions to adopt BDA. The statistical analyses also indicated that the effects of complexity and organisational readiness on intentions are not significantly moderated by competitive pressure. This study contributes to the literature by emphasising the interaction between TOE factors, instead of considering them separately. It also offers guidance to managers aiming to adopt and use BDA in SCM.},

New, cutting-edge sales technologies such as predictive sales analytics, virtual or augmented reality, or AI bots hold the promise of significant productivity gains, yet, simultaneously may entail insidious side effects for sales employees and companies. While past research made significant progress in understanding the benefits of these new technologies, the intricate ‘human side’ of the digital transformation remains relatively ‘uncharted territory’. With this special issue, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the human side in digital transformation of sales—to augment academic knowledge, provide immediate guidance to practitioners, and improve academic sales education.

This paper conceptualizes the effects of digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. It focuses on understanding the effects of causal factors (COVID-19 and digital transformation, on teachers’ beliefs and practices. In the context of this conceptual paper, we delineate this to university education but argue that it is conceptually applicable to any educational setting. Our exploration of the phenomenon has yielded the conclusion that beliefs/attitudes are fluid, are formed cyclically, and that teachers’ associated behaviour/practices are located along a continuum and are influenced by both technological and personal factors. We believe our arguments are valid because when COVID-19 fades as an “event”, the world will have evolved new norms that include newer practices, inevitably informed by technological and personal factors. We provide a basis for understanding the effects of digitally transformed environments and how one might respond to such eventualities. We suggest a theoretical model that outlines the moderating constructs inherent in any digitally transformed environment. The theoretical model provides a hook for research into the beliefs-practice nexus and as a basis for supporting teachers in digitally transformed environments.},

However, many studies have reported on how educationalists and students have responded to the transition from the traditional classrooms to an emergency remote learning and teaching. Prominent researchers in the field strongly argue that teachers' contexts exert a critical role in influencing teachers' resilience. There are fewer studies that targeted resilience during COVID-19. Research into resilience in education is relatively new, approximately 10–15 years old. A global compilation of emergency remote education was conducted in 2020. This paper draws on the 2020 research compilation, and further shares its findings through a resilience lens. The study was conducted at a Saudi Arabian university and employed a mixed-method research approach. This paper reports on the qualitative findings only. Findings from this study have shown that gender inequity may be the contributing factor that female educators experienced. They experienced challenges in terms of personal resources and internal processes; however, despite these setbacks, teachers have adapted and coped regardless of material challenges.},

   abstract = {The increasingly unprecedented incidents (e.g. COVID-19) have made the contemporary supply chains more vulnerable to divergent risks and disruptions. Encouragingly, the recent trend of digital transformation, adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies (I4Ts), could significantly improve business processes extenuating potential risks and disruptions. Yet, there is a paucity of quantitative studies on the risk or disruption mitigation and I4Ts, specifically on agri-food industry. Using a sample of 302 firms from the Australian agri-food supply chains, we explore if the firms that adopt I4Ts experience the different impact of operational risks (supply-demand mismatch, financial and transportation) compared to others. The findings unveil that albeit such risks can significantly undermine firm performance, their negative effect is non-significant for the firms that adopt I4Ts compared to those that do not adopt. We thus suggest digital transformation as an effective way to extenuate operational risks and disruptions amid unanticipated events like COVID-19. Numerous contributions to theory and practice, plus United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (1 & 2) have been discussed.},

IoT and blockchain security is a subset of cybersecurity that protects against IoT-related threats. Therefore, the simultaneous combination of these technologies and the creation of a supply chain based on the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) and blockchain, in addition to increasing the performance of activities in supply chain processes, can also bring many security challenges to this smart supply chain. Because the data collected by IoT devices and stored in the blockchain-based systems that manage them are much more sensitive than traditional network security strategies.Due to the importance of this issue, in this study, an attempt has been made to analyse these security indicators in the AIoT and blockchain-based intelligent supply chain using a combined decision-making method in a fuzzy neutrosophic environment. Understanding these security measures will definitely help to implement more secure and powerful smart supply chains. The results showed that customer privacy criteria have the highest priority.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate core institutional change readiness factors for Industry 4.0, with focus on institutional innovation that sustains technology trajectories and supports technology use in an emerging economy. Using the Delphi methodology with a panel of 71 triple helix (i.e. university, industry, and government) experts, the research identifies, selects, and prioritizes collaboration and capability readiness factors. Initial literature review identifies 50 readiness factors and subsequent non-parametric tests find that ‘clarity of goals and relevance’ and ‘innovating competencies’ are the topmost collaboration and capability factors, respectively. Discussions on these findings imply integrated analyses based on the triple helix as well as institutional and ‘clarity-creativity’ dyadic framings for technology management studies of Industry 4.0. The managerial implications of the research centre on factor-based recommendations concerning support systems for Industry 4.0 transdisciplinary collaboration and action plans for building digital capability, in furtherance of the fourth industrial revolution.

The study involves semi-structured interviews with 28 managers and strategists from various triple helix (i.e. educational, industrial and governmental) institutions in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Using thematic analysis and guided by a constructivist perspective, the study finds sets of themes for reform essentialities and value expectancies associated with institutional innovation for Industry 4.0 education. Reform essentialities pertain to educational system flexibility and funding, school curriculum revision and restructuring and high-performance talent and training. Similarly, value expectancy entails skills-focused programmes for lifelong and project-based learning, students-focused programmes for agile and responsive specialities, public-oriented programmes for empowering and transforming mind-sets and research-oriented programmes for developing and sustaining competencies. Managerially, this study stresses the need for multi-level (i.e. organisational-institutional-regional) strategic alignment that promotes and enhances co-evolution of institutions with technological advances. The study also highlights the practical role of programme-driven innovation for institutions to focus strategic foresight and readiness to cope with Industry 4.0 education demands through skills-focused, students-focused, public-oriented and research-oriented programmes.},

The complexity of implementing such technologies and uncertainties regarding the technological requirements, benefits, and organizational impacts make investment decisions challenging in this context. We propose an investment appraisal framework for I4.0 technologies adoption based on a multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. Using the Innovation Diffusion and Sociotechnical theories, we build a framework with three main stages (knowledge, persuasion, and decision) to guide practitioners through an analysis of I4.0 investments from three different perspectives: Economic, Financial, and Sociotechnical factors. We provide conceptual criteria for investment appraisal and a methodological approach to combine quantitative and qualitative data for the comparative assessment. We show an empirical application of this framework to assess ten I4.0 technology projects proposed in a multinational company. The application helps to illustrate the use of this tool. It brings new practical insights into how to organize I4.0 investment projects into the following categories: strategic or structuring, value-creating, and side investments. We also show the need to include several qualitative requirements and benefits in the technology evaluation to obtain a more robust view of Industry 4.0 investment priorities.},

Effective risk communication by health authorities, through relaying reliable and authoritative information, is imperative in combating the spread of the outbreak. We aimed to measure the effectiveness of risk communication campaign and overall awareness during COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Saudi Arabia. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 5472 individuals in Saudi Arabia was conducted to assess several factors regarding the risk communication messages during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the knowledge and response of the general population toward COVID-19 and MoH efforts. The questionnaire was divided into five main sections: general knowledge of COVID-19, channels and social media platforms used perceived risk and stress or panic toward COVID-19, satisfaction and community perception, most trusted source of information, and type of information received. Results: A total of 5472 individuals participated in the study residing in Saudi Arabia. Overall knowledge of COVID-19 was determined to be above average (0.58 + 0.159). Of the general population, 57.1% perceived that the risk of getting sick with COVID-19 is low, while nearly half of the respondents (45.7%) have a high level of stress and panic toward COVID-19. The majority of responders to the questionnaire reinforced that MoH was their most trusted source of information for the COVID-19 pandemic (91.7%). Conclusion: This study showed that the risk communication campaign by healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic has improved the awareness among the general population in Saudi Arabia, where the overwhelming majority placed high trust in the MoH as its main reference for COVID-19 information.},

In this paper, we assess the role of public sector corruption perception on corporate bond market variables in Europe using data of both country-level corporate bond indexes and firm-level corporate bond market issuances. At the aggregate country level, we find some evidence that country indices of corporate bonds' yields and coupons are higher in countries with more corruption. While we do not find effects of corruption on coupon rates at the individual firm level, we show that higher government corruption perception increases their yield to maturity and reduces the amounts raised by corporations through their bond issuances.},

   abstract = {Digital transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) allows Industry 4.0 and the internet of things (IIoT) to make significant advancements in automating, controlling, and improving the quality of numerous manufacturing processes. Three-dimensional (3D) surface topography of manufactured products holds important information about the quality of manufacturing processes. Surface topography consists of unique properties, which makes the current monitoring approaches ineffective in identifying local and spatial surface faults. In this paper, we develop a generalised spatially weighted autocorrelation approach based on AI for monitoring changes in products based on their 3D topographic surfaces. We propose two effective algorithms to identify and assign spatial weights to the topographic regions with suspicious characteristics. The normal surface hard thresholding algorithm initially enhances the representation of surface characteristics through binarization, followed by the normal surface connected-component labelling algorithm, which utilises the obtained binary results to identify and assign spatial weights to the suspicious regions. We then introduce a generalised spatially weighted Moran index, which exploits the assigned weights to locally characterise and monitor changes in the spatial autocorrelation structure of identified regions. After an anomaly surface is detected, we extract different fault diagnostic information. The proposed approach proves its robustness and efficiency in characterising, monitoring, and diagnosing different patterns of faults in 3D topographic surfaces.},

It aimed to identify the readiness and ability of digital entrepreneurs, especially small ones, to deal with customers’ shift to online purchasing. It also aimed to determine the means and mechanisms that enable digital entrepreneurs to digitally adapt to take advantage of this opportunity. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to the study sample to collect the necessary data to test the study's hypotheses. The focus of the study was on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, that reached 384. And the study uses multiple regression analysis to test this hypothesis. The study concluded that digital entrepreneurs could adapt digitally by targeting customers properly and digitally engaging customers to establish an interaction with them, which is one of the most important foundations of digital business activities. They can also adapt digitally through search engine optimisation; adaptation to smartphones, one of the basics of digital adaptation in digital entrepreneurship; and shifting from the traditional supply chain to the digital value chain.},

   abstract = {Although the willingness to share is huge, sharing is rarely applied in everyday life, because many current Sharing Economy offers are not practicable. This paper asks what contributions an innovative Sharing Service–a library not simply lending books but a wider range of items–can make to close the gap between willingness to share and practice. Most of these innovative libraries were founded in the last few years, but many still fail to overcome the identified gap. As global environmental problems demand a change of consumer behaviour to enable human actions within planetary boundaries, bridging the gap could have a huge impact. Libraries of Things could reduce the average resource and energy consumption of users, maintaining quality of life. This paper analyses existing Libraries of Things and Tool Libraries. The outcome is assessed against empirically proven user expectations to detect the discrepancies between supply and demand of current offers commonly available.},

Six years after the idea was proposed in Harvard Business Review, the world was introduced to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e. Industry 4.0. In this research work, we explore the possibility of collaboration between the two approaches; owing to the fact that there has been a paucity of approaches that discuss the integration of the two concepts. It is posited that the fourth industrial revolution is a boon to the Blue Ocean Strategy. Through a systematic literature review and using a grounded theory approach, we have elicited a relationship between the two approaches and conclude that Industry 4.0 supplements the blue ocean approach and is a key enabler in its implementation. The four-action framework of the Blue Ocean Strategy can be appositely approached via integration with various Industry 4.0 facets. Delving further, it has been observed that the implementation of the six paths framework of the Blue Ocean Strategy is strongly influenced by the Industry 4.0 constituents, specifically BigData, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things; thus helping in achieving market leadership and business sustainability.},

There are yet few studies of the extent and nature of software development across firms. We employ a unique firm-level survey comprising 3,929 firms across Sweden to analyse the distribution and characteristics of firms that invest in software development and the orientation of their investments. The results confirm that software development activities are present in most industries, but heterogeneously distributed across firms. Internal software development is associated with innovation-oriented large firms in high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries, and is often affiliated with MNEs. The results suggest that software development is comparable to R&D investments and constitutes an example of digital innovation. This strengthens the value of studying software development activities to understand how firms invest in and build competitive advantage in the digitalised economy.},

The empirical results sustain the hypothesis of convergence of the degree of digital level in the European Union member countries. In evaluating the convergence process, we also aimed to investigate the role of economic development and education, measured by gross value added and education index. The analysis results, the use of sigma and beta convergence methods, showed that the role of economic development is likely to be decisive in resolving disparities, as opposed to that of educational development. The sigma convergence analysis showed that the gap between the EU-28 countries regarding digitalisation tends to decrease in the analysed period. Spatial data analysis, in turn, provides strong evidence for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the DESI distribution. This result is based on a spatial lagged model that considers that DESI growth rates are related both to their initial levels of digitalisation and the growth rates of neighbouring regions.},

Since then digital technologies have progressed significantly and their speed and pervasiveness have generated and are still causing the digital transformation of our society. This creates new opportunities and challenges for the realization of DE. ‘What is DE today?’, ‘What could DE be in the future?’, and ‘What is needed to make DE a reality?’. To answer these questions it is necessary to examine DE considering all the technological, scientific, social, and economic aspects, but also bearing in mind the principles that inspired its formulation. By understanding the lessons learned from the past, it becomes possible to identify the remaining scientific and technological challenges, and the actions needed to achieve the ultimate goal of a ‘Digital Earth for all’. This article reviews the evolution of the DE vision and its multiple definitions, illustrates what has been achieved so far, explains the impact of digital transformation, illustrates the new vision, and concludes with possible future scenarios and recommended actions to facilitate full DE implementation.},

We describe conditions under which, even though the unobserved market characteristic cannot be identified, a subset of parameters of the model can still be identified, including all the strategic-interaction effects. We also characterize testable implications for strategic behavior by the incumbent when this player is able to shift the unobserved market characteristic to deter entry. We present results under Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) and under the weaker behavioral model of iterated elimination of nonrationalizable strategies. Our empirical example analyzes geographic entry decisions in the Mexican internet service provider (ISP) industry. This industry has an incumbent, América Móvil (AMX), which established a widespread geographic presence as a monopolist following the privatization of Telmex in 1990. Our results show significant strategic interaction effects between AMX and its competitors, as well as evidence of strategic behavior by AMX to deter entry and maximize its market share.},

However, more knowledge is needed about what instructional videos exist and how they facilitate vocational learning. This article draws from online video research to explore vocational learning on YouTube for interactive service work. Focusing on connected service encounters in which transactions and customer service are intertwined through interaction with digital technologies, cashier work was used as the empirical case. With concepts from narrative and multimodal analysis, the theory of practice architectures was the framework for analysing 160 YouTube videos for cashier work. The article proposes a taxonomy of online instructional video types for VET and workplace learning comprising nine video types divided into two main categories: professional instructional videos and peer instructional videos (vlogs). It is found that transactions and customer service are instructed separately. Consequently, YouTube videos do not yet prepare learners for connected service encounters. Overall, the taxonomy can contribute to a more purposeful use of video in VET and workplace learning.},

Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM) cultivates a new relationship by engaging customers on social media sites. Old-style CRM is modernizing into SCRM, and the key responsibilities in this new marketing and business environment are Customer Engagement (CE). The present study endeavours to assess how SCRM influences CE by investigating the impact of SCRM on CE and further effect of CE on Customer Loyalty (CL), Customer Retention (CR) and Customer Satisfaction (CS). The research is descriptive in nature and self-administered questionnaire was prepared to attain the stated objectives. Primary data were collected from the diverse group of respondents, edited and analysed with the help of statistical tools SPSS and AMOS −18.0. The study concludes that CE occurs through proper CRM, resulting in CL, CR, and CS.},

Data was gathered through a PAN India online survey from users and non users of surrogate shoppers in the travel and finance sectors. Using the conceptual lens of stimulus organism response theory, and the analytical techniques of structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis, this study finds that even though many hypothesized relationships in the PMC model do not hold, usefulness emerges as an important construct even in the face of privacy concerns, and that users and non users of surrogate shoppers differ in their response to PMC with users of surrogate shoppers not showing the responses expected typically of consumers. While targeting non users of surrogate shoppers especially, marketing managers should infuse PMC with usefulness and address privacy concerns of the target market.},

However, although the literature has identified multiple benefits of using this strategy to improve student learning outcomes, its adoption and implementation by teachers in science education remain scarce. This study examines antecedents of science teachers’ flipped teaching readiness to act, aiming to encourage more teachers to use this strategy. The study implemented the General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E-Learning (GETAMEL) approach as the theoretical framework. A cross-sectional research design study, including 398 in-service science teachers, was implemented in five Turkish cities during the first semester of 2022. The results indicated that the GETAMEL approach provided adequate prediction power to explain science teachers’ flipped teaching readiness. It was also shown that all hypotheses were supported, and constructs of the conceptual model were significant activators of intention to use the flipped learning approach for science teaching. Moreover, subjective norm, experience, perceived enjoyment, anxiety, and self-efficacy on perceived usefulness, attitude, and intention acted as mediator constructs. Overall, this study guides researchers and practitioners to better comprehend science teachers’ flipped teaching readiness.},

With transportation being one of the most pollutant sectors, focus has been directed towards Electric Vehicles, due to their significantly less dependency on fossil fuels. Nevertheless, electric mobility is currently characterized by a limited driving range, leading manufacturers to investigating new methods that could increase range and charging efficiency. Current research is mainly focused on increasing battery performance and reducing charging time. This study concentrates on presenting a novel approach, based on replacing battery stations, where the vehicle’s batteries are replaced with a fully charged one (available at the station), while new modular batteries could be made on the spot. The existing gas station networks could be used for the replacement of electric car batteries. This will be addressing the issue of time-consuming charging of batteries. Through the assimilation of Industry 4.0 Key Enabling Technologies, the respective challenges can be addressed. This is illustrated through a holistic framework, whereby the requirements for the context-aware design of the car itself are also given and a specific solution, based on the mechanical mounting of batteries is discussed.},

Through interviews with construction professionals, this paper identifies the capabilities needed in construction firms to enable the accrual of the potentially transformative benefits of big data application in construction. Based on previous studies, big data application capabilities, needed to transform construction processes, focussed on data, people, technology, and organisation. However, the findings of this research suggest a critical modification to that focus to include knowledge and the organisational environment along with people, data, and technology. The research findings show that construction firms use big data with a combination strategy to enable transformation by (a) driving an in-house data management policy to rolling-out the big data capabilities; (b) fostering collaborative capabilities with external firms for resource development, and (c) outsourcing big data services to address the capabilities deficits impacting digital transformation.},

Although value creation is contingent on a multiplicity of contextual factors, extant research has mainly explored fulfilment in the generic realms of e-commerce and does not provide empirically grounded insights into the collective interplay of fulfilment attributes. Because e-grocery features unique exigencies and trade-offs that require non-generic theorisation, a functional and cross-domain perspective is required to comprehend the role of fulfilment in creating value in this sector. Following a multi-method approach, this paper combines a literature review with an empirical investigation of 111 e-grocers to produce three main outcomes. First, a conceptually-grounded and empirically-refined taxonomy to capture important decision attributes of e-grocery fulfilment. Second, six archetypes to indicate common combinations of these attributes. Third, a contingency model to disclose value relationships between attributes and outcome performance. Our results contribute to the body of knowledge on e-grocery value creation as well as the explanatory understanding of operational configurations and digital transformation conditions in this industry.},

Yet, many are reticent to embrace this service innovation for their wealth management. This study probes this phenomenon by examining the interplay among technology characteristics (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived security), human-like characteristics (i.e. perceived autonomy, perceived intelligence, and perceived anthropomorphism), and consumer characteristics (i.e. financial literacy and affinity for technology interaction) to explain the acceptance of robo-advisory services. For this purpose, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis and an artificial neural network analysis were performed to uncover the interdependency and complexity of the proposed variables, based on 375 responses collected through a large consumer panel survey in China. The findings revealed the presence of six configurations conducive for high acceptance of robo-advisory services, with perceived anthropomorphism and a combination of perceived effort expectancy and perceived security identified as core conditions. Moreover, according to the artificial neural network analysis, perceived intelligence is the most important determinant of robo-advisory service acceptance. This study challenges the conventional linear and symmetric perspective adopted in prior research.},

This work analyses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing technological exposure of employees to emotional exhaustion and work-family conflict. It also analyses the role that social support and mindfulness play as mechanisms that inhibit technostress in a context of health emergency. For this purpose, the authors develop and test a structural equation model on a sample of 1037 employees of the banking industry in Spain. The results show that the techno-stressors increase emotional exhaustion and the work-family conflict. We also observe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on the perception of techno-stressors and on emotional exhaustion. In addition, the results show that social support and mindfulness play a crucial role in diminishing technostress, as they reduce the perceived COVID-19 impact, techno-stressors and emotional exhaustion. Consequently, this work presents very relevant implications for organisations, identifying strategies that allow to reduce technostress and work-family conflict.},

The majority (97%) preferred the use of PAEHRs for appointments, 95% for drug delivery and to view laboratory tests, and 92% in requesting medical reports. In our survey, 22% of patients with cancer reported that their medical cancer care had not been affected by COVID-19. They reported that trusted sources of information during COVID-19 included the Ministry of Health with 98% and doctors with 94%. Sixtyone percent know that they are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and 91% of respondents supported the notion of digital transformation in the caring of cancer patients. Conclusion: Our study revealed a general acceptance of patients to telecommunication as substitute to in-person interaction with their physicians. Interaction between cancer patients and health care providers should not be disrupted but should be augmented with more effective platforms to improve health care outcomes.},

   abstract = {As organizations emerge from the disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming evident that the sales function has shifted irrevocably toward increased reliance on technological resources to facilitate inherent processes and activities. Integrating research from the dynamic capabilities and sales capabilities literature, this study examines why some organizations are more adept than others at harnessing and leveraging emergent technological resources to enhance sales operations. Specifically, we develop and test a theoretical framework of the antecedents and consequences of technology-enabled sales capability, a firm-level operational capability that captures the embeddedness of technology in sales processes and activities. The framework proposes that three firm-level dynamic capabilities—technology-sensing capability, vigilant market learning capability, and adaptive sales capability—are positively related to technology-enabled sales capability, which in turn is positively related to financial performance and customer relationship performance. The framework also explores the moderating effects of top management technology advocacy and two environmental variables—technological and market turbulence—on the development and deployment of technology-enabled sales capability. Based on findings from data gathered from 224 business-to-business sales managers, we extend theoretical and managerial contributions and provide directions for future research.},

These logics capture the dominant ways of thinking in BPM, reflected in its assumptions, practices and values. While the three logics have proven useful in prior contexts, we argue that the applicability of these underlying assumptions in theorising BPM needs to be re-examined in the context of digital transformation. Based on an ethnographic study of BPM in a company undergoing digital transformation, we uncover tensions related to applying these prior logics that point to the need to update the underlying assumptions. Consequently, we propose new logics that we conceptualise as light touch processes (process), infrastructural flexibility (infrastructure) and mindful actors (agency). Our observations contribute to a rethinking of the dominant BPM logics by unpacking their dynamics in the context of digital transformation. Our study further highlight salient differences between digital transformation and IT-enabled organisational transformation contexts. We conclude by proposing new managerial approaches for BPM in digital transformation contexts.},

One example of this was the introduction and use of software such as Microsoft (MS) Teams as a learning tool and platform to continue education provisions. As such, this study reports on the implementation of MS Teams to deliver a foundation year physical science curriculum within a hybrid learning context over the 2020/2021 academic year and within multiple learning contexts. In-built data analytics from MS Teams were used to measure student engagement and activity on the software. Additionally, a questionnaire was used to capture student perspectives of MS Teams and their use as a learning tool. These data show that the like-for-like replacement of face-to-face teaching with an online alternative within this hybrid approach did not produce a clear like-for-like learning environment for students, except in the case of small-group collaborations where students found clear utility for the platform. Significant thought needs to be given to the use of online and hybrid alternatives to traditional face-to-face instruction and, in order to facilitate student learning and engagement effectively, a bottom-up approach to redesign may be required instead of simply substituting teaching tools.},

Drawing on data collected through content analysis for the period of June 2021 to July 2021, we found that Digital-only audio websites dominate in terms of niche breadth and competitive superiority in all content categories except news and information as compared to AM/FM websites. Digital-only audio websites have occupied the niche in the Entertainment content category. Higher niche overlap was observed in the news and information category, weakening the players’ competitive distinctiveness.},

   abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, mass rural-urban migration negatively affectthe agriculture sector that accounts for about 23% of the GDP and employs over 60% of the population. Together with a rapidly changing climate, unplanned urbanization poses serious threats to Africa’s agriculture sector with the risk of chronic food shortages in the future. To stem this tide, it is imperative to systematically assess the unplanned urbanization trend from a socio-economic perspective and distill the broader implication for sustainable urban farming within the context of climate change in the region. The potentials of digitalization as a tool for transformative adaptation to climate change and enabler of sustainable development in different domains, including agriculture, are beginning to emerge. However, most studies are based on data from Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. There is minimal documentation of current applications and prospects of digitalization for sustainable agricultural practices in Africa, particularly in an increasingly urbanized era. Thus, this study addresses this need by evaluating the potentials of digitalization to enable sustainable farming in the face of unprecedented climate change constraints in Africa and minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on agriculture. Through a desk research approach, the present study explores the challenges to digital farming in Africa despite its successful implementation in the global North. Drawing lessons from successful case-studies worldwide, we suggest possible pathways to overcome the challenges and implement localized digitalization approaches to strengthen preventive action against climate risks, enhance disaster preparedness, and aid effective planning and management of agriculture practices. Integrating agriculture into the city via digital urban farming is crucial for long-term food security and creating appealing clean-tech jobs for a large number of new immigrants, thereby supporting African cities’ resilience and sustainable development.},

In the interview, Anu shares how the CEO-CIO dynamics have changed significantly in the past ten to fifteen years. She also highlights how IT is now driving the business strategy, and the CIO is trusted with business roles rather than a back-office role. As a female CIO, Anu offers unique perspectives on the challenges faced by women in the IT world, particularly at the CIO level. During Covid, she and her team embraced the supply chain challenges and turned those into an opportunity to transform IT operations at TE Connectivity. Their efforts have also driven the analytics and insight-driven culture and created more demand for analytical-driven solutions within the business.

In the second stage, action research was conducted to evaluate mPharmaCare adoption. A dual organizational structure was tested to cope with innovation and efficient exploration of pharmacy services. Community Pharmacy 5.0 is an inspiring vision that will take advantage of mobility. However, there are tensions between the core pharmacy business and the new technology layers of community connections. Community pharmacies require both client-centric and community-centric approaches to achieve individualization of patient care and horizontal and end-to-end digital integration of pharmacy data. Digital transformation can remove silos in the community pharmacy. Creating an–internal or outsourced–innovation division may be suitable for medium and large community pharmacies. Moreover, pharmacies must consider shifting to a product-service system offer, deploying synchronization mechanisms with different stakeholders.},

We find that the inclusion of SDI preferences in a multi-objective portfolio yields similar risk-return characteristics as a benchmark portfolio.

In this context, we review and provide an overview of data availability for the classification of companies’ alignment to the SDGs based on their products and services.},

   abstract = {Is there one legitimate form of luxury, or are there many acceptable luxury forms? The answer is that it all depends on the perspective used to define luxury, and who is involved in doing so. Luxury research is a solid field of study. However, most studies in marketing and consumer research focus on the exclusive nature of luxury consumption and mainly adopt a goods-centric and conventional approach. Doing so does not allow scholars to capture the holistic aspects of luxury perceptions and consumption. To address this issue, this review article draws on recent developments calling for more approaches beyond the conventional conceptualization of luxury and advancing our understanding of it. This can be achieved by offering a comprehensive and multilayered framework to define luxury, which is viewed through various theoretical lenses, units of analysis, and the stakeholders involved in luxury domains.},

   abstract = {The marketing mix encompasses the 4Ps used to design tangible offerings and 7Ps for service design. The 4Ps and & 7Ps constitute an integral part of the company’s marketing strategy. However, there has been a surge in consumers who, rather than seeking goods, seek experiences that occur in hybrid settings, namely phygital settings. Combining physical and digital features alongside the spread of technologies and environmental changes has led companies to reconsider their marketing practices by shifting from a product-centric approach to a more experience-centric way of thinking and doing. Consequently, these changes in the marketplace have affected consumers, firms, stakeholders, and, in turn, the marketing mix. The shift has led to the rise of the ‘experiential marketing mix’. The experiential marketing mix is a strategic framework that lies at the heart of the experiential marketing movement. The framework uses the following seven pillars (7Es): experience, exchange, extension, emphasis, empathy capital, emotional touchpoints, and emic/etic process—to help firms design business experiences in the phygital age. Drawing on a holistic perspective, we define relevant areas of marketing developments by answering four key questions–who, what, how, and where–related to the novel domains companies and scholars should consider when implementing marketing strategies, tools, frameworks, and methodologies.},

The moderating effects of two different reactive coping strategies–active-functional and dysfunctional–were investigated within a final sample of 3,362 German knowledge workers. We found a competitive mediation effect where the direct effect of demands on productivity is of opposite direction as the indirect effect. Both, active-functional and dysfunctional coping reduce the extent to which demands lead to strain. The contribution of this paper for technostress research is discussed and implications for future research are given. Recommendations for employers and employees are highlighted.},

Four themes emerged from the dataset: uncertainty, technical and logistical hurdles, inequality, and lack of intimacy.

In this study, we assume that a better alignment among ICT investments, improvements of the logistics process and the value proposition of the firm can lead towards a superior economic performance. A survey was conducted and 180 usable questionnaires were collected from companies engaged in the electronics and vehicle manufacturing industries.

A total of 49 relevant works were retrieved, representing 49 distinct maturity models and tools in various domains. The works were inductively analysed, and the maturity model dimensions were extracted and consolidated into a Digital Maturity Assessment Model (DMAM). The resulting DMAM consisted of 4 dimensions: IT & Digital Technologies, Strategy & Processes Management, Human Resources & Culture, and Supply Chain & Patient Journeys Management. Each dimension is further divided into several sub-dimensions, totally 65 sub-dimensions are identified, that can be assessed by the 4 digital maturity levels proposed. The comparison of the proposed digital maturity dimensions and sub-dimensions with the existing models/tools shows a clear and important contribution in the field of digital transformation assessment: the introduction of a new dimension ‘Supply Chain and Patient Management’, that was developed in response to practitioner needs and organizational factors in pharmaceutical supply chain.},

   abstract = {The debate about the digitalization has gained momentum in recent years. While digitalization technologies are globally hailed as drivers of increased productivity, they are not yet used on a grand scale, which begs the question why, because their benefits are clear. We address this question by deriving a model of how digitalization technologies impact on productivity and what barriers affect their use. We focus exemplarily on Germany’s building construction industry in order to estimate the benefits of digitalization, using three case studies of production robots, 3D printing and BIM software. In a second step, we build a model using qualitative interviews based on the Technology Acceptance Model. A first qualitative study defines the level of detail and identifies unknown influencing factors. In a second study, the model was revised by means of qualitative-structured interviews. Finally, we carried out a quantitative evaluation of the model using a questionnaire, evaluating its suitability.},

   abstract = {In response to strong revenue and income losses facing a large share of self-employed individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government introduced a €50bn emergency-aid program. Based on real-time online-survey data comprising more than 20,000 observations, we analyze the impact of this program on the confidence to survive the crisis. We investigate how the digitalization level of self-employed individuals influences the program’s effectiveness. Employing propensity score matching, we find that the emergency-aid program had only moderately positive effects on the confidence of self-employed to survive the crisis. However, self-employed whose businesses were highly digitalized, benefitted much more from the state aid than those whose businesses were less digitalized. This only holds true for those self-employed, who started the digitalization processes already before the crisis. Taking a regional perspective, we find suggestive evidence that the quality of the regional broadband infrastructure matters in the sense that it increases the effectiveness of the emergency-aid program. Our findings show the interplay between governmental support programs, the digitalization levels of entrepreneurs, and the regional digital infrastructure. The study helps public policy to improve the impact of crisis-related policy instruments, ultimately increasing the resilience of small firms in times of crises.},

The consumer finds ease in shopping domestic appliances online as compared to traditional shopping. The present study is being conducted to investigate the factors that influence customers' online purchasing intentions (COPI) whereby trust (TT), perceived use and usefulness (PEUU), e-service quality (ESQL), perceived behavior control (PBC), subjective norms (SNM) and consumer online shopping behavior (COSB) were analyzed. A questionnaire was utilised as a survey tool to collect data from 383 respondents using a quantitative methodology. The data were examined using structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the hypothesis, fit the model, and determine the relationship between the variables evaluated. The analysis concluded that consumer online purchase intention (COPI) acts as a mediator between the independent variables (TT, PEUU, ESQL, PBC, SNM) and the dependent variable consumer online shopping behavior (COSB). According to the findings, perceived use and usefulness (PEUU) had a negative influence on purchase intention and behaviour, but consumer online purchase intention had a substantial effect on consumer online purchasing behaviour. The study provides scope and new avenues for future research. In addition to this, it also provides the platform for other researchers to target a specific age, gender, education, or marital status to design a new pattern of online shopping.

We initially run a sigma convergence analysis and the results show convergence in the total expenditure, due to the behaviour of the business and higher education sectors, despite government sector divergence. However, noticeable differences between the EU15 and 13 EU countries are apparent. The business enterprise sector is the main driver of EU15 R&D convergence, whereas for the EU13 this role is played by the government expenditure. In addition, the economic crisis has impacted differently on both groups. The club convergence approach allows us to explore these insights through individualized analysis and clusterization. Results for the EU28 show two clubs for the total expenditure, but the analysis of its components reveals a larger grouping. Our results evidence the necessity of revising the EU R&D policies towards greater coordination and resources, and the implementation of new instruments, due to the impact of this expenditure on growth, development and integration.},

The chance was taken for an instructional redesign deviating from the conventional cookbook-experiment to better integrate the changing competence demands of the working world 4.0 (W4.0). A real-world scenario (RWS) is used to address the sometimes-vague problem-solving assignments of W4.0: the students found themselves in an ambiguous situation which must be cleared and resolved constructively and autonomously by them. The RWS was evaluated by triangulating qualitative and quantitative methods. Firstly, its Constructive Alignment was evaluated, i.e. whether the intended learning outcomes to be achieved through the novel teaching and learning activities were reflected in the assessment tasks, too. Secondly, students were surveyed regarding their attitudes towards such new forms of laboratory learning. The results show that even if the students initially seem overwhelmed by the unfamiliar type of assignment, they are nevertheless able to solve the work-related engineering problem–at least with varying degrees of assistance from a fictional immediate superior. The students appreciate the opportunity to think creatively and independently develop solutions to the assignment.},

   abstract = {The digital transformation of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) is being hailed as a panacea for the sectors’ problems, with major actors in government and business promoting it as a benevolent harbinger of greater efficiency, productivity, better quality, and environmental performance. However, advancing digitalization in AEC is intertwined with a distinct political-economic logic that involves new constraints, dependencies, and a reconfiguration of power relations. Specifically, Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a digital convergence of three-dimensional building models, databases, and interfaces for multidisciplinary collaboration operates as a runway technology for digitalization and an entry point for platformization impelled by global software giants, such as this article’s empirical case of software company Autodesk and its BIM product portfolio shows. BIM’s linkage of governmental policy strategies with the techno-economic platform logic of software subscription models, open application programming interfaces, and cloud-enabled collaboration ensures management and control of construction data and software interoperability. At the same time, BIM’s techno-economic and political configuration facilitates a near-monopolistic structure in the global architecture and construction software market. It thus grants one hegemonic company immense power to define what formats, standards, and data for building models and design processes are being used in creating the built environment. The expansive, intersecting logics of assetization, platformization, and datafication have been taking hold in the AEC sector, raising questions about their stratifying effects in the built environment and society.},

The average effects of CCIs are positive in the three territorial scales, in both low- and high-income locations, and increase in conjunction with increases in development, with high and very high developed places showing greater impacts. CCIs are, thus, a powerful resource for improving the well-being of rich and poor places at all geographic scales; however, they also act as a double-edged sword, as they increase inequalities between places.},

Accordingly, governments have invested vastly in formal education aimed at developing them. Policies and directives driving this venture need to be examined. Otherwise, their potential risks being thwarted. By means of a post-foundational discourse analysis, six moments central to the political enablement of Chile’s State Technical Formation Centres underwent a synchronic heuristic discourse analysis as understood under relational-ontology. These Centres are part of Chile’s tertiary Technical and Vocational Education and Training system and were created as a means for the State to regain presence within such a system. Findings show unquestioned facts which lead to the articulation of two prominent myths. Added, two salient discourses are articulated to the myth: education is either articulated with statements that would frame education as a right or with development statements. Furthermore, despite these documents articulating today’s world as being driven by information and technological developments, there is no mention, definition or even acknowledgement of digital abilities. Accordingly, the development of these rhetorically articulated indispensable abilities, within these Centres, is left to chance. Findings shed light on how mythification of discourses can lead to hindering consequences.},

Guided by the theory that IT and CT differently affect firms' production processes, we investigate the complementarities between these two distinct technologies and workers' levels of education in affecting firms' productivity. Exploiting within-firm variation between 2005 and 2017, we find that the use of IT–measured as use of business management tools–is particularly beneficial for workers with a tertiary vocational education. In contrast, CT–measured as workers' use of the intranet–is especially complementary to workers with a tertiary academic education. While consistent with the ICT-driven skills-biased technological change hypothesis, our results offer evidence on the necessity for differentiating between the effects of IT and CT on firm productivity when differently educated workers use these technologies.},

The traditional business model of LOOROs is challenged by digitalization pressure imposed by online and offline competitors on the one side and by changing shopping habits of their customers on the other. Despite all digitally-enabled opportunities to regain competitive power, LOOROs still hesitate to adopt digital tools and applications. The aim of this study is to examine drivers and barriers of the digitalization of LOOROs to identify possible trigger points that can promote their digital development. Therefore, we conducted a survey among 223 LOORO owners from 26 cities in Germany. The results indicate high uncertainty among SME retailers about what to do and where to begin the path towards digitalization. LOOROs positive attitude towards digitalization is the only driver. Furthermore, LOOROs face manifold barriers, including lack of available resources, low perception of external pressures, low intentions to use and low current use of digitalization. Our findings reveal that the use of digital tools and applications for administration and marketing could work as a suitable trigger to promote digital development and are promising starting points for LOOROs.},

The model is developed in holonic paradigm as a 2-layer Holonic Logistics Execution System (HLES) in semi-heterarchical topology. Scheduling of logistics activities and allocation to resources are optimised for global efficiency on compact time periods. The logistics model virtualises physical entities: resources, pallets and orders as holons implemented with digital twin software, and categories of task workloads: resource health monitoring, dispatching and tracking pallet orders, re-assigning jobs at resource failure, which grants reality-awareness and robustness. Global workload optimisation uses Constraint Programming as decision making technology with ILOG optimiser engine as situation-specific solver tool in SaaS cloud model, and delegate multi-agent system (MAS) technology for intelligence distribution. The optimised objective function is a combination of palletising cost weighted by robot speed limits and pallet storage cost in payable stocks. The main constructs are exemplified and validated on a real-life structure with multiple palletising resources in which programmable logic controllers (PLC) coordinate locally the parallel execution of order holons according to their globally optimised sequence.},

This spectrum of activities between concrete and abstract is complex and unexplored in construction but it will be shown that a deep understanding of this is required to make successful buildings in a modern age of digitalization. Abstraction is the simplification of an entity with a degree of generalization of purpose and causality but also used to promote the idealization of the entity. When abstractions are believed to be real then there are conditions of hyperreality. This article unpacks the nature of abstraction in the creation of the built environment through three vignettes of practice; considering: drawings, project planning and building modelling. Abstraction has been key to making buildings but is growing in significance because of building information modelling. The themes of loss of meaning, loss of control and loss of perspective are used to show that digitalization involves creating a dangerous illusion of the connection between data and reality thus creating a problematic hyperreality. This can be avoided by stronger thinking, more openness about abstractions and less exaggeration of their performance.},

Although rational reasoning forms part of this game, futures are established and negotiated through arational techniques of enchantment focused on ‘selling futures’. This challenges rationalist ideas of future-making, demonstrating the heterogenous, more-than-rational processes and distinct organizational logics by which futures are shaped.},

   abstract = {When combined with information and communication technologies and powerful data analytic algorithms such as artificial intelligence, digital twins enable organisations to conserve physical resources. This applies both during the design phase and when performing diagnostic and predictive analyses during operations. These abilities bring significant opportunities to the infrastructure industry to develop new ways of designing, constructing, operating and monitoring infrastructure at a time when much of the world’s civil infrastructure is ageing and showing signs of deterioration. This study aims to find out how digital twins can help the infrastructure industry to deliver and operate sustainable and smart infrastructure assets. This paper presents an overview of digital twin definitions, current practices, benefits and challenges through a series of semi-structured expert interviews with executives from the UK infrastructure industry. Additionally, it suggests a series of strategies to aid digital transformation and digital twin adoption in the industry. Results from the interviews illustrated that the executives involved in digital transformation in the infrastructure industry are very well aware of the definitions, benefits and challenges of digital twins. In general, they understand the value of digital transformation and specifically digital twins. They know the reasons behind the need for transforming the industry and adopting data-driven concepts such as digital twins. Moreover, the executives interviewed as part of this study mentioned common challenges across different infrastructure domains. The strategies presented are focused on addressing these three main challenges identified and agreed upon by the participants–culture, technology adoption and lack of a skilled workforce. The three main strategies, addressing digital transformation (1), cultural transformation (2) and bridging the skills gap (3), are explained later in this paper. The article concludes by underlining the importance of creating equal opportunities for the current workforce to improve their digital fluency and skillset by providing information about the benefits of digital twins throughout the sector and organisations to improve adoption and the realisation of benefits.},

A second is that by becoming key players in the knowledge economy and responding to stakeholder expectations, universities also have taken on new missions in addition to teaching and research. We propose that a series of new challenges arise from interrelations between universities’ internal organisational dynamics and changes in their external relationships. Moreover, we outline the contributions to this special issue, each of which address a specific question through their respective conceptual discussion and/or in-depth examination of these challenges.

   abstract = {Problem: In an era of increasing complexity, leadership development is an urgent need for academic health science centers (AHSCs). The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and others have described the need for a focus on organizational leadership development and more rigorous evaluation of outcomes. Although the business literature notes the importance of evaluating institutional leadership culture, there is sparse conversa-tion in the medical literature about this vital aspect of leadership development. Defining the leadership attributes that best align with and move an AHSC forward must serve as the foundational framework for strategic leadership development. Approach: In 2015, the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) began a systematic process to approach strategic leadership development for the organization. An interprofes-sional group completed an inventory of our leadership development programs and identified key drivers of a new institutional strategic plan. A strategic leadership advisory committee designed a series of leadership retreats to evaluate both individual and collective leadership development needs. Outcomes: Three key drivers were identified as critical attributes for the success of our institutional strategy. Four specific areas of focus for the growth of the institution’s ideal leadership culture were identified, with specific action items or behaviors developed for our leaders to model. As a result of this foundational work, we have now launched the MUSC Leadership Institute. Next Steps: Knowledge of our current leadership culture, key drivers of strategy and our desired collective leadership attributes are the basis for building our institutional leadership development strategy. This will be a longitudinal process that will start with senior leadership engagement, organizational restructuring, new programming and involve significant experi-mentation. Disciplined, thoughtful evaluation will be required to find the right model. In addition to individual transformation with leadership development, MUSC will measure specifically identified strategic outcomes and performance metrics for the institution.},

   abstract = {We explore how digitalization impacts young firms’ growth. A longitudinal panel analysis of the EU’s new ventures during 2010–2018 reveals that digital sectoral capabilities affect young firms’ growth autonomously and via interaction with other sectoral capabilities. Digital sectoral capabilities play an important complementary role in facilitating the upscaling of young firms operating in R&D-intensive contexts as they mature and within environments rich in tangible capital investments. In business contexts characterized by high digital but low human capabilities, young firms struggle to grow, flagging a mismatch of skills’ composition. The effects of digitalization vary depending on the level of competition within each sector. The results on complementarities of sectoral capabilities suggest that horizontal policy solutions favouring specific capabilities in isolation may have limited or counterproductive effects. Instead, policy should target a portfolio of capabilities and consider their complementarities under competitive market structures. Our analysis shows that effective innovation policy should be broadly defined and closely integrated with competition policy.},

We do so by studying a development aid policy programme in Norway targeting the SDGs and transformative change in the global south. The findings show that priority is given to implementing and upscaling Western solutions and that there has been a subordinate orientation towards the local demand these solutions are meant to serve, and to the innovation systems they are meant to strengthen. Based on these findings, we discuss whether this form of technology transfer detached from local production- and innovation systems is the most effective way to secure long-term local capacity building and transformative change in the global south.},

   abstract = {This article considers the transmission of knowledge in higher education. It takes the metaphor of the music industry that pre-selects the music people can buy. The sales potential is the leading principle in the selection process. Often the small producer is excluded because his or her music is not of commercial interest. The end-customer does not know what he or she is missing because he or she has never heard the music. It is to be feared that a similar market principle will also influence the selection of knowledge and affect the capacity of higher education institutions to freely generate and transmit new knowledge. The globalization of higher education risks homogenizing the cultural traditions of the non-Western world through a process of Western cultural domination. On the other hand, the Internet, via open source software like LINUX, might serve to democratize higher education and allow greater grassroots input.

To date, research has largely focused on the technical characteristics of AI and its influence on organisational capabilities. Despite the hype surrounding AI, there is a scarcity of rigorous research that examines the organisational and behavioural factors that foster AI integration in supply chains is lacking. This quantitative study addresses this gap in knowledge by developing a research hypothesis that examines the relationships between supply chain culture and AI. We extend the generalisability of culture to provide novel insights about AI-driven supply chains that have not been reported in previous studies. The findings demonstrate the influential role that cultural enablers have on the successful integration of AI technologies in supply chains, which has implications for operations and supply chain management.},

Research is still evolving towards the development of frameworks linking Industry’s 4.0 enabling technologies to specific goals and to their impact on the manufacturers’ businesses. A systematic review of all peer-reviewed managerial research is performed to extract Industry’s 4.0 enabling technologies, barriers and goals. A framework linking technologies, barriers, and goals is then developed together with a web application based on its contents. The use of the framework is demonstrated through its application to two specific empirical case studies. The review shows that there are 9 classes of Industry’s 4.0 enabling technologies, whose different arrangements lead to the achievement of up to 15 business goals that can be thwarted by 21 barriers. The pursuit of these goals leads to three different destinations, i.e. three diverse digital transformations of the manufacturing firms. This paper provides a holistic framework that analyses the relationships among Industry’s 4.0 enabling technologies, barriers and goals. It appeals to managers who can use its contents along with the web application to derive recommendations and suggestions tailored to their Industry’s 4.0 journeys.},

As new concepts, the study finds that distinctive dynamic capabilities are led by a sense of belonging in territorial value-oriented enterprises and collaboration among firms’ stakeholders, who feel as members of an extended family. It also shows that personal capabilities are associated with a gender domain and that digitalization reshapes not only organizational structures but also societal ones.

   abstract = {Digital transformation is here to stay. With the emergence of new digital innovations and diverse and rich data sources, only those organisations that can adapt faster and make better, quicker decisions will become more competitive. Yet, being a first mover is only the start of the transformation process. Organisations need to address and implement digital strategies to manage and sustain a digital transformation in order to stay with, or ahead of, their competition. In this article, we outline some of the key challenges associated with researching digital transformations within the information systems (IS) field and stress the importance of shifting the focus on how digital transformations are managed and sustained. To explore this further, we launched a Special Issue on “Managing and Sustaining Digital Transformations” and received a large volume of submissions. After a series of reviews and revisions, we were delighted to unearth four excellent articles on this important topic. Our hope with this Special Issue is to improve researchers’ abilities to identify the importance of managing and sustaining digital transformations and to encourage them to build on these contributions to better unpack the digital transformation process for the future.},

With the enactment of the Online Access Act (OZG), a law that obliges all federal levels to offer their administrative services digitally in a joint portal network by the end of 2022, a new arena for multilevel collaboration has developed in Germany; the so-called digitalisation labs. The labs are intended to bring together representatives of all federal levels, external actors and citizens to promote problem-oriented policy design and the development of innovative policy solutions. Following a neo-institutionalist perspective and using the analytical concepts of multilevel governance and problem-solving, this paper investigates how the institutional settings, internal dynamics and actors’ composition influence policy design processes in the labs. The empirical analysis is built on a qualitative case study of two digitalisation labs in the policy field ‘Immigration and Emigration', and based on ten expert interviews as well as an extensive document analysis. The paper concludes that, by promoting problem-solving, the institutional settings as well as the organisational design and actors’ constellations have influenced the policy design process in several ways.},

We lack a model of IT adoption during a crisis of extended duration. This paper tackles this gap by looking at the IT-explorative and -exploitative teaching-related practices of university lecturers in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on qualitative data from three European higher education institutions and their responses to the COVID-19 crisis, we propose a process model of IT exploration/exploitation under a condition of extended crisis. The model shows that IT use and practices in response to a prolonged crisis go through phases, presenting predictable challenges that management can alleviate with a well-timed approach.},

   abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive overview of the digital transformation of the fashion industry and describes the opportunities and influences on supply chains, business models, and sustainability-oriented innovations that it offers. Desk research was performed to review emerging cases of companies that engage actively in using 3-dimensional virtual and digital (3DVD) technologies, such as 3D modeling, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), 2- and 3-dimensional (2D/3D) scanning, and digital twinning (DT). The analysis shows how the adoption of digital technologies provides opportunities to dematerialize the traditional fashion supply-chain model of garment production and distribution and maps the innovative shifts occurring in the fashion industry’s processes, products, and services. The adoption of 3DVD technologies by fashion companies unleashes new opportunities with respect to innovation in products/services and optimization of operational processes to streamline activities, shorten the lead time for designing, prototyping, manufacturing, marketing and retailing, and reorganizing the working phases. These capabilities also drive multicentred business-model innovations and thus affect value creation and delivery and capture changes. In addition, the analysis shows that digital transformation affects the four dimensions of sustainability that are interconnected intrinsically across supply-chain processes. Cultural sustainability is paramount, as fashion is a complex cultural system that is able to create products/services that influence the environment, economy, and society. In particular, 3DVD technologies promote cultural transformation of design processes to achieve a remix of skills and open knowledge, a behavioral shift from the consumer perspective in terms of diversity and self-expression, and a change in the organizational culture of companies that drive the digital transformation.},

The examination and synthesis of the theoretical and the empirical articles show that there are direct relations between the three constructs, observing that relations of interaction also represent forms of significant influences on the capacity of the firms to innovate. The literature review conducted in this study opened the possibility to develop a theoretical model that stimulates future research involving effects of interaction between variables associated with innovation, knowledge and IT. Researchers interested in evaluating simultaneous, direct and interaction effects on innovative capability can use the theoretical model developed as the basis for conducting empirical tests. Organisational managers can incorporate the findings of interaction effects into their knowledge management, innovation and IT models. The results show that the literature about knowledge sharing can consider direct impacts and interaction effects, considering their combination with IT infrastructure to enhance companies’ ability to innovate. These findings suggest that companies’ innovative potential can be incremented by efforts to integrate knowledge sharing processes with IT infrastructure components.},

The 2015 Business National Survey database was used. It was found that both productive and intensive uses of broadband encourage labour demand as a reflection of successful innovations' introductions, in the three analysed industries (except for CI's second use). In contrast, the market-oriented uses of broadband reduce the likelihood of hiring staff as corollary of innovative behaviour among the KIBS and CI firms. In addition, among CIs firms, the study found that only the productive uses of broadband -in line with the intrinsic characteristics of its own knowledge base- could promote processes that lead to successful innovation results and positive effects on labour demand to a greater extent than services and KIBS firms. The results highlight the feasibility of stimulating innovation processes and employment through information and communications technology policies among strategic service sub-sectors as creative industries in emerging digital ecosystems.},

The semantic clusters reflect well-known everyday creative domains focused on visual and digital arts, storytelling, and handicraft. Other clusters paid tribute to the role of mind-sets, teams, and imagination, feature business and innovation, and stress the importance of creativity for mental health. In addition, we compared the resulting network to one of #innovation, which had a higher prevalence of technological clusters relating to areas of digital transformation. Both networks are vastly positive, suggesting that the exhibition of potential and success outweighs tweeting about obstacles and failure.

There were 26 key I4.0 nodes that emerged as network hubs. The relative use of I4.0 technology of companies was identified and interconnections between them were measured by network nodes and edges. Temporal analysis was obtained by dividing companies by date of formation. Some of the I4.0 technologies began to appear around 2000. Younger firms were found to have integrated significantly more I4.0 technologies, as expected. The research provides a review of I4.0 technologies by industry that can be used by management to see what competition is doing, and to generate ideas for maintaining or gaining competitive advantage.},

   abstract = {Servitization is a well-recognised phenomenon in the manufacturing industry. Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market.},

Decision quality for staff assignment will affect the organisation efficiency and supply chain resilience. Focusing on realistic needs, this study aims to develop a portfolio decision framework for staff assignment and reorganisation that considers different portfolio effects to enhance logistics and supply chain management functions. In particular, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm for human resource portfolio (HRPNSGA) was developed to derive near-optimal alternatives. For validation, an empirical study was conducted on the reorganisation of the logistics and procurement division for supply chain management in a leading semiconductor manufacturing company. The results have shown practical viability of the proposed framework to generate near-optimal alternatives with better performance for skills matching, work loading balance and capability synergy among the team members of the units for effective reorganisation.},

   abstract = {Despite the benefits of digital technologies (DT) to enhance the performance of the construction industry, the implementation of DT in construction practice has lagged behind. Existing studies have extensively investigated the readiness of single DT, but with limited types of DT and a lack of practicability for construction practitioners. Based on a questionnaire survey, we developed a readiness model and a self-assessment tool for assessing DT readiness for construction companies. Among the 15 indicators of DT readiness surveyed, ‘organizational culture’, ‘leadership and top management support’ and ‘top management’s perception’ were identified as the three most critical indicators. Using factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation approaches, the readiness model incorporates 15 critical indicators within two groups, quantified weightings, membership functions and criticality indices. The self-assessment tool was developed and validated to assess DT readiness for construction companies based on objective weightings, pinpointing where changes are needed in response to technological disruptions and digitalization transformation. This study incorporates both individual and organizational indicators in a novel organizational DT readiness model and provides a self-assessment tool for construction organizations when adopting multiple DT. The research outcomes can assist the decision-making resources for construction companies to plan and monitor their DT adoption process.},

   abstract = {Incorporating decision-makers' risk preferences into data-driven newsvendor models and developing machine learning methods to solve the models are the challenging problems addressed in this study. To consider different distributions and decision-makers' different risk preferences for the two losses of the total cost newsvendor model, the symmetrical, the partial symmetrical and the asymmetrical CVaR criteria are introduced. The regularisation, the primal-dual approach and the kernels in support vector machines are used to transform the data-driven risk-averse newsvendor problems under the CVaR criterion into the convex quadratic programming problems with good theoretical properties. Computational experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset. The models under the partial symmetrical and the asymmetrical CVaR criteria obtained good performances, but that under the symmetrical CVaR criterion suffered the underfitting problem. Two factors including the degrees of risk aversion for the two losses in the total cost newsvendor model and the empirical errors of data-driven models affect order decisions. The degrees of risk aversion for the two losses have anti-directional effects on order quantities. The introduction of asymmetrical CVaR criterion paves a new way to reveal the effects of different risk references for different losses on order decisions, and has the potential to improve newsvendor decisions.},

What are the ideological implications of the latest model-making of Shenzhen? And how does the city’s innovative turn relate to its role as the nation’s perceived civilizational front line? This study explores the continuities and evolution of contemporary Chinese governance by considering the reinvention of the “Shenzhen Model” in relation to processes of urbanization, globalization and industrial upgrading. Drawing upon Tim Oakes’s theory of the “urban” as an ideological device, it examines the (re)making of the “Shenzhen Model” through different discourses, apparatuses and policies related to the city’s technological innovationand entrepreneurship. Situating the “Shenzhen Model” at a time of precarity and uncertainty amidst economic growth slowdown, the China-United States trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic, this article demonstrates how the state mobilizes narratives and practices pertinent to technological innovation and entrepreneurship to enhance its political influence and thus sheds light on the latest developments in urban governance during China’s post-industrial turn.},

In the context of information technology innovation and information systems upgrade, employees’ information security behavior is one of the most crucial elements in the information security management of organizations. Based on the two-dimensional model of challenge−hindrance stressor theory and affective events theory, this study explores the mediating effects of emotions on the relationship between challenge information security stress and ISP compliance. Methods: A field quasi-experimental method was used in this study. Materials include the Challenge Information Security Stress Scale, Information System Security Policy Compliance Scale, and Emotions Scale, which were used to form the two-stage questionnaire surveys. Data of 217 employees from three Chinese companies in Shanghai and Beijing that had passed certifications for information security management system (GB/t22080-2008/ISO/IEC 27001:2005) were collected. Bootstrapping method for multiple mediation models and the Process 3.0 plug-in of SPSS 20.0 were used for data analysis. Results: The findings indicate that challenge information security stress has a positive effect on ISP compliance. Challenge information security stress has a positive effect on positive emotions and a negative effect on negative emotions. Positive emotions have mediating effect between challenge information security stress and ISP compliance, but negative emotions have no mediating effect. Conclusion: The research results expand the research scope of challenging stress in the two-dimensional model of challenge−hindrance stressor theory in the context of organizational information security. The findings reveal the mediating effect of positive emotions in challenge information security stress and ISP compliance relationship, which provides empirical support for the application of positive psychology in the field of management.},

Taking all non-financial Chinese A-share firms from 2010 to 2018 as the research sample, we investigate the impact of Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) on corporate digital transformation. Evidence shows that EPU has a significantly positive impact on corporate digital transformation. This result still holds after a series of robustness tests, such as employing alternative measures of key variables, controlling for various fixed effects, including possibly omitted variables and adopting estimation of instrumental variables in the 2SLS approach. In addition, market competition provides the primary channel through which EPU influences corporate digital transformation. Finally, the above EPU effect is more pronounced in firms with small size, non-SOEs, and firms with weak corporate governance. Overall, our results provide a novel explanation for the behaviour of corporate digital transformation in the emerging capital markets.},

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods electronic survey of UK higher education lecturers, actively teaching pre-registration undergraduate or postgraduate physiotherapy degrees, was conducted between October 2020 and February 2021. Data was converted into proportions with a 95% confidence interval. Likert scale questions were treated as numeric variables with the mean and standard deviation calculated for combined responses. The thematic analysis reported patterns of data extracted from open-ended questions. Results: 96 respondents completed the survey, reporting some positive attributes attached to online learning. 81% (n = 78, 95% CI 72–88) agreed that students developed their digital skills and were able to learn conveniently at their own pace (n = 75, 78%, 95% CI 69–85). However, 62.5% (n = 60, 95% CI 23–72) of respondents felt that students were overall disadvantaged with online learning, with 72% (n = 69, 95% CI 62–80) reporting that online learning was not comparable to face-to-face to teaching. The reasons for perceived student disadvantage were categorised into three themes; 1) a lack of ability in sessions to practice handling techniques, 2) the inability to gauge student understanding and check practical skill competence and 3) the lack of student self-directed practice time. UK physiotherapy lecturers did indicate they would continue to incorporate online learning in the future (n = 84, 87.5%, 95% CI 79–93). Such responses were based on two key themes; an improved work-life balance and the perception that online learning was no more challenging than traditional on-campus delivery. Conclusions: UK physiotherapy lecturers reported that students were disadvantaged with online learning delivery compared to face-to-face teaching. Lecturers indicated a willingness to continue with aspects of online learning across the curriculum, despite suggesting it had a negative impact on students subject understanding.},

We interviewed 25 experts and observed the quality management documentation of seven European manufacturing companies. Results emerged using thematic content analysis and we gained further insights from interviewees, allowing us to propose suggestions garnered from the interviews. The guideline demonstrates how requirements can be integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies such as radiofrequency identification tags, smart sensors, the internet of things, smart human interface, enterprise resource planning modules, artificial intelligence to improve a typical ISO 9001 quality management system. Some issues emerged relating to the fear of losing jobs, validation of quality control equipment based on artificial intelligence, and decision-making and problem-solving processes. The implications of this research are mainly related to the opening of a new debate concerning the integration between ISO 9001 and Industry 4.0 as well as the proposal, to our knowledge, of the first tentative integration.

To inform this debate, this article examines the level of and demand for the protection of data collected from African producers. To this end, the article presents a review of national personal data protection laws in Africa and assesses compliance of digital agricultural service providers with these laws. It also offers a first insight into perceptions on personal data protection among African agricultural producers. The analysis shows that data privacy regulations in Africa have been evolving, but several countries have yet to adopt related legislation. Existing laws generally reflect the basic elements of the 2014 African Union Convention on personal data protection, but often fall short on provisions of particular importance to digital service provision. Compliance with national data privacy laws among digital agricultural service providers is limited, highlighting enforcement challenges. Awareness of data protection issues is low among agricultural producers, as is the ability to control access to their data.},

   abstract = {The current Covid-19 pandemic has impacted tourism industry the hardest and has steered a total standstill in the multibillion industry, causing economic crisis globally. This paper attempts to assess the impacts and management strategies of agritourism in Brunei. Due to the constant evolvement of knowledge and management strategies during this unprecedented time, qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was deemed appropriate for this research. This paper focuses on agritourism farms in Brunei during Covid-19 to study the implication and contingency plans to divert such crises. Findings from this study indicates that strategies employed by the Brunei agritourism farms were (1) the diversification of economic activities towards product innovation and agribusiness expansion to mitigate tourism revenue loss; (2) digital transformation such as, contact tracing app, the introduction of virtual tourism as well as the use of social media to promote agritourism as lower-risk tourism; (3) adaptive human resources strategy by encouraging community capacity building such as upskilling and training of local farmers to stimulate new agritourism skills and establish more future-ready workforce. The strategies adopted by the agritourism farms in Brunei could provide lessons to neighbouring countries and the ASEAN region to prepare for a crisis-resistant agritourism in the future.},

   abstract = {In a previous work, the first two authors proposed a data-driven method that can construct a site-specific multivariate probability density function model for soil properties using sparse, incomplete, and spatially variable site investigation data. The spatial variability was limited to the depth direction (horizontal variability was not considered). This data-driven method is referred to as GPR-MUSIC-X. In the current paper, two improvements with respect to GPR-MUSIC-X are made. First, the one-dimensional spatial variability considered by GPR-MUSIC-X is extended to three-dimensional spatial variability (denoted by GPR-MUSIC-3X). Second, a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) is adopted to learn the cross-correlation (correlation among different soil parameters) behaviour of generic sites in a soil database accounting for site differences (or uniqueness), and the learning outcome is incorporated into GPR-MUSIC-3X. The resulting model is a quasi-site-specific model (denoted by HBM-MUSIC-3X) because it not only is based on site-specific data but also is informed by the soil database in a manner sensitive to site uniqueness. A case history is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed HBM-MUSIC-3X.},

To this end, by employing unique data from a national survey of 1,001 Korean OOH advertising firms, this study examines such firms’ acceptance of digital advertising policy. The results of a hierarchical regression analysis reveal that two key variables—perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use—from the extended technology acceptance model positively influence policy acceptance. The findings also suggest that factors from the technology-organization-environment framework, such as organizational innovativeness and perceived burden of cost in the organizational context, and perceived industry pressure in the environmental context affect policy acceptance. The results of this study demonstrate that the combined model is useful in explaining OOH firms’ decision such as policy acceptance in digital transformation process. The main findings of this study have policy and managerial implications for other countries in digital transformation process.},

While location-based advertising (LBA) has garnered both professional and academic interest, research on the responses of consumers to LBA is still scarce. Moreover, previous studies have not evaluated consumers’ situational factors as reaction constraints to LBA. This study attempts to identify (1) the effect of consumers’ multitasking on the avoidance of LBA, (2) the mediating role of the perceived intrusiveness between consumers’ multitasking and avoidance of LBA, and (3) the moderating roles of location proximity and product durability in the relationship between consumers’ multitasking and avoidance of LBA. Three experiments show that consumers who multitask tend to avoid LBA and perceived intrusiveness mediates consumers’ avoidance of LBA. Furthermore, this study reveals that LBA from close stores and advertising of durable goods increases the perceived intrusiveness and ad avoidance of multitasking consumers. This study contributes to the literature on LBA and suggests new directions for mobile marketers and retailers wanting to use LBA.},

This process is meaningful in that it can reduce the goal ambiguity of the organization and achieve results. In other words, goal setting and optimal alternative selection based on a comprehensive analysis of the situation can achieve government performance. The global achievements in e-government in South Korea and Denmark also follow this initiative. However, the shift from e-government to digital government requires a change in approach to planning. In other words, rather than planning a rational-comprehensive approach to find the optimal solution, it requires a social and political approach or an incrementalism approach with the participation of various stakeholders. This point of view is similar to the study of a regional innovation system that aims to innovate through a network of multiple participants. It is also consistent with the perspective of open innovation, which creates knowledge through internal and external exchanges and breaks down organizational boundaries.},

However, the current extraction technologies and quantification techniques are still lacking in terms of cost validation, high energy consumption, long extraction time, and low yield production. To date, artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist and improvise the bottleneck of fucoxanthin extraction and quantification process by establishing new technologies and processes which involve big data, digitalization, and automation for efficiency fucoxanthin production. This review highlights the application of AI models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), capable of learning patterns and relationships from large datasets, capturing non-linearity, and predicting optimal conditions that significantly impact the fucoxanthin extraction yield. On top of that, combining metaheuristic algorithm such as genetic algorithm (GA) can further improve the parameter space and discovery of optimal conditions of ANN and ANFIS models, which results in high R2 accuracy ranging from 98.28% to 99.60% after optimization. Besides, AI models such as support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and ANN have been leveraged for the quantification of fucoxanthin, either computer vision based on color space of images or regression analysis based on statistical data. The findings are reliable when modeling for the concentration of pigments with high R2 accuracy ranging from 66.0% - 99.2%. This review paper has reviewed the feasibility and potential of AI for the extraction and quantification purposes, which can reduce the cost, accelerate the fucoxanthin yields, and development of fucoxanthin-based products.},

This paper utilizes a meta-analysis method through a review of the literature, data analyses, and inductive reasoning to reach two research propositions: (1) social mediating technologies support the achievement of social entrepreneurship success and social network capabilities, and (2) social mediating technologies and social network capabilities support the realization of social entrepreneurship success. These two propositions have been further validated through industrial data analyses. A conceptual framework has been created and analyzed to portray the research question. The framework has created three constructs, including social mediating technologies, social network capabilities, and social entrepreneurship success.

Thus, this study integrates prior research results to draw up a well-established multi-order construct conceptualisation research framework and to deepen the comprehension of the involvement-resistance-innovativeness behaviour in the ADAS adoption context. Based on the hypotheses, an academic model was developed and tested using a large cross-sectional study of 527 ADAS users from Taiwan, using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that it seems to be suitable to acquire access to innovative behaviour from the consumer resistance viewpoint so as to accomplish greater explanatory power in the three orders adoption models. Numerous barriers, however, still hinder the ADAS's widespread acceptance. Furthermore, the outcomes affirm a meaningful interaction effect of the consumer innovation resistance and were aware of the impetus on actualised innovativeness, and further realised that it substantially reduces the consumers’ eagerness to hunt for hedonist innovativeness and to buy for the social innovativeness, thereby preventing actualised innovativeness. Researchers and practitioners may come to different conclusions and suggest different approaches to combating consumer resistance to digitisation.},

The closure of world heritage properties and performance venues due to the global pandemic has resulted in a global employment crisis and the subsequent departure of many seasoned Cantonese opera artists, inarguably threatening the sustainability of cultural heritage development and disrupting the transmission process. This paper investigates the intertwined relationship between transmission, traumatic crisis, and cultural heritage professionals (CHPs) through the lens of 56 Cantonese opera artists in Hong Kong. Utilising the transactional theory of stress and coping, this paper critically examines the role, psychological responses, and subsequent actions of Cantonese opera artists amid traumatic crisis. The findings contribute to the scholarship on cultural transmission by documenting the impact of social mobilisation, paradigm shifts on tradition, career crisis, vocational behavioural changes, and digital transformation on safeguarding intangible cultural heritage amid trauma. This paper argues that positive coping is related to post-traumatic growth and industrial transformation, highlighting the urgency for Hong Kong and the world to develop preparedness for a road map of cultural heritage transmission to coexist with the pandemic or other traumatic crises in this age of global challenges.},

The historical developments of geotechnical risk and reliability are reviewed for the past six decades. The key features distinguishing geotechnical and structural engineering are the natural origin of the ground and the lack of sufficient data to characterize the ground using the more familiar frequentist interpretation of probability. For the first feature, random field theory is applied to model spatial variability and the random finite element method or other methods are proposed for solving soil-structure interaction problems in spatially variable soil. For the second feature, compilation of databases is essential to serve as priors for Bayesian updating and more recently for Bayesian machine learning. There is a gradual evolution towards reliability-based design because probabilistic methods offer a pathway to address big data and implement data-centric geotechnics as one step towards digital transformation. Given the complexity of the natural ground (known unknowns can be large and there are unknown unknowns), engineering judgment remains important to bridge the gap between theory and practice. However, the role of engineering judgment needs to be updated as modern machine learning methods become more powerful.},

Most newspapers expanded their digital offerings, erecting paywalls since 2011. However, little is known about local newspapers’ paywall results. To extend media economics research on digital news consumption and to assess the influence and practicality of the disruption theory in the context of the newspaper business, this study systematically examines consumer demand for 50 major U.S. newspapers’ multiplatform products through analyzing their circulation and pricing data. Results reveal that they charged digital subscribers a fraction of the print subscription price, but digital subscribership remained small, contributing only 3% of total reader revenue. Digital performance as weak as such raises concerns about the viability of digital subscriptions as a revenue source, provides support for the “online news as an inferior good” thesis, and calls for a reassessment of self-disruption as a practical strategy for newspaper firms.},

However, circulation data are often reported out of context, resulting in misinterpretations of reader preference and misinformed strategy. To accurately assess demand for print newspapers, this study examines the price of 25 widely-circulated U.S. newspapers in 2008, 2012, and 2016. The analysis documented industry-wide, more-than-substantial price hikes. Seven-day home delivery price more than doubled, and weekday single-copy price tripled. Seven-day subscription now costs $510 a year–print subscribers are paying on average $293 more to have the same newspaper delivered to their doorstep. Despite the increase in price, about two-thirds of print readers remained loyal to a product that has become much more expensive and is considered dying by many. Further analysis on price elasticity of demand indicates that demand for the print product remains inelastic, which explains why so many newspapers implemented price hikes to increase circulation revenue. Nevertheless, the constantly increasing price raises concerns about the sustainability of newspapers’ pricing strategy in the longer term. These concerns and managerial implications are discussed.},

We merge INAPP data with Orbis data covering the period 2010–2014-2018. By applying a Diff-in-Diff methodology, we show that the economic size of the effect of new technologies on productivity and sales is approximately twice as large as the effect on average wages. The positive impact is stronger for small and medium-size firms, even though the effects appear to be concentrated among more mature rather than younger firms and are heterogeneaous along the distributions. Results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity issues.},

   abstract = {The transforming construction agenda argues that digitalization enables better value by addressing coordination challenges. However, this claim poorly articulates how value is constituted, and ignores the problems with digitalization in real-life practices. The paper presents a finer-grained analysis of the value implications of digitalization in a critical discourse, organized in two parts, using the two value creation logics in construction as proposed by Bygballe and Jahre and the concept of “commodification” as proposed by Prudham. Through a critical literature review, the first part argues that digitalization mainly supports “production value creation logic” focussing on the integration of business processes at an organizational level, while creating challenges for “project value creation logic” by hampering mutual adjustment in situated practices. The second part conceives of digitalization as “commodification of information” to expose the complex set of processes causing digitalization to impact differently on the two value creation logics. It reveals that digitalization elevates the digital exchange value of information above its situated use value, and so, it systematically shifts the social and business contexts of coordination. Thus, digitalization shifts what, how, by whom and to whose advantage, value is created and captured, making it a politicized change with implications for management and policy.},

DGUs exist at the center of the state, and adopt a shared orthodoxy, favoring agile, user-centric design, pluralistic procurement, data-driven decision making, horizontal ‘platform’ based solutions and a ‘delivery-first’ ethos. However, DGUs are differentiated in practice by their governance structures and resources, adding notable complexity to this recent machinery of government phenomenon.

This paper introduces a new way to compare digital maturity models through a quantitative framework that is compatible with a wide variety of models. Comparisons are performed in the space of the keywords used to characterize key performance indicators (KPIs) that are reverse engineered from the models. The matches are encoded in a keyword matrix that is used to automatically compute the match level of KPI pairs. The framework has been validated on 13 state-of-the-art maturity models whose analysis resulted in the identification of 451 KPIs characterized using 263 keywords structured according to 12 dimensions and 58 subdimensions.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Power is crucial in influencing the parties’ mutual relations during supply chain transactions. In this context, power can be defined as the ability of a firm, which is in the position of buyer or seller, to influence the behaviors and decisions of the other party or to move them in line with their wishes. In some cases, the power may lie with the commercial buyer and, in some cases, with the seller. The characteristics of the sector usually shape this position. In addition, power itself is classified as coercive and non-coercive power according to how it is exercised. Coercive power directs the other party to the target behaviors with imposition and punishments. Non-coercive power, on the other hand, directs the target behaviors by using rewards and creating attraction points. According to the resource dependency theory, companies with coercive power are usually the leading companies due to having vital resources for other stakeholders in the supply chain. Studies have shown that non-coercive power should also be considered an essential factor in terms of maintaining the relationship in the long term. However, no study has been found on the effect of non-coercive power and the coercive power of the companies that are in a strong position in making the supplier selection decision of the buyers at the beginning. As a reason for this, it can be shown that the coverage of non-coercive power elements in the literature is insufficient, and some of them are used as coercive power elements. In this sense, it is suggested for the first time that the concept of soft power, generally used in the literature to explain power relations among countries or organizations, should be included in the analysis to explain power relations within the supply chain. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effect of soft power, including non-coercive power factors, in buyer-seller relations and to determine whether the soft power elements differentiate the supplier selection decisions of the buyers. Methodology: The decision problem discussed in the study is considered a multi-criteria decision-making problem since many factors are influential in evaluating alternatives, and the solution is conducted with multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Accordingly, soft power factors constitute the effective criteria in the decision problem. Suppliers are the alternatives in the decision problem. As a result of the literature review and subsequent expert comments, eight soft power factors were identified as the criteria for evaluating alternatives in the decision problem: culture (CU), values (VA), policies (PL), image (IMG), knowledge sharing (KS), expert power (EXP), reference power (RFP), and agenda setting (AS). The smartphone and accessories sector, where suppliers hold power, is the sector to be implemented. The data were obtained from Eskişehir, Turkey. The choice of the province was influenced by the city having three universities, and the market being relatively large by national standards. With the sector research, 15 big buyer companies were determined. These buyer companies constitute the decision makers in the decision problem. The data required to solve the problem were obtained from the decision-makers to be evaluated by DEMATEL and Fermatean Fuzzy (FFS) WASPAS techniques. For this purpose, original questionnaires specific to DEMATEL and Fermatean Fuzzy (FFS) WASPAS techniques were applied to senior purchasing managers of buyer companies, and data to be analyzed were collected. It was determined that 13 questionnaires were valid for analysis. In the first stage of the problem’s solution, 13 questionnaires were analyzed by applying the steps of the DEMATEL technique, and the weights of the criteria (soft power elements) were determined as a result. To determine the best alternative (supplier) by applying the Fermatean Fuzzy (FF) WASPAS technique to the decision problem, the suppliers that all buyers work with were taken into account, and non-partner suppliers were excluded from the analysis. As a result, three important supplier companies were determined out of the five big buyer companies worked with. Accordingly, in the second stage of the solution of the problem, five experts (decision makers in the role of the buyer) evaluated three big suppliers (alternatives) according to 8 soft power factors (criteria) using a questionnaire developed for the application of the Fermatean Fuzzy (FF) WASPAS method. Findings: According to the findings obtained from the DEMATEL analysis, the PL criterion is the most critical soft power factor with the 14% weight value, CU with 13%, VL with 13%, and RFP has stood out as other important criteria with its 13% weight value. On the other hand, IMG, which has the smallest value (6.13) according to the D values found by DEMATEL analysis, is the criterion most affected by other criteria. However, the EXP with the highest D-R value is generally considered the criterion whose interaction with other criteria significantly impacts the system. In the second stage, using the FF-WASPAS method, the suppliers were ranked as A3>A1>A2. Accordingly, when the three largest suppliers are evaluated according to their soft power characteristics, it is clear that they differ in the eyes of the buyers. In other words, soft power factors influence buyers’ supplier selection. In addition, the results of the validation and sensitivity analysis at the last stage showed no change in the ranking of the alternatives. Research Implications: The techniques applied in the study are effective in solving the decision problem discussed. In this sense, the most influential factors of soft power can be determined with the DEMATEL technique and the interactions between these criteria. In addition, the FFS-WASPAS technique has proven helpful for the analysis and consistency of the decisions made. It is consistent because the obtained supplier ranking did not change as shown by validity and sensitivity analyses. The overall results and consistency of the analyses show that the integrated application of DEMATEL and FF-WASPAS is a suitable method to explain soft power criteria and determine whether suppliers have changed among buyers. On the other hand, the interrelationships between the criteria strengthen our understanding of the formation of total soft power. Finally, resource dependency theory helps interpret and clarify the results, significantly improving our understanding of the phenomenon. Practical Implications: The research findings highlight many vital points that will benefit practitioners in real life. Accordingly, the fact that the most critical power factor is policies shows that the policies created by powerful suppliers will also be followed by the buyers they interact with. Thus, managers should determine their policies by considering the benefits of their relevant stakeholders. According to the resource dependency theory, it is accepted that policies are one of the most fundamental elements of soft power. Furthermore, EXP’s effect on other factors indicates that the historical relations and contacts of the suppliers with the buyer companies enhance creating an attractive atmosphere in bilateral partnerships. Another important inference can be drawn from the IMG. The fact that IMG is the most affected criterion shows how complex it is to shape IMG. Therefore, it is vital to understand how IMG distinguishes a supplier from its competitors in the eyes of buyers in terms of its relationship with other soft power aspects. Originality: This study offers original and distinctive contributions from various angles. For the first time in the literature, the concept of soft power contributes to the concept of non-coercive power in a broader context. Second, the integrated DEMATEL and FFS-WASPAS technique was used for the first time in research evaluating power relations in the supply chain. In addition, research findings will shed light on improvements in research and practice regarding the novel contributions.},

   abstract = {Welfare state bureaucracies the world over have adopted far-reaching digitalisation reforms in recent years. From the deployment of AI in service management, to the ‘opening up’ of administrative datasets, digitalisation initiatives have uprooted established modes of public sector organisation and administration. And, as this paper suggests, they have also fundamentally transformed the political economy of the welfare state. Through a case study of Danish reforms between 2002 and 2019, the analysis finds that public sector digitalisation has entailed the transfer of responsibility for key infrastructure to private actors. Reforms in Denmark have not only been pursued in the name of public sector improvement and efficiency. A principal objective of public sector digitalisation has rather been the growth of Denmark’s nascent digital technology industries as part of the state’s wider export-led growth strategy, adopted in response to functional pressures on the welfare state model. The attempt to deliver fiscal stability in this way has, paradoxically, produced retrenchment of critical assets and capabilities. The paper’s findings hold important implications for states embarking on public sector digitalisation reforms, as well as possibilities for future research on how states can harness technological progress in the interests of citizens–without hollowing out in the process.},

A diversity of technology applications is unilaterally emerging in all food chains with benefits realized through human acceptance and adoption in business processes. This paper focuses on Australia but the lessons apply to digital agriculture globally. We propose that sustainable food systems frameworks identify the relation of individual changes to broader systemic change, to relate individual changes to one another and to understand how multiple changes within a system can trigger major shifts in entire agri-food chains. With this rapidly-changing landscape in mind, we argue that food system frameworks cover five domains: production, market, capitals, governance and data technologies. We analyse experience from agricultural systems, compare it to digitization in non-agricultural systems and conclude that change will be both disruptive and cumulative. We consider the role of systems governance to be under-reported. Governance will prove critical in areas of IP legislation, policy harmonization and targeted investment.},

Given the inefficiencies and biases of traditional manual, static and qualitative risk management practices, research has progressed to using data analytics to objectively and dynamically manage risks. However, the variety of operational risks, techniques and objectives researched is not well mapped across industries. This paper thoroughly reviews the emerging research area applying data analytics to operational risk management (ORM) within financial services (FS) and energy and natural resources (ENR). A systematic literature search resulted in 2,538 publications, from which detailed bibliometric and content analyses are performed on 191 studies of relevance. The literature is classified using a novel multi-layered framework, informing critical analyses of the analytics techniques and data employed. Five core themes emerge, relevant to practitioners, researchers, educators and students across any sector: risk identification, causal factors, risk quantification, risk prediction and risk decision-making. Generally, ENR studies focus on identifying causal factors and predicting specific incidents, whereas FS applications are more mature surrounding risk quantification. To conclude, the comprehensive review reveals areas where further research is needed to advance ORM within and beyond FS and ENR, in pursuit of improved decision-making.},

A literature review was undertaken examining the current state of business excellence models, and their content and use worldwide, including the identification of the key concepts that drive their development and implementation. In this paper, we do present a framework that was validated by a worldwide experts’ panel in Organisational Excellence, taking into consideration the unique characteristics of SME and its industry contexts. It is hoped that the model will allow these enterprises to strive towards organisational excellence using a framework that better fits to their context and needs.},

The study of digital literacies and digital cultures is mostly focused on youth, thus paying limited attention to older adults’ engagement with the web. With this paper, we aim to contribute to under-theorised debates of older adults’ digital experiences beyond generalisations of generational and/or digital divides. Focus groups interviews with older adults enrolled in sessions on digital literacies were used to get insight into this cohort’s online experiences. The findings revealed that older adults’ key motivation to become digitally literate was driven by a desire of remaining relevant in a contemporary world, in other words, of cultivating their identity as active citizens in a digital society. We offer considerations and reflections on the findings through the application of the works of Karl Mannheim to the phenomenon investigated.},

In the decade pre COVID libraries saw a growing number of visits, despite the increasing availability of material digitally. The first part of the article offers an analysis of the factors driving this growth, such as changing pedagogies, diversification in the student body, new technologies plus tighter estates management. Barriers to change such as academic staff readiness, cost, and slow decision making are also presented. Then, the main body of the article discusses emerging factors which are likely to further shape the use of library space, namely: concerns with student well-being; sustainability; equality, diversity and inclusion, and colonization; increasing co-design with students; and new technologies. A final model captures the inter-related factors shaping use and design of library space post COVID.},

In this article, we contribute to deepening the academic conversation about the adaptation of AL at the undergraduate level. Building upon our own personal experiences as teachers and insider researchers we analyse 53 learning diaries of undergraduate students. First, we present the tensions and contradictions that have arisen from using AL in a traditional educational environment with students having less professional experience compared to postgraduate students. Second, we uncovered that students used the flexible framework of AL to solve problems related to roles where they are underprivileged (e.g. the post-adolescent child, the overladen student and the precarious worker). Lastly, we discuss AL flexibility from the aspect of COVID 19, presenting the impact of adapting AL to a digital learning environment and how it has helped to cope with the wicked problems evoked due to the crisis situation. These findings touch upon the emancipatory potential of AL for less-experienced students.},

   abstract = {The current review overview attempts to create order in the overall fragmented scenario regarding output on organizational change management. Grounded on 39 selected reviews out of 113 identified, the manuscript creates a theoretical summary of knowledge and allows change determinants to emerge. Whereas the existing literature refers to a theory or an implementation model and then introduces the analysis of several patchy variables, the proposed organizational change taxonomy refines well-established models by introducing the study of nine thematic groups containing a total of 41 variables. The strategic and behavioral change variables are classified according to the role (antecedent, moderator, mediator, outcome), the direction (positive, negative) and level (micro, meso, macro) of the change phenomenon. This summary clarifying change characteristics and intrinsic complexity suggests directions for future empirical studies and practical tools for managers to design organizational change management architecture with implementation success. MAD statement Since research on change management proceeds at a dizzying pace, it is useful to periodically take stock of the situation on the state of the art. This review provides an updated overview on the current organizational change management scenario. While the manuscript presents a renewed framework, it also suggests a research agenda with new possible ways to further study the field.},

However, there is currently a lack of research examining the effects of multi-level challenges on talent management (TM) and their on-going changes within the post-pandemic context in the Vietnamese banking industry. This research’s objective is to address this gap by exploring the challenges faced by TM practices in the banking industry with the consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic’s influences. The study used a qualitative approach and purposive sampling method with 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with bank managers from various types of banks. Saturation was achieved in 17 interviews. For better robustness, 3 further interviews were conducted, where similarly, no emergent themes were revealed. Thematic analysis was afterwards employed to examine interview data. The findings revealed different multi-level challenges for TM, including talent mobility, digital transformation, competition for talent between banks, changing customer demands, limited resources, and individual talent expectations. This research would contribute to the theoretical development of TM and contextual impacts on TM, and pave the way for comparison with similar industries in terms of TM related issues.},

   abstract = {The ongoing digital revolution is transforming economic production systems as well as our daily lives. If the expectancies in terms of innovation and opportunities are very high on the supply side, little is known about the effective uses of digital tools by customers and the impact on them and their consumption patterns, especially in a situation of mobility. Tourism for example has been tremendously impacted by the digital transformation. It has changed the way people plan, book and travel, but also the way the stakeholders communicate on their destination. But it is also expected that mobile and wireless technologies change the tourist experience of the destination. Mobile devices could induce change in tourist behaviour at the last minute in situ. By using an analysis in terms of services, we suggest that suppliers and tourists in territories coproduce M-tourism services. These services depend on the tourist behaviour but also on the supply, which is available in the destination. Drawing on a survey conducted on the Champs Elysées in Paris in 2018, this paper analyses how different types of people (tourists, residents, workers, etc.) are using these digital services.},

Our research framework derives strategic drivers from a tripod model that integrates the resource-based, the institution-based, and the industry-based views. We use two longitudinal case studies at global automotive suppliers’ Hungarian subsidiaries. We found that each view highlights a different set of strategic drivers. DT in the subsidiaries is boosted by proactive local management and mature process improvement routines (dynamic capabilities); parent–pull relation (internal institutions) and state support attracting manufacturing FDI (external institutions); as well as buyers’ increasing expectations and supplier-related factors (industry-based view). By combining these views, we claim that drivers related to the external institutional context and the industrial competition are usually filtered by the global management before contributing to resource adjustments at subsidiaries in a coercive top-down manner. Despite this seemingly deterministic DT process, local managements can actively shape DT, even that of the MNE.},

Even though readiness and maturity assessment of smartness and sustainability concepts are nested, no study simultaneously focuses on these concepts. As pioneering research, we propose a novel model titled “Smart and Sustainable Supply chain Readiness and Maturity model (S3RM)” and validate it by conducting a case study in the automotive industry. We design our model upon the triple-bottom-line (TBL) approach consisting of smartness and sustainability dimensions. Our study introduces the TBL of smartness covering availability, integrity, and adaptability sub-dimension. TBL of sustainability includes social, environmental, and economic sub-dimensions. The proposed model calculates the Smart and Sustainable Readiness and Maturity Index by averaging sustainability scores’ summation and smartness scores’ multiplication. Each sub-dimension consists of items measured by a readiness and maturity scale. The findings suggest how smartness and sustainability items create strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the supply chain operations. Our model provides managerial implications in assessing the readiness and maturity of Industry 4.0 tools and sustainability indicators. This study offers a road map to managers on smart and sustainable supply chains’ defined target areas.},

The objective of this paper is to offer a definition of PHI considering themes and technologies that make healthcare participatory. We searched Pubmed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, EMBASE, and conference proceedings for articles that reported about use of information technology or informatics in the context of PHI. We performed qualitative synthesis and reported summary statistics. 39 studies were eligible after screening 382 titles and abstracts and reviewing 82 full texts. The top 5 person-centered key themes related to PHI included empowerment, decision-making, informed patient, collaboration, and disease management. Finally, we propose to define PHI as multidisciplinary field that uses information technology as provided through the web, smartphones, or wearables to increase participation of individuals in their care process and to enable them in self-care and shared decision-making. Goals to be achieved through PHI include maintaining health and well-being; improving the healthcare system and health outcomes; sharing experiences; achieving life goals; and self-education.},

The article is one of HERD’s most downloaded articles and continues to be highly cited over a decade later. However, since this article was published, there have been significant global and other changes that have impacted on higher education. Much complexity, change and ambiguity challenge the sector, including through: widening participation and increased student diversity; increasing accountability; the growth of transnational education; digital transformation; the rise of data analytics; evolving assessment philosophy and practice; work-integrated learning; the students as partners movement; the trend away from solo teaching; and new pedagogies for an unknown future. These shifts have taken place in a broader context of profound global changes including: changing economic powers and global political tensions; prevailing societal inequalities; climate change and the resulting environmental and ecological damage that puts human existence at risk; and significantly changing social norms. The global pandemic has contributed a further layer of chaos and uncertainty, including in terms of the meaning of effective higher education teaching. The article argues that given this new context, the criteria that have so successfully defined effective teaching to date now need to be re-interrogated, reconsidered, revised, and updated.},

   abstract = {The term ‘smart city’ has become synonymous with a technologically cultivated utopia, where urban problems can be solved computationally. This approach to urban development has been promoted as a method of enabling city administrations to become more proactive when dealing with issues including pollution, traffic flow and congestion, public safety, energy use, and urban planning. This trend towards using technology in urban management and planning has sparked research and development initiatives across the planet. In the UK, the #PlanTech trend is a governmental initiative that aims to improve engagement between various actors in the planning system, including local authorities and central government, with tech start-ups and digital entrepreneurs who can design solutions to the problems currently experienced by planners, developers, and citizens alike. Despite the significant opportunities that technologies offer city council planning departments in terms of productivity, existing governance models can be shown to represent a significant obstacle to implementation. This paper uses case study research conducted at two English city councils–Coventry and Leeds–to examine the implications of planning reforms and digital transformation of public services on urban planning governance. Utilizing the information gained from a combination of semi-structured interviews and stakeholder engagement exercises, it examines the growing emphasis on technology in planning practice within the public sector and discusses the potential implications that it may have for current governance arrangements. Finally, it suggests what a framework for future urban planning governance within an English political context, in the era of the smart city might require. The paper overall offers a critical view of how current urban planning practice and governance procedures are being quickly subsumed by digital technologies which offer novel and effective methods for professional planners yet are undermined, or are inhibited, by current governance arrangements.},

As the adaptation of existing IT artefacts to new regulations can be expensive and arduous, a more attractive approach would be to design IT artefacts lawfully from the beginning. A major challenge is that the law is generally technology-neutral, and lawful design requires legal expertise throughout the development, which is costly and time consuming due to communication challenges between legal experts and developers. One possible approach to proactively consider IT regulations in the systems development is design patterns that convey legal design knowledge and support developers in determining the appropriate design options. Consequently, we develop a framework for lawful design patterns and demonstrate their feasibility and advantages using the example of developing AI-based assistants and the regulation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Using the design pattern framework, we develop design patterns for lawful AI-based assistants and evaluate them using (a) an experimental approach to show the usefulness of the patterns for developers and (b) rely on a legal simulation study to holistically evaluate how design patterns contribute to lawful IT.},

Handling agents link the two: they receive freight from truckers, consolidate it and forward it to the airlines and vice versa. They need to organise and execute processes efficiently. Digitalisation offers great potential in this context. Furthermore, handling agents’ workers handle most of the freight manually. The resulting elevated levels of physical strain make workers prone to muscular-skeletal disorders. Based on a case study at two handling agents, we first investigate the handling agents’ process chain from an economic perspective. We identify shortcomings and present countermeasures with an emphasis on digitalisation. Second, we analyse the physical strain on the workers and evaluate devices that could improve ergonomics.

Unsurprisingly, debates over a possible U.S.–China power transition highlight China’s rise as a science and technology superpower. These discussions overwhelmingly center on national innovation capabilities, reflective of the bias in assessments of scientific and technological capabilities toward the generation of novel advances. This paper argues that these assessments should, instead, place greater weight on a state’s capacity to diffuse, or widely adopt, innovations. Specifically, when there is a significant gap between a rising power’s innovation capacity and its diffusion capacity, relying solely on the former results in misleading appraisals of its potential to sustain economic growth in the long run. I demonstrate this with two historical cases: the U.S. in the Second Industrial Revolution and the Soviet Union in the early postwar period. Lastly, I show that, in contrast to assessments based on innovation capacity, a diffusion-centric approach reveals that China is far from being a science and technology superpower.},

This study contributes to the understanding of how states plan to govern AI with respect to the role they assume and to the way they develop AI in a responsible manner. In different policy instruments across 22 countries plus the European Union, there is considerable variation in how governments approach the governance of AI, both regarding the policy measures proposed and their focus on public responsibility. Analysing a set of policy instruments we find multiple modes of AI governance, with the major difference being between self-regulation-promoting and market-based approaches, and a combination of entrepreneurial and regulatory governance approaches. Our analysis also indicates that the approach to public responsibility is largely independent of the chosen policy mix of AI governance. Therefore, responsibility seems to be a cross-cutting issue that cannot be tied to a specific approach of states towards technology.},

   abstract = {There is a certain degree of technological determinism in the discourse on information and communication technology (ICT) in education. Technological determinism is the relationship between the technical and the social, in this case, technological development taking place outside the socio-economic realities of societies. Hence, the discourse on pedagogical ICT integration has often been concentrated through utopian perspectives driven by personal interests and regulated by service providers. Consequently, the adoption of ICT tools for teaching and learning has been very low despite the huge investments being made by governments. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate teachers’ self-efficacy, perception, attitude, and behavioural intentions to use ICT in the classroom for teaching and learning. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire and the responses of 1050 teachers were analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis. The major finding was that for a wide range of teachers located in various parts of the country, the integration of ICT in the classroom is not dependent on the level of access because only 35 per cent of the 80 per cent of teachers with access to computing infrastructure are using ICT as a teaching assistant tool. Hence, understanding the interplay between teachers’ acceptance of ICT and behavioural intention is important to develop intervention programmes and timely professional development opportunities.},

The pace of technology-driven changes creates significant challenges for the alignment between the skill needs of industry and provision by higher education. Drawing on concepts from neo-correspondence theory, we examine the emergence of the FinTech sector. We present data from two structured interviews with 28 employers based in Ireland. What emerges from this study, is that the type and level of skills required by industry is changing faster than ever before. The level of competence required in hard skills is decreasing, as in-house training and continuous professional development requirements increase. However, there is a greater expectation that graduates will have advanced soft skills. Skill shortages exist, not because of poor industry-higher education relationships but because of a lack of understanding of employers’ perceptions, preferences, and expectations.},

   abstract = {For centuries, humans’ capacity to capture and depict physical space has played a central role in industrial and societal development. However, the digital revolution and the emergence of networked devices and services accelerate geospatial capture, coordination, and intelligence in unprecedented ways. Underlying the digital transformation of industry and society is the fusion of the physical and digital worlds–‘perceptality’–where geospatial perception and reality merge. This paper analyzes the myriad forces that are driving perceptality and the future of geospatial intelligence and presents real-world implications and examples of its industrial application. Applications of sensors, robotics, cameras, machine learning, encryption, cloud computing and other software, and hardware intelligence are converging, enabling new ways for organizations and their equipment to perceive and capture reality. Meanwhile, demands for performance, reliability, and security are pushing compute ‘to the edge’ where real-time processing and coordination are vital. Big data place new restraints on economics, as pressures abound to actually use these data, both in real-time and for longer term strategic analysis and decision-making. These challenges require orchestration between information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) and synchronization of diverse systems, data-sets, devices, environments, workflows, and people.},

Cyberspace has completely revolutionised our ways of life, disrupted our economies, and allowed for important progress in our societies. But the advantages of the digital revolution are now threatened by the use of cyberspace for war purposes. This article explores the states' security dilemma as they face cyber challenges and the ambivalence of the notion of security in cyberspace. It highlights how, in ten years, cyberspace has become a battlefield and a strategic priority for many states that have represented it as a geopolitical threat for their national security, hence justifying its progressive militarisation. Meanwhile, they have become cognizant to the systemic risk of proliferation of offensive cybertools and cyber-operations. This security dilemma – one that opposes a representation of cyber threats as a geopolitical risk to that of cyberspace as a systemic risk – is at the heart of the multilateral negotiations on the regulation of cyberspace. There, a multiplicity of non-state actors has forced their way to the table through a multitude of initiatives that emphasize the importance of the challenges at stake and how difficult it will be for the states to face them.</span>},

Evidence suggests that teacher well-being can benefit from tailor-made intervention programmes. Thus, scientifically tested well-being programmes are of great interest for individual teachers (e.g. from a self-help perspective) as well as for school administrators and policy makers (e.g. to offer systemic support). The present paper provides a review of 29 peer-reviewed research papers that focus on interventions fostering well-being in teachers. The results show that a wide range of interventions and measurement approaches have been used and reported. Critically, few studies have used a rigorous methodological approach. On the basis of the review, it can be concluded that the field is still in its formation phase. Interventions as well as the scientific study of such interventions are quite novel in this context. Therefore, four major recommendations for advancing the scientific study of teacher well-being interventions are proposed, including conceptual advances and developments in the design, dissimination and study of interventions.},

   abstract = {changes based on changed living arrangements that were followed by new saving and spending patterns. Daily life was newly defined through scheduled working hours and emerging labour laws; commercial asset investments contributed to the development of accounting and finance practices. According to Wisskirchen, Biacabe, Bormann, Muntz, Niehaus, Soler, and von Brauchitsch (2017), digitalisation with the emergence of the internet and a new era of access to information beginning in the 1970s contributed to extended use of industrial machines. Industry 4.0, or the fourth Industrial Revolution, is defined through cyber-physical systems (CPS)-the extended integration of technology and the communication between everyday objects (the internet of things)-and shapes a new world order of permanently (inter)connected humans and machines. Hence, Dirican (2015) raised the question of how the emergence of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) aggravated economic and labour market development not only on a societal and organisational level, but also on an individual basis. Discussing the history of "robotics", Murphy et al. (2017) state that science fiction authors and later movie producers have had an interest in non-human beings since the early 1900s. Despite the commonly grim outlook of humanoids replacing life on Earth in most stories, robotic applications are an integral part of our daily lives, not only in our homes, but also in transportation, entertainment, law enforcement, armed forces, and health care. Technological advancements in the hospitality industry Even though for some the hospitality industry is still associated with long working hours, low salary levels and exploitation of minorities, the industry has come a long way since Orwell famously criticised and labelled hospitality-related workers as having no social significance in the 1930s (Baum, 2019). In the age of big data, the hospitality industry, a sector within the broader services industry, has adopted computerised processes and artificial intelligence in, for example, property management systems (PMS), revenue management systems (RMS), or customer relationship management (CRM), to synthesise key performance indicators (Mariani, Baggio, Fuchs, & Höepken, 2018). Smart home appliances and applications such as Alexa by Amazon, Siri by Apple, and the Google Assistant have found their way into hotel rooms to control the ambiance, provide information, order services or communicate complaints. Robotic appliances are not only utilised for programmable housekeeping purposes and assisting lobby attendants, concierges and bellboys, but have also been introduced as waiters in restaurants. The owner of a restaurant in China sees robots as not only an opportunity to save costs in the long run by easing the demanding workload of ABSTRACT: Contemporary technological applications are widely in use in the public sector; transportation, law enforcement, armed forces, and health care industries have long adopted robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Our daily lives have been shaped through the digital transformation and, as such, this development has also impacted the hospitality industry. By exploring the practical implications, the authors outline motivations of organisations, and highlight shortcomings due to the current level of technology adoption. In line with this, a trade-off between convenience and limiting freedom of choice is contrasted with varying regional acceptance levels by users. Further, the adoption of advanced technology as far-reaching as social robots has implications on a strategic and human resources level; human-robot interaction (HRI) in a professional setting comes with changing job tasks, and a general-skill-focused human workforce and therefore requires adapted policies and strategies. Undoubtedly, the future is here, and rather than fearing the change the authors recommend using technological advancements and its possibilities through an informed choice.},

First, a systematic literature review across various disciplines provided a comprehensive understanding of agility and its key dimensions. Second, several conceptual frameworks for agility were analyzed and the relevant aspects for strategic communication were synthesized. In the third step, the current impact of organizational agility on corporate communications was explored by conducting empirical in-depth interviews with chief communication officers and senior communication managers from 38 multinational companies. Finally, the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical insights were combined to develop a framework for the role of strategic communication in the context of organizational agility. The findings of this study suggest that communication departments need to: a) adopt their own structures and processes, accordingly; b) enhance organizational agility by enabling other departments; and c) communicate the agile transformation of their organization both internally and externally.},

However, not everyone is willing or able to follow the new, more or less formal requirements digitalisation has brought along. Existing reviews on the intersection between Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and mobility cover a range of vantage points, but the perspective of how various levels of engagement with digital technologies affect access and navigation of transport services has not been addressed yet. In communication science, studying disparities in terms of ICT appropriation and their consequences is known as digital inequality research. This review paper aims at shedding light on what digital inequality in the context of transport services consists of and what its consequences are. To do so, we define and use a conceptual framework for the analysis of digital inequality in transport services. The review of the twenty-five papers, as selected in our systematic literature search, shows that there is a burgeoning interest in this topic. Vulnerability to digitalisation in transport services exists along dimensions of age, income, education, ethnicity, gender and geographical region. We find that motivations and material access get more attention than digital skills and effective usage. Nevertheless, literature acknowledges that having material access to technology does not mean that people benefit from what technology has to offer. Furthermore, the characteristics of ICTs impact one’s possibilities to access digital technologies, such as how user-friendly a technology is. Data-driven and algorithm-based decision-making present a particularly pernicious form of digital exclusion from transport services. As digital technologies are progressively becoming indispensable to navigate the world of transport services, low levels of digital engagement may create a new layer of transport disadvantage, possibly on top of existing ones. Although digitalisation can be part of the solution to transport disadvantage, it can also be part of the problem. With network effects at play, what might start as a relative disadvantage may turn into an absolute disadvantage. Given the nascent state of research on digital inequality in transport services, much remains to be understood. Suggested research avenues include mechanisms of digital exclusion from transport services, the contribution of digital inequality to transport disadvantage, and importantly, solutions to mitigate its impacts.},

The precise quartz sensor utilized for observing cutting forces enabled insights into the cutting mechanism involved while wood disintegration. Cutting velocity evolved as a key process parameter strongly influencing cutting force. Evaluation of uncut chip thickness showed a regression that was strongly influenced by particular force components. The friction force generated by “ploughing” the surface was relevant when cutting thin chips. In contrast, the part of force introduced by chip formation affected the process weightily in the case of cutting a thick chip. When cutting parallel to the grain lower forces were observed than cutting perpendicular to grain orientation. Obtained data supported the mathematical force prediction model establishment involving several parameters (e.g. cutting velocity, cutting fibre angle, uncut chip thickness, and moisture content).},

The study employs Weberian ideal-type methodology and analyzes qualitative data from 12 online focus groups involving 49 academics. The research unveils their perspectives on key organizational culture facets, categorized under: mission, leadership, socialization, information, and strategy. The findings highlight that academics envision an ideal-type university as an institution that nurtures conditions conducive to innovation. Such an institution fosters an organizational culture that champions openness, diversity, creativity, and constructive dialogue, thereby fostering inter- and multidisciplinary collaborations transcending traditional boundaries. Their ideal university model promotes an innovation culture to unlock academic staff potential, fostering capabilities, agency, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurship. Addressing a research gap in the contemporary analysis of the needs and desires of Polish academics this study serves also as a foundational reference for future investigations into the alignment of their vision with the actual landscape, while also generating inquiries and hypotheses to understand variations. By informing decisions, strategies, and practices linked to fostering innovation within higher education institutions, this study tackles the universally recognized challenge of stimulating innovation within academia. Consequently, it offers insights for policy formulation and practical implementation within the realms of higher education and innovation management, extending beyond Poland to broader international contexts grappling with challenges like bureaucracy, excessive regulation, and hierarchical structures.},

There is a paucity of literature regarding 4IR usage in enhancing post-disaster recovery and rehabilitating informal settlements in South Africa. Thus, this study provides a collective insight into pre- and post-disaster reconstruction issues and the role of 4IR technologies.

Findings show that 4IR technology is germane in the 21st-century era and relevant in post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation in informal settlements. Inadequate resources (finance and workforce), damage to major infrastructure systems, absence of a comprehensive supply chain during these periods, lax implementation of post-recovery and rehabilitation for the affected communities, and lax enforcement of planning policies and practices by the government emerged as factors hindering post recovery and rehabilitation. This study will contribute to informing policymakers to develop a platform for monitoring and implementing 4IR technologies in planning existing and future infrastructure delivery in South Africa.},

We analyse the impact of e-government index, e-participation index, and cybersecurity commitment on firms’ performance (enterprise value, book value per share, and cash flow from operation per share) using OLS regression. A structural equation modelling was further employed to explain the mediating role of cybersecurity commitment. Results suggest that e-government has a positive linkage with cybersecurity commitment and performance. However, there is preliminary evidence that cybersecurity measures initiated by e-government will drive performance. The e-participation index has a positive association with cybersecurity commitment and a heterogeneous impact on performance, suggesting the need to differentiate between development and participation. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role of e-government and cybersecurity commitment in boosting the profitability of companies and supporting the influence of the surrounding technological environment on companies’ performance.},

This issue is addressed through an analytical framework that stresses two dimensions: the exploration and exploitation of digitalised QM processes and value creation, which is performed by the customer or in interactions facilitated by the provider. Through a multiple-case study of four large Swedish organisations, we propose six different challenges and corresponding roles for QM. Further, the study identifies challenges of digitalisation affecting both exploitative and explorative practices throughout an organisation’s value creation process. This research contributes to the existing literature with empirical evidence on the challenges induced by digitalisation, an area often discussed but not as often studied empirically.},

   abstract = {This article presents a Swedish study on the potential of technology to transform teaching and learning practices in higher education. Sweden is at the forefront of technological innovation and digitalization and when it comes to technology in education this is not an exception. Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) has emerged as an important pedagogical aspect within higher education in recent years. The term TEL is used to demonstrate teaching experiences that intend to improve such support. Previous research has recognized bottom-up initiatives from academic staff with specialists in technology often addressed by individual enthusiasts. Also, most internal processes regarding digitalization are identified as top-down initiatives driven by policy rather than influenced teachers. Hence, the main aim of this study is to analyse academic teachers´ experiences with digital technologies that support students’ learning in higher education. To support this aim, following research questions are posed: 1) What factors facilitate TEL in teaching in higher education and why? 2) What factors limit TEL in higher education and why? Focus group interviews with 36 academic teachers from two Swedish universities were conducted. Results show that on the one hand teachers experience both benefits and limitations with TEL. On the other hand, important organisational aspects of using TEL are highlighted. The choices that academic teachers face and give expression to do not appear to be a matter of individual choice or stance in teaching situations. These results have relevance globally for all involved in teaching and learning in higher education.},

Data was collected from 394 respondents recruited using Google Forms using the self-selection sample technique. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. According to the findings, ISS model components (information quality, system quality, and service quality) significantly influence user engagement with health and fitness applications. Furthermore, user engagement has a significant and positive influence on user satisfaction and app-love. Furthermore, app satisfaction and app-love positively impact stickiness intention, word-of-mouth, and continuance intention. Moreover, the influence of user satisfaction on WOM and continuance intention is moderated by health consciousness. Additionally, the influence of app-love on stickiness intention, WOM, and continuance intention is moderated by health consciousness.

However, it is unclear how Industry 4.0 technologies can help achieve these different and sometimes competing targets. This study investigates this relationship through a survey of 92 manufacturers. The study employs Exploratory Factor Analysis to define four main technology arrangements based on 18 Industry 4.0 technologies: Vertical Integration, Virtual Manufacturing, Advanced Manufacturing Processing Technologies, and Online Traceability. Then, independent samples tests were conducted to compare the implementation status of these arrangements when manufacturing flexibility, process quality, and productivity are (or are not) pursued as the main production targets. The results show that Vertical Integration is a general-purpose technology arrangement because it supports all targets. On the other hand, Virtual Manufacturing and Online Traceability are specific-purpose arrangements, adopted especially for flexibility and productivity targets, respectively. Advanced Manufacturing Processing Technologies, in turn, is an integrative-purpose technology arrangement since it is adopted when two competing targets are pursued: productivity and manufacturing flexibility. The study ends with a decision model to implement Industry 4.0 based on the production targets a company may pursue. It shows the interconnection and trade-offs between these production targets and the Industry 4.0 technologies adopted.},

Among the four explanatory variables, information sources were the most critical factor in predicting innovation performance. This study provides several implications. First, it contributed to the research of technology forecasting by presenting a machine learning model that can accurately predict ICT innovation performance.

After an introduction of the underlying methodical concept, this paper introduces four selected use cases that were carried out on the basis of U-TEP: two technology-driven applications implemented by users from the remote sensing and software engineering community (generation of cloud-free mosaics, processing of drone data) and two examples related to concrete use scenarios defined by planners and decision makers (data analytics related to global urbanization, monitoring of regional land-use dynamics).

Therefore, the research question is how to reduce the complexity of digital transformation from the point of view of innovation actors for a faster and more effective adaptation of their strategies? To answer that question, this paper conceives digitization as a ‘new technological path’. The complexity of digitization is assumed as the clearest expression of current technological change. The speed, dynamics and strength developed give technological change a character of domination. These characteristics have a transforming power on the actors that form the triple helix. Specifically, the objective of this work is to characterize the dynamism of the theoretical approach to technological change by making a longitudinal analysis of the development of digitization. The theoretical analysis allowed the identification of a set of variables, which modifies the way the actors are organized in triple helix model and can generate new arrangements in the interaction process. Also, it was observed that the variables identified are distinctive from other innovation variables in the approaches of Schumpeterian and neo-Schumpeterian actors. The results of this work were achieved using qualitative analysis through the MAGG methodological approach that made it possible to systematize and classify longitudinally different theoretical perspectives on the dynamics of technological change. A theoretical contrasting method was relevant because it allowed us to identify these variables.},

Further analyses are conducted to establish whether Industry 4.0 digital technologies moderate the association between (a) supply chain integration and supply chain agility and (b) supply chain agility and financial performance. Findings based on the data pertaining to a sample of 274 Swedish manufacturing firms indicate that supply chain agility fully mediates the link between supply chain integration and financial performance. However, while Industry 4.0 digital technologies strengthen the effect of supply chain agility on financial performance, they do not moderate the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain agility. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding how digital technologies play a role in achieving competitive advantage in interplay with dynamic capabilities related to the supply chain.

It is widely considered imperative for SMEs to stay relevant in the digital age. Yet, little is known about the conditions under which SME digitalisation improves the performance of SMEs in the IS literature. Guided by the SME literature, we postulate that the business value of SME digitalisation–based on its impact on improving financial firm performance–is dependent on two factors that are particularly relevant to SMEs due to their smallness and flexibility: radical orientation and organisational rigidity. Using data from multiple waves of surveys in 2019–2020 and archival financial data from Dutch SMEs, we demonstrate that the positive impact of SME digitalisation on performance improvement strongly depends on SME characteristics. SMEs who are oriented towards radical change and are more rigid are disadvantaged and attain lower returns on SME digitalisation.},

The digital milk-run system represents the new frontier to optimize material handling strategies but is still not fully exploited to address material distribution depending on the time slots required by the manufacturing lines. Therefore, to fill this gap, this paper investigates the actual integration of the milk-run system with an IoT system. An analytical model for planning a dynamic routing strategy for tugger trains to deliver the materials to different workstations of a production line has been developed. The proposed model provides a materials distribution consistent with the time slot required by the manufacturing line, ensuring the minimisation of the total distance of the routes. An algorithm developed in Python is proposed to solve the NP-hard problem (nondeterministic polynomial time problem). The model has been applied to a real case of a worldwide automotive company to validate and prove its efficacy and efficiency. Indeed, compared to the current in-plant logistic strategy, (i) the inventory stock of each workstation was ensured, (ii) the average utilization rate of the tugger trains’ fleet was improved, and (iii) the daily path was minimized.},

   abstract = {Today, a myriad of data is generated via connected devices and digital applications. In order to benefit from these data, companies have to develop their capabilities related to big data and analytics (BDA). A critical factor that is often cited concerning the “soft” aspects of BDA is data ownership, i.e., clarifying the fundamental rights and responsibilities for data. IS research has investigated data ownership for operational systems and data warehouses, where the purpose of data processing is known. In the BDA context, defining accountabilities for data is more challenging because data are stored in data lakes and used for previously unknown purposes. Based on four case studies, we identify ownership principles and three distinct types: data, data platform, and data product ownership. Our research answers fundamental questions about how data management changes with BDA and lays the foundation for future research on data and analytics governance.},

The external disturbance and noise need to be estimated and compensated by the feedback control mechanism. However, the autocorrelation structure could mask problem signals and affect the monitoring of the system’s inner health. Without separating the mixed signals, neither the evaluation of inner health nor the compensation of external disturbance can be achieved. A new signal separation approach, fractal component analysis (FCA), is developed to identify the autocorrelation structure for improving the health of the feedback control system.

As such, the question of whether and how smart-city construction can promote the high-quality development of urban economies is worth considering. By measuring the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of 233 cities in China from 2004–2019, this paper adopts the national pilot smart cities of China as a quasi-experiment and constructs a time-varying DID model to explore the direct, dynamic, and heterogeneity influence of smart-city construction on GTFP. The results indicate the following: (1) Smart-city construction can significantly promote the urban GTFP, which is mainly caused by the progress of green technology, and the effect is robust after a series of robustness tests; (2) smart-city construction can contribute to GTFP improvement primarily through accelerating technological innovation, promoting industrial upgrading, and realizing resource allocation optimization; and (3) smart cities that are larger in scale, have a higher administrative rank, and lie in eastern regions have stronger positive effects on GTFP. This study aims to contribute to the promotion of urban sustainable development.},

Students from both institutions, studying at the equivalent level to become future primary education teachers, analysed the way in which primary school textbooks approach the topic of heritage in the Canary Islands and in Mexico. Flipped classrooms and project-based learning were the main teaching methodologies, culminating in a final assignment: a written report by students. The results enable us to re-evaluate the knowledge transmitted through textbooks in the light of this history, and their facilitation in teaching and learning processes, with attention to their epistemological biases. Several topics were highlighted as core concerns in the use of textbooks for teaching heritage: the need to question the role of the textbook in the teaching process, and the importance of Indigenous heritage when teaching and holistic concept of heritage. In outlining the inter-university teaching project, the article also shows how the analysis of textbooks in both contexts, and their subsequent comparison, has made possible a reformulation of how students of education in the Canary Islands and Mexico are taught to teach history.},

Heterogeneity analysis shows that in state-owned enterprises and in those enterprises integrating coal and electricity, a high proportion of clean energy installed capacity and a high level of profitability result in greater improvements. The mechanism test shows that enterprise digital transformation changes factor preference and marginal output, significantly promotes factor-biased technological progress, and saves costs on expensive factors such as energy, thus improving CTFP.

The study was based on the main tactical areas of a PSS business model which was applied to MBB’s possible integration of their equipment (called Fleetboard) in a smart PSS solution. The findings demonstrate that the internal culture of a product-centric automotive manufacturing firm can prohibit the sales of services, even when service technologies are available. On the other hand, financial pressures can create the sense of urgency required for the firm to appreciate the necessity of change. The process of change is too complex, since it requires capabilities in key areas such as the law, marketing, networking/partnerships, design, sustainability, and organisation and human resources management.

However, the organisational perspective to constantly stay up-to-date with technological innovations can become strenuous on an individual level due to the need to constantly adapt to the demands of a permanently changing technological environment. Based on a large-scale online survey of employees in Germany (N = 1,115), we investigated the positive and negative effects of an organisational climate of innovation from a digital stress perspective. Our results indicate that an organisational climate of innovation creates uncertainty in individuals as it supports technological change but can also help to reduce the perception of technological unreliability as it fosters an environment of mutual support. This research, therefore, adds to the idea of a pronounced innovation climate as a double-edged sword and shows that permanently pushing technological innovation should also be viewed in the light of its potential side effects. It follows that innovation initiatives should balance organisational and individual requirements to stay, or become, more competitive, thereby explicitly considering the side effects that too much and/or too fast innovation may have on users.},

This research note attempts to conduct a preliminary analysis on the experiment and discusses its implications for future actions in the development of parliamentary tools and services using AI-based technologies. Analysis is dedicated to intra-parliamentary workspace, while considering possible effects on the main functions of parliament such as law-making and oversight. The note aims to spark the discussion around the implementation strategy, but also for the regulation of such systems in the parliamentary environment.},

   abstract = {Work-integrated learning (WIL) placements, undertaken as part of a higher education qualification, are  recognised as a key opportunity for developing talent that is future-capable and can meet contemporary labour market demands. A workplace supervisor that can facilitate this learning is critical to the experience. The purpose of this study was to explore workplace supervisors’ views on their contributions as educators, and their role as facilitators for the transfer of skills and knowledge from university to the workplace. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 24 WIL host supervisors of students from Business, Sociology and Sports and Recreation in three universities across Australia and New Zealand. The findings confirm WIL supervisors do consider themselves as educators, moving beyond training students on how to complete tasks, to helping them develop the graduate capabilities needed for contemporary work. Further, they consider some skills to be transferable, rather than context-specific and particular to certain industries or workplace cultures. Yet, views on who should be responsible for transfer were mixed with disparities between the higher education curriculum and workplace tasks considered problematic. Key strategies and behaviours for facilitating transfer are identified to help workplace supervisors and educators create appropriate WIL experiences that integrate university and workplace learning.},

The first is to measure the operational efficiency gain that adopting new advanced technologies, defined as the fourth industrial revolution allows firms to achieve. The second is to challenge whether Industry 4.0 investments bring about strong enough improvement in firm performance to address the historical regional development gaps in Italy. Using a sample of 2609 firms observed during the period 2016–2019, we estimate technical efficiency scores by applying a one–step stochastic frontier analysis. This technique allows us to simultaneously relate operating performance to a set of regional dummy variables and assess the Industry 4.0 investment share of total firm investment expenditure. The stylised facts indicate substantial efficiency disparities between smart factories and firms that do not implement such investments. The adoption of new technologies partially mitigates the Italian regional efficiency gap, bridging the distance between Southern Italy and the rest of Italy.},

Ensuring ethical decision-making is essential as eldercare becomes more digital; each decision affects a patient’s life, self-esteem, health and wellness. Methods: We conducted a survey and interviews with eldercare professionals to better understand the behavioural ethics and decision making involved in the digital transition of eldercare. Conclusion: Our qualitative analysis showed three recurrent roles among eldercare professionals in regard to digital service transformation; makers, implementers and maintainers. All three encountered challenging and stressful ethical dilemmas due to uncertainty and a lack of control. The matter of power relations, the attempts to standardize digital solutions and the conflict between cost efficiency and if digital care solutions add value for patients, all caused moral dilemmas for eldercare professionals. The findings suggest a need for organizational infrastructure that promotes ethical conduct and behaviour, ethics training and access to related resources.Implications for rehabilitation The transition to digital care service is not neutral, but value-laden. Digital transformation affects ethical behaviour and decision-making. The decision as to which digital services should be developed and deployed must include eldercare professionals and not lay solely in the hands of managers, technologists and economists. We must move away from attempting to fit standardized solutions to a heterogenous group of older patients; accommodating the pluralism of patients’ needs and wants protects their dignity, autonomy and independence. As digital care practices evolve, so too must organizational structures that promote ethical conduct.},

In recent years, new technical solutions have extended traditional lighting systems to become ‘smart’. Different types of smart lighting systems are available on the market today, and researchers have concentrated on analysing their usability and efficiency, especially for private households, office buildings and public streets. This paper presents a systematic literature review to analyse the state-of-knowledge of technologies and applications for smart lighting systems. The results of the review show that smart lighting systems have been frequently discussed in the literature, but that their potentials in industrial environments, such as production and logistics, has rarely been addressed in the literature so far. Lighting systems for industrial environments often have very different requirements depending on the working environment and operating conditions. Based on the results of the literature review, this paper contributes to closing this research gap by discussing the usage potential of smart lighting systems to improve the efficiency of warehouse order picking, which is an application that may benefit from various functions smart lighting systems provide. Several propositions are developed that emphasise research opportunities and managerial implications in this context.},

This is especially the case for production and logistics facilities such as warehouses, where large areas have to be illuminated, and where lighting is often fully turned on while the warehouse operates. This paper presents a simulation model developed to evaluate the cost benefits potentially resulting from using smart lighting systems in warehouses. The simulation model allows for varying warehouse design and order picking process parameters. In addition, three different operating strategies for lighting systems representing different types of smart lighting technologies are implemented and compared to a conventional lighting system. A structured simulation study provides insights into how smart lighting systems interact with system design and process parameters, and how both collectively influence warehouse operating costs. The results of the simulation model and data obtained from a practical case indicate that smart lighting systems have great potential for reducing the energy consumption in warehouses relative to conventional lighting, and that, in addition to savings in cost, they can contribute to improving the environmental footprints of warehouses.},

Continuous or repeated monitoring of structural responses may add important information for decision-making regarding their maintenance, repair and reinforcement. The use of these data, in conjunction with techniques of structural reliability for the treatment of the uncertainties, allows a better understanding of the structural behaviour and integrity. Modern Information and Communication Technologies can greatly contribute to the improvement of the maintenance capacity and, consequently, to the reliability of the assets and to their operational availability. New wireless communication technologies, such as 5 G networks, are considered as the enabling technologies of the digital transformation, integrated with the concept of the Internet of Things. High connectivity capacity and intensive automation enable, for example, changes in inspection paradigms and asset maintenance, by transferring the product focus to service platforms, bringing gains to productivity, comfort, operational safety and costs. New predictive maintenance approaches, which make use of a large amount of data available, can improve the efficiency of maintenance processes, producing more accurate and reliable anticipated diagnostics. The Digital Twins incorporate all these tools and allow a real-time view of the evolution of the asset behaviour. This concept applied to a railway bridge is presented and discussed in detail in this paper.},

   abstract = {While digital space is explained in itself by computer science, important questions for the humanities - such as how the Digital affects human behaviour, or how it impacts society and economy–are outside its scope. Different disciplines have provided answers, but there has been no integrated concept bridging these insights. This paper proposes a concept to explain the Digital by integrating insights from computer science, media studies, sociology and philosophy. The resulting framework suggests that the Digital consists of characteristic dynamics, spaces and mechanisms. After explaining the concept of Digital Machine, an ontological framework consisting of four main fields of analysis - Transformation, Territory, Frame and Use - is proposed. With Transformations and Territories, the processes of the Digital and its wider socio-political and economic dimensions are analysed. Within Frames, human action and interpretation happen. In the Uses of the Digital, consumption has become a form of production, and User’s uses can be analysed in the differential between the intents of a Digital Machine and the interpretations of its users. To conclude, Anders’ concept of Promethean slope is taken to explain the increasing problems of humans to distinguish the actions of algorithms from human action, and future implications of the evolution of the Digital are discussed. Finally, routes for digital innovation and recommendations for design practice are proposed.},

   abstract = {As digital technologies pervade established industries, their constituent firms are likely to become technologically dependent upon industry outsiders due to increased mobility of strategic resources and porosity of inter-industry boundaries. We conceptually study this global phenomenon and argue that firms in established industries mitigate their cross-industry resource dependence arising from digitalization via corporate venturing. Unlike their larger counterparts, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in established industries may pursue alternatives to traditional corporate venturing practices such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, or corporate venture capital investments. Specifically, we propose that SMEs may use acquihiring as a response to mitigate their technological dependence on digital outsiders. This study conceptualizes the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” of acquihiring by SMEs in established industries. In doing so, it contributes to the literature on cross-industry M&A strategies for SMEs in the digital era, entrepreneurial exits, and novel modes of corporate venturing.},

Utilizing a household survey measuring digital inclusiveness and ANOVA analysis, findings suggest that there are different levels of digital inclusiveness between groups. Differences in internet use and benefits are larger between younger and older groups. There are also differences between urban and rural areas. A statistically modeled digital parity scenario still finds uneven levels of digital inclusiveness, though urban and rural differences disappear, implying deeper and more complex inequality issues are at play. Future research should gather nationally representative survey data and see if findings hold. Regardless and as shown by COVID-19, community development practitioners need to incorporate digital inclusion strategies to ensure their communities transition to, adapt, and prosper in a sustainable way in this unfolding digital age.},

The paper explores ways in which innovation in services is increasingly becoming one of social innovation (in terms of social goals, social means, social roles and multi-agent provision) and how social innovation can be understood from a service innovation perspective. A taxonomy is proposed based on the mix between innovation nature and the locus of co-production. The paper additionally puts forward a theoretical framework for understanding social innovation in services, where the co-creation of innovation is the result of an interaction of competences and preferences of multiple providers, users/citizens, and policy-makers. This provides the basis for a discussion of key avenues for future research in theory, measurement, organisation, appropriation, performance measurement and public policy.

However, there seems to be confusion about the most effective methods for initiating this transformation, and even more so for the manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME). In a context of labor shortages, globalization and access to goods, services and skills everywhere and at any time thanks to the Internet, the need to stand out from the competition becomes a crucial issue. This research attempts to evaluate and identify the most effective ways to facilitate the digitalization in a context of manufacturing SMEs. Thanks to the measure of the digital performance and an 80-hour experience-based methodology using a questionnaire and field interviews, the determining factors of influence of the digital transformation could be raised. This paper uses a model of digital performance and hypothesis testing to try to identify the business practices and the 4.0 technologies that have the greatest effect on the performance of manufacturing SMEs. The results then intents to guide the efforts both in academia and in the field concerning digitalization of SMEs.},

   abstract = {Digital health is the foundation for the future growth of healthcare. The healthcare industry is leveraging digital transformation to empower the association between physicians and patients and ameliorate health results. Researchers and experts in health informatics are eager to see how new technologies can be used in the healthcare domain to enable real-time health monitoring, such as remote access to users' health data, tracking and alerts, and real-time reporting, allowing doctors to better care for their patients. By improving the security, privacy, and interoperability of health records, as well as easing Health Information Exchanges (HIE), the adoption of healthcare technologies can be encouraged. This can be accomplished through the use of a three-factor authentication architecture, which not only increases information assurance at a cheap rate but also defends patients' privacy in dispersed systems. Hence, using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this paper reflects patients’ and health professionals’ intention to use and implement the three-factor authentication in the master component of information technology in health: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. User authentication is an important component that possibly is incorporated in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to shield patient information and restrict access to the medical server by unauthorized individuals. This research aimed to discover the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, trust, security and privacy, Information Integrity, and computer self-efficacy and the intention to use three-factor authentication for EHR systems. Respondents were requested to fill the questionnaire on their health data using google forms and partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze around 193 responses. Results stipulated that intention to use was directly influenced mainly by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, trust, and information integrity. Age, gender, and knowledge of data security and privacy were used to conduct a moderation analysis, which revealed significant variations between the groups in terms of the effectiveness of certain associations and the average responses between the variables. This will aid the researchers in identifying the latest trends and recognizing areas in the authentication system that need improvement.},

Drawing on the literature of crisis innovation, this study aims to understand the transformations that have taken place in the Spanish journalistic industry and the innovations implemented during the pandemic. The research questions are: How has COVID-19 fostered innovation in work organisation in the Spanish newsrooms? What other innovations were launched by the Spanish media during the pandemic? The methodology is based on semi-structured interviews conducted with a purposive sample of 20 media practitioners and 20 experts on journalism innovation (academics and journalists) in Spain. Results show that newsroom practices have evolved through telework, collaboration and other factors, and that digital transformation was accelerated in legacy media. In many outlets, the science section was increasingly relevant, working in a coordinated way with the areas of data visualisation and design to produce relevant content. Also, fact-checkers played an important role in fighting misinformation. The pandemic has speeded up some ongoing innovations in news production, newsroom organisation, distribution, and commercialisation in a significant way. Thus, COVID-19 understood as a crisis situation has had an impact on news products and it has affected journalistic culture.},

The objective of this study was to investigate how Spanish students with disabilities perceive access to Higher Education and the day-to-day of their academic life. A qualitative design was performed, using sequential discourse analysis adapted to the area of studies with people with disabilities. Two focus groups and sixteen interviews with university students with disabilities were analyzed. The discursive strategies of the students presented an asymmetry between the normative and the factual, although within a framework of inclusion and integration into university life. Six types of barriers were identified: computer, bureaucratic, and architectural -more intense in the traditional universities-, and learning, personal, and social barriers -stronger in online universities. To ensure the inclusion of students with disabilities, there is a need to increase information and training and to establish common procedures across Higher Education institutions. Points of interest Despite the legislative measures regarding inclusion in Higher Education, the representativeness of students with disabilities in Spain is low. Students with disabilities found six different types of barriers in accessing university studies in Spain. Research shows that Spanish university students with disabilities consider dropping out of Higher Education due to the difficulties they encounter on a day-to-day basis. Spanish university students with disabilities detect barriers that are specific to society, in general, and to the university system, in particular, that prevent a real equality beyond the deficits of their disabilities. Improvements should be oriented towards the training and awareness of the entire university community and its standards of practice.},

The aim of this paper is to explain the role of digital technologies in such hybrid strategies for small businesses. We first identify automation, individualization and interdisciplinarity as the three dimensions of digital technologies that together enable technology-driven firms to gain and sustain competitive advantages and to scale rapidly.

This research seeks to address these issues and determine the capabilities that influence the creation of new and existing value propositions and the subsequent structural changes of digital transformation in healthcare by analyzing interviews with 19 American healthcare executives. Results highlight the need for patient-focused modes of value creation necessary to improve care coordination, which is affected by the ability to integrate data and reconfigure processes. End user focused modes compel healthcare organizations to digitize their services, however, this can be hampered by difficulties with change management and enforcing IT governance processes.},

Of particular interest for this purpose are the existing studies on sustainability, which provide a viable research model to assess and validate the potential effect of each CRM component (sales, marketing, and services) on the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social). Upon confirmation of our hypotheses, the subsequent validation of such model should bring a better understanding of the way in which CRM-related benefits may increase the positive impact of its components on each dimension of sustainability. CRM can hence be considered a sort of Green IT, oriented toward digital transformation and sustainable business model innovation. Indeed, this research model may be the basis for a more specific methodology to measure the impact and benefits of applying CRM, understood, as we will contend, both in terms of sustainable business models and innovation.},

Contrary to the imaginary of digital transformation as preceding an era of limitless global networking in the 1990s, approaches to state regulation and delimitation of data flows as well as programmes for national digital infrastructures are justified with calls for digital sovereignty across very different contexts. This forum brings together contributions from political geography, law, computer science, and ethics that compare and analyse discourses and practices of digital sovereignty. The case studies on Russia and the EU reveal parallels as well as fundamental differences in the conception and implementation of digital sovereignty. Essays on the challenges posed by new forms of cross-border interaction (such as cloud computing) and new actors (such as digital platforms) illustrate that the traditional coupling of concepts of sovereignty, territoriality and the state, of jurisdiction and borders, must be rethought. The essays in this forum thus make it clear that the digital transformation is not simply a socio-technical modernisation process. It is rather shaped in specific ways and should be understood and analysed as (geo)-political discourses and practices. The forum contributes to the development of a political digital geography that analyses how the digital transformation is contested and produced in specific ways and unearths the politics and spatialities conceived and produced in these discourses and practices.},

Building on a conceptual framework proposed in this paper, our evaluation of the literature shows which types of assistive devices were analysed in the past, and from which perspective these devices were examined. Some works studied the devices exclusively from an operator well-being or an efficiency perspective, while several works analysed the devices’ performance in terms of both dimensions. Several works contained in our literature sample highlighted trade-offs between both ergonomic and economic measures and, within the first category, between alternative ergonomic indicators, which shows that assistive devices have to be evaluated carefully in light of their intended application. The paper further identifies research gaps and emphasises the need to understand the interactions between human- and system-related variables that can be supported by assistive devices in designing effective manual materials handling systems.},

However, most companies are not aware or not capable of assessing their Industry 4.0 maturity level. Since many considerations on Industry 4.0 successfulness include elements of the quality management system, ISO 9004:2018 guidance for achieving sustained success is considered in this paper as a possible basis for assessment of maturity level of quality in Industry 4.0, framed as Quality 4.0. The questionnaire with a sample size of 335 companies is used to explore the topic. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to verify the ISO 9004:2018 model potential to be used for assessing Quality 4.0 maturity level. Results show that the Context of an organisation positively impacts the Identity of an organisation and Leadership. Therewithal, the Identity of an organisation is recognised to be a positive influencing predictor of Leadership that is proved to be a positive predictor of Process management and Resource management. Furthermore, Resource management is proved to have a positive impact on Performance analysis and evaluation as well on Improvement, learning and innovation construct. The findings indicate the model is usable in the context of Quality 4.0. Such a model could be utilised as a basis for developing a sustainable Quality 4.0 system roadmap.},

Even when worldwide enterprise IT spending for the government and education markets has been increasing and is expected to surpass $652 billion in 2023 to cater to such transformation programs, 80% of the government transformation efforts failed to achieve expected results. A plausible reason for this lacklustre performance could be the presence of tradeoffs or conflicts that is particularly salient in public organisations. To better understand the mechanisms by which IT enables or inhibits capabilities of the public organisations in attaining public value, we adopt a conflict resolution lens to study how information technology (IT) enabled capabilities to mitigate these tradeoffs. Using a dataset collected from public organisations in a European country unreeling from a financial crisis, we examine the processes by which IT enables public organisations to manage the tradeoffs arising from conflicting value-based goals. We identify three mitigation strategies facilitated via IT-enabled organisational capabilities–bias, tunnelling and hybridisation. This paper contributes to the understanding of how IT mitigates value-based tradeoffs in public organisations to achieve public value.},

However, as a result of the systematic literature review and its analysis, it was observed that none of the 18 existing maturity models in the digital transformation domain fully satisfies all the criteria of suitability, completeness, clearness, and objectivity. To close this research gap, this study aims to develop a holistic maturity model in the digital transformation domain, entitled DX-CMM, by applying a theoretically grounded development approach, which has so far been neglected despite its remarkable relevance. The purpose of DX-CMM is to assist organisations by providing current capability and maturity determination, deriving a gap analysis, and creating a comprehensive roadmap for improvement in a standardised way.

A trained clone can be used by a decision-maker as an additional resource for one’s own cognitive enhancement, as an autonomous representative, or even as a replacement when appropriate. The assumption regarding this approach is as follows: when someone was forced to leave a critical process because of, for example, sickness, or wanted to take care of several simultaneously running processes, then they would be more confident knowing that their autonomous digital representatives were as capable and predictable as their exact personal “copy”. The Pi-Mind agent was evaluated in a Ukrainian higher education environment and a military logistics laboratory.

By exploring the likely impact of clusters on Industry 4.0, our discussion revolves around the broader question of the role of regional ecosystems in industrial transformation. Clusters, thanks to the advantages such as knowledge base and mechanisms, agglomeration economies and externalities (labour pool and critical mass of firms) and favourable more stable, less uncertain environment of trust and cooperation, may facilitate the digital transformation, particularly its phasing-in and testing phases. Notwithstanding this potential, it should be stressed that not all clusters would be able to play such prominent role. Only these equipped with adequate knowledge base and providing some expertise in the field of IT solutions, robotics, automatics, and so on, i.e. the technologies crucial to Industry 4.0 seem predestined to contribute to the emergence of fully fledged industrial internet.

Our study focuses on a clear theoretical and managerial question–how do RAS manage FLV that does not easily fit into traditional models? Design/methodology/approach: The research collected data through semi-structured interviews (138 respondents) and focus group discussions (342 participants) in 30 RAS. The framework built drives the data analysis. Findings: The study shows that although most of the RAS provided poor support and did not write FLV in their project documents, many are increasingly using FLV. Extension workers see FLV as a way to efficiently and effectively achieve their goals–a helpful tool that could reduce workload. Moreover, the presence of FLV champions who are generally young and the high level of positive attitude toward FLV as well as collaboration with other organizations favor the increasing use of FLV. Practical implications: The results of this study can be used by policymakers and RAS to improve the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into their work. Theoretical implications: This study sheds more light on the importance of a holistic approach to thoroughly understand the challenges of FLV implementation in RAS with theoretical implications for their design, implementation, and analysis. Originality: This study reports the ﬁrst known application of a holistic approach to understanding the challenges of FLV implementation in RAS in Benin.},

The interviews are focused on institutional strategy, and the leaders rarely mention technology. Not so this year. As institutional leaders talk about the (hopefully) final months of the pandemic and a postpandemic vision for their institutions, technology is taking center stage across higher education in a way have never before seen. The interviewees spoke about technology as a core aspect of their plan to recover enrollments, to attract new learners, to introduce new efficiencies and simplifications, and to form and deepen partnerships with employers, communities, and other institutions. Whether they named it--and several did--or simply described it, these leaders are talking about digital transformation (Dx). COVID-19 has given college and university presidents and academic and administrative leaders deeper experience applying technology to everything they do, whether an institution is predominately online or fully campus-based. The pandemic has better prepared higher education to engage in Dx to create the post-COVID-19 institution.},

   abstract = {The present article aims to analyse wage-labour productivity causalities in Croatia and Slovenia using cointegration methods based on monthly time series data of variables for labour productivity and real gross wages in tourism industry during the period December 1999–January 2020. The data vector is integrated by chain indices with the constant base January 2000 = 100. A stochastic trend and shocks are covered in the analysis. Shocks are linked to the European Union accession, and economic crisis following with overwhelmed tourist arrivals. The contribution of the research is two-fold. First, the equations for at most normal distributed variables of labour productivity and real wages in tourism are exposed. Three spatial cointegration relations confirm labour productivity integrity of the regional tourism market. Second, pair-wise causalities indicate one cointegrated vector for labour productivity, which drives real gross wages in tourism sub-industries. These results suggest that for a higher non-seasonal assessment of real gross wage, the labour productivity should rise, i.e. less workers, more robotization or more tourist arrivals with better quality solutions. These findings are at most important to be implemented after the COVID-19 infection crisis with expected restructurings and digital transformation in the tourism industry.},

We use Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis to map the indicator ‘tour operator’s employment growth’ components decomposed by the Shift Share Analysis Method. Analysed Eurostat data for 266 regions (281 regions) indicates that for the average regional tour operators employment growth heterogeneity is driven almost at half by region-specific factors.

When businesses encounter risky situations (calculated risks) complex models using BDA are often the go-to solution. However, there is a still a debate if BDA is the best solution in uncertain situations when unexpected phenomena arise. The present study begins to fill this gap using the Colombian context as evidence and a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method (fs-QCA). The focus shifts from a single cause leading to performance to an analysis of different associations of conditions. There are three major findings-first, in a risky environment, BDA is not a unique condition; a combination of data maturity levels, data skills and a data-driven mindset and culture are necessary to obtain good business performance. Second, even in the era of Big Data, large companies still use simple rules (heuristics) to make decisions which improve their performance. Finally, the environmental state (uncertain, certain, risky) is a moderating factor in the choice between BDA or Heuristics. The results indicate marketing managers should use a multi-model approach incorporating both BDA and heuristics.},

Notwithstanding the extensive literature on museum performance measurement, the analysis of the role of technological innovation is relatively neglected. As a first attempt to fill this lacuna, this study presents a two-stage analysis of a novel sample of Italian state-owned museums built by merging information drawn from different sources. In the first stage, we use bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure the efficiency of museums. In the second stage, we use a bootstrap truncated regression approach to test the extent to which different forms of ICT affect museum efficiency. We distinguish the ICT investments into ‘in situ’ and online services, since the former improve the visitors’ experience on site, while the latter can prepare for the visit or, even, be a substitute of the visit. The results reveal that the use of ICT is generally associated with better performances but ‘in situ’ services show to play a major role.},

However, research on DT as a profound organizational change process, as well as salespeople’s individual psychological reactions to such initiatives, is still limited. Although DT offers salespeople more and better resources for work-related goal attainment, it increases job demands and typically generates high uncertainty, which companies must then manage. We draw on job demands-resources (JD-R) theory to account for these bright and dark side effects simultaneously. We analyze the direct, mediated, and moderated effects of uncertainty reduction initiatives (resources) and excessive workload (demands) on the perceived usefulness of DT (i.e. salespeople’s motivation to embrace it), the stress it generates, and the ultimate success of DT integration. In doing so, we shed light on the complex pattern of relationships that characterizes salespeople’s psychological reactions to DT. Using DT context-specific constructs, we test our model and hypotheses on a sample of 144 salespeople of a firm engaged in DT. Our results fill several gaps in the technology in sales, DT, and JD-R literatures, and we provide managers with several guidelines to better manage DT in sales.},

Digitalization also provides completely new ways of addressing issues related to global health. This paper provides an overview of the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and in what way the field has contributed to international development in different regions of the world. Additionally, it outlines the United Nations' new sustainability goals from December 2015 and what these could contribute to the development of global health and its relationship to digitalization. Finally, it argues why and how HCI could be adopted and adapted to fit the contextual needs, the need for localization and for the development of new digital innovations. The research methodology is mostly qualitative following an action research paradigm in which the actual change process that the digitalization is evoking is equally important as the scientific conclusions that can be drawn. In conclusion, the paper argues that digitalization is fundamentally changing the society through the development and use of digital technologies and may have a profound effect on the digital development of every country in the world. But it needs to be developed based on local practices, it needs international support and to not be limited by any technological constraints. Particularly digitalization to support global health requires a profound understanding of the users and their context, arguing for user-centred systems design methodologies as particularly suitable.},

The study finds that digital transformation significantly eases the financing constraints of SMEs, and the conclusion remains valid after considering endogeneity issues and conducting robustness tests. The mechanism analysis manifests that SMEs improve the quality of external information disclosure through digital transformation, thereby alleviating financing constraints. In addition, the impact of digital transformation on the financing constraints of SMEs demonstrates prominent heterogeneity. The mitigation effect of digital transformation is more pronounced in areas where digital financial is well developed, in state-owned enterprises, high-tech enterprises and long-term oriented enterprises.

   abstract = {Open search is crucial to business model design. In recent years, the digital revolution has significantly reshaped the open search environment and the business model landscape. The traditional ‘either/or’ paradigm that separately tests the effects of open search breadth and depth on business model design is no longer applicable. By introducing the ‘both/and’ paradigm, this study explores how open search breadth and depth, both jointly and in an orderly manner, impact hybrid business model design. Using a sample of digital startups during the opportunity window of China’s digital entrepreneurship, we find that open search breadth positively relates to the balance between technology- and consumer-oriented business models. Furthermore, under the premise of high breadth, open search depth shows a U-shaped relationship with this balance. This study not only enriches our knowledge of the antecedents of business model design but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of open search.},

This article is the first effort to empirically investigate the nexus between digital transformation and FDI inflows, thereby finding a way to help countries overcome the current situation. Using the data of 23 European countries pre-COVID (2015–2019) and during the COVID health crisis (2020), we demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between digitalization and FDI inflows, implying that a certain extent of digital transformation could promote the inflows of FDI. Before the COVID-19 health crisis, digital business played a critical role in attracting FDI inflows. E-commercial activities also enhanced FDI flows during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and digital public services may be an effective tool to help countries overcome the health crisis. Furthermore, digitalization plays a critical role in promoting FDI inflows in both the short term and long term. Hence, digital transformation is an inevitable process that countries need to embrace in order to overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and resolve the delay or lack of foreign investments.},

Our estimation results show that digitalization in the business sector positively influences economic complexity. There is evidence on the long-term cointegration between digital business and economic complexity. Furthermore, we provide some evidence that an improvement in economic growth, financial development as well a reduction in the pervasiveness of corruption are transmission channels through which digitalization in the business sector positively impacts the performance of economic complexity. On the other hand, economic complexity also plays a critical role in accelerating the process of digitalization in the business sector. Furthermore, these effects are only evident in the long term.},

However, due to a lack of solid assessment framework and procedures to evaluate the current status and readiness to change in the academic literature, many manufacturing firms frequently fail to assess, assimilate, or struggle to implement Industry 4.0 technologies and processes. To fill this need, this research proposes a novel multi-dimensional analytical framework and indicators for assessing Industry 4.0 maturity and preparedness. This framework include-six dimensions and 32 indicators that have been tested with reference to a large multinational steel manufacturing company. The study employed CCA and IPMA analysis techniques to validate the survey data from the case company. The results support and verify the status wherein the supply chain dimension has the highest performance, and the business model dimension has the lowest in terms of Industry 4.0 maturity and readiness status. The framework and index thus developed have practical relevance as it is easy to understand, interpret and validate in any other manufacturing organization. Furthermore, this study is the first to apply the structural equation modelling technique, i.e. CCA and IPMA, to evaluate Industry 4.0 maturity and readiness from a developing country perspective in the context of steel manufacturing.},

The designed model integrates three key stages, that is, planting, storage, and distribution, to help growers make the optimal decisions for maximising revenue. Decisions are made after comprehensive consideration of market factors such as price and demand as well as agricultural characteristics such as crop yield and shelf life. Results of numerical experiments show that significant improvement of benefits can be obtained through the overall decision-making of planting, storage, and distribution. Additionally, it may be most beneficial for growers to keep the warehouse’s storage time and storage capacity at a medium level. The IoT-based integrative decision-making method explored in this study can be applied to other fields including manufacturing to achieve more efficient production and operations management.},

It has lowered the access barrier for actors to become publicly visible and reconfigured predominantly vertical flows of information into horizontal communication networks. Media-centric studies hold that these ‘hybrid media systems’ do not subvert the analogue order tout court, as the media still occupy a central role in selection and distribution processes. In contrast to this, social movement scholars interested in digital forms of mobilization show that civil society actors can directly engage their base and the wider public. Because of this focus, the status and role of the media in these connective efforts has remained largely neglected. This study extends the view of both media-centric and social movement research by asking how the media are included in civil society mobilization efforts online and what status and role they have. Analysing the online communication around the UK climate change debate over a 30-month period, we show that while the media account for a substantial amount of the actors in the networks generated by civil society actors and bloggers, they become more marginal with respect to the authority they command. Not only are they replaced by bloggers as focal points in these digital political communication ecologies, they become next to irrelevant in allocating visibility and attention to other actors. This has ambivalent consequences for democratic discourse, as online debates become more inclusive but also more fragmented, lacking common points of reference.},

The mechanism analysis shows that digital transformation improves corporate financing by reducing information asymmetry and transaction costs on both sides of financing and enhancing corporate performance. Combined with the mechanism analysis, we reveal that digital transformation has a significant effect on the alleviation of financing constraints among firms with private ownership, higher levels of interaction with investors, more developed financial environments and more intermediaries marketed in their locations, higher proportions of highly skilled workers, and better matching of digital technologies used for transformation. We explore micro-level measurement methods of corporate digital transformation, contributes to the literature on the economic consequences of digital transformation, and enriches the research on enterprise responses to financing constraints.

This has been particularly true in the South Pacific, despite the existence of the regional University of the South Pacific. Building a national university with the limited financial resources of a small developing country presents numerous challenges. This paper, using a critical ethnographic methodology, examines the lessons from the first ten years (2010–20) of Fiji National University from the perspective of an insider researcher. Some challenges are common to new universities created by merging smaller colleges. Others are more specific to developing countries, including the dependence on public funding and political patronage. Some challenges are more distinctively Pasifika, with cultural values of familial loyalty and respect for elders, sometimes in conflict with ‘imported’ management practices. The spectre of neo-colonialism is ever present.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Majority of the assessments, appraisals and placements have been disturbed, with some being cancelled, postponed, or modified in design. New approaches for assessment should be well-thought-out. This work attempts at capturing the collective wisdom of educators in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), providing an understanding of the online assessment conceptual framework in the era of COVID-19 that tells the story rather than determining cause and effect, and identifying the biggest gaps that derail the digital transformation. Methods: A qualitative inductive study using the grounded theory approach was implemented following a synchronous virtual online meeting, a summary of the reflections as well as experiences of medical education experts was prepared. Data for this qualitative study were collected from the meeting. The meeting was video-recorded and transcribed by the researchers. Thematic analysis was performed by three separate researcher coders. The authors then discussed together until they reached a consensus. Results: Three main thematic areas were identified: 1) feasibility, 2) exam fairness/equity and 3) acceptable graduate attributes, society/community acceptance. Conclusion: The COVID-19 era necessitated revisiting of our assessment strategies to cope with new changes within the available context. Rapid adaptation is required.},

Correct material flows through a circular system are difficult to achieve, but emerging technology may provide some answers. Among these technologies, blockchain, smart tags and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are showing promising solutions. However, adopting technology gives rise to certain challenges. Observing the global trend in digital transformation, this paper investigates the adoption of blockchain and its associated technologies. Through interviews with designers and technology providers, it identifies the challenges specific to the small and medium enterprise sector. It finds a number of areas that require focus–some outside and some within the control of the business owner. These include the need for more effective communication channels between the information systems (IS) sector and fashion industry stakeholders if the digital transformation of the circular economy is to be effective.},

Given the primary objective for sales educators to equip students for future employment in the sales industry, addressing the insights and recommendations Zoltners and colleagues present in the education process is necessary. Digitalization in sales continues to evolve and as a result, many practitioners and academics are in a state of “building the bicycle while riding it.” In light of this shift, we believe academic institutions have an opportunity to incorporate several of the insights from the article into their sales courses.

The results show a predominance of the most classical perspectives from which the tutoring role can be considered, in which the participants perceive themselves as the means whereby they can guide, inform and give emotional support to the students from an individual and transactional position. However, these perspectives are far removed from the idea that this function is carried out from a paradigm that is social and/or shared with other agents, based on a horizontal relationship and for the purpose of encouraging individual autonomy and a capacity for self-regulation. The unquestioning acceptance of a complex role invites us to reflect on the tutors’ professional learning, which leads us to new questions.},

Digitalization is closely linked to smart governance, through which administrative units such as cities and regions increasingly offer digital services related to spatial planning. However, the increasing digitalization of spatial planning has received little attention in academic planning literature, and few studies have analysed how digitalization affects planning practice. The aim of this study was to help fill this gap by developing an analytical framework based on efficiency, transparency and innovation, to explore how digital plan data affect land-use planning. The framework was applied in a multi-case study analysis of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. In this study, which is one of the first to shed empirical light on the digital transformation of land-use planning, we found changes in planning practice mainly in terms of efficiency and transparency, less in terms of innovation. We have identified a great need for further research to attend critically to digital transformation of planning in order to optimize the benefits for planning practice and to avoid an unreflective shift towards technocratic planning practices.},

Since most design tasks are ultimately unique and therefore not operational, fully automatic façade design will not always lead to a satisfactory result. For these reasons, the authors propose a targeted combination of rational (rule-based) and intuitive (poetic) design strategies. The design task is divided into operational subtasks that are processed automatically on the computer and non-operational subtasks that are solved by computers and humans together. A creative and agile design team evaluates different variants proposed by the computer. Promising developments will be pursued and further developed. Then the generative mechanism is adapted and the design is optimized. The concept is refined until a sustainable, user-oriented design is available. However, for the foreseeable future, the solution of non-operational problems will only be possible through human intelligence. The fear that good architecture can be generated at the push of a button and that computers will replace architects and engineers is therefore unfounded.},

Providing adequate incentives to foster knowledge sharing on a knowledge management system is a challenge for many organisations. It is especially important in the humanitarian context where organisational efficiency leads to saving more lives. We argue that gamification (i.e., the integration of game-like features, such as points or badges in non-game systems) is a viable solution to address the lack of knowledge sharing often encountered. To do so, we embark on a design science journey with Doctors Without Borders to investigate how gamification within (e.g., using a personal profile) and outside (e.g., using a connected ambient object) a knowledge management system can improve knowledge sharing. Our findings demonstrate that well-designed gamification can increase engagement and knowledge sharing, in particular for altruistic individuals.},

This present study proposes formalization for user feedback including engagement and interactions to understand and improve intelligent adaptive quizzing. This work starts by taking individual system’s action transition patterns as a temporally evolving action graph and derives patterns in terms of informing future user engagement. Furthermore, considering the student knowledge preference for a certain moment is closely related to personal experience of past learning,a novel framework EICQ (Engagement and Interaction-based Computer-Supported Adaptive Quizzing) is proposed for learning and adapting to students’ current preference based on engagement trends and interaction by collecting feedback data in real-time during a learning session. This established framework captures question characters, student dynamic interactions and engagement trends, which yield a better learning experience with adaptive practice question (PQ) recommendations. Finally, much more endeavors have been made to integrate the proposed EICQ into XXXU intelligent learning systems that are co-developed with the YYY Company.},

However, owing to the difficulty in sample manufacturing, the evaluation of the overall piezoelectric properties for reliable device design using simulations is challenging. Herein, a two-step simulation was performed to accurately determine the overall properties of the porous PZT. First, the piezoelectric charge constant was calculated by displacement calculations using the electrostrictive effect. Second, using the calculated piezoelectric charge constant and impedance spectrum obtained from the experiment, the initial value for optimizing the properties was selected, and the overall properties were obtained using the parametric estimation technique. These parametric estimation simulation procedures were performed with the samples of radial and thickness modes based on the IEEE standards. Finally, the piezoelectric properties obtained were compared and verified with the experimental values. Therefore, the overall piezoelectric properties include mechanical, frequency and dielectric properties according to the porosity were obtained with reliable results.},

However, a direct link between financial development and human capital, in the long run, has not been investigated, in particular in emerging markets in Asia. This study investigates the nexus between financial development and human capital for a group of nine emerging markets in the Southeast Asian region over the period 1990–2018. Econometric techniques allowing for cross-sectional dependence and panel co-integration, such as the dynamic least squares (DOLS) and fully modified least squares (FMOLS), are used. We also use three indicators as the proxies for financial development: broad money supply, bank credit, and private sector credit. Empirical findings from this paper indicate that financial development contributes positively and significantly to human capital accumulation. We also find that economic growth enhances the formation of human capital. Results from our Granger causality tests confirm a bi-directional relationship between financial development and human capital. Policymakers from the Southeast Asian emerging markets may need to enhance and extend financial development which is closely linked with human capital accumulation.},

Through a qualitative analysis of 22 interviews, with media professionals and consultants of a German-based print magazine company, we identify a jointly enacted practice that we call “shared inquiry”. This practice includes recursive and adaptive strategizing actions towards (1) searching and learning (actions of employees), (2) facilitating and questioning (actions of managers), and (3) guiding and reflecting (actions of consultants). We demonstrate how these actions form a mechanism through which media managers create the conditions to cope with continuous change and how they manage in order to achieve strategy emergence both locally and on an organization-wide level. Ultimately, we show how strategic actions can be mapped in a continuum that supports “responsive coping”.},

   abstract = {Digital transformation is a major organisational challenge for manufacturing firms due to the extremely low success rate of such transformations to date. Capability Maturity theory suggests that firms need to develop digital transformation capability incrementally by focusing on a ‘vital few’ improvement priorities for advancing progress. The practitioner literature lacks empirical studies that validate extant capability maturity models (CMM) for digital transformation despite their importance. Moreover, there is a lack of assessment methods, and those that exist do not specify improvement points explicitly, nor prioritise them. Our research aims to address this gap through a systematic, quantitative analysis of digital capability by understanding the deployment of IT-enabled resources. Based on a sample of 302 manufacturing firms, results indicate that the digital transformation stages are punctuated by various resource-capability combinations. Results highlight that strategy- and organisation-related IT-enabled resources are the key drivers of digital transformation. We also observe that as a firm’s digital capability grows at each maturity stage, successively greater IT-enabled resources are required to support this in a stepwise function. To succeed, firms should be incentivised and supported to think beyond technology and develop five specific digital capabilities simultaneously. We also indicate the limitations that underlie our empirical work.},

The assessment tool was a standard questionnaire whose face and content validity was confirmed by entrepreneurship experts and its reliability was estimated by conducting a pilot study. The findings showed that exploratory behaviours had a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, mindfulness, and students’ strategic learning. Also, mindfulness influenced entrepreneurial opportunity recognition positively and significantly. However, the effect of strategic learning on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition was insignificant. It can be concluded that exploratory behaviours can influence students’ mindfulness and strategic learning and students’ exploratory behaviours and mindfulness lead to discovering entrepreneurial opportunities.},

In this context, by focussing on a sample of 141 firm-year observations over the period 2017–2019, this paper uses a linear regression model to investigate and fill this gap. Findings significantly show that a high stakeholders’ perception score (SPS) increases firms’ profitability, providing insights that implementing a strategy oriented to stakeholders’ engagement affects a company’s economic performance. It is suggested that practitioners integrate stakeholders’ perception into performance management system (PMS) processes to achieve economically and environmentally-oriented performance.},

   abstract = {The established literature demonstrates the critical role of the policy mix in the formulation and implementation of government policies for industrial upgrading. However, existing studies mainly examine the policy mix from either a horizontal or a vertical coordination perspective; very few examine both dimensions. To gain further insights, the current study involves an analysis of how China’s central government manages horizontal and vertical coordination to pursue upgrading in manufacturing industries on the basis of an ambidextrous policy mix perspective and a thorough examination of both the external attributes (i.e., policy level) and content (i.e., policy instruments and themes) of policy documents. This analysis reveals several viable policy implications in relation to China’s manufacturing transformation. In particular, it finds that China’s policy mix for achieving manufacturing upgrading is highly coordinated on both horizontal and vertical dimensions. Governments at all levels apply the same set of policy instruments; environmental instruments are the most frequently used, followed by supply- and demand-side instruments. The core policy topics within the manufacturing upgrading structure include innovation, industrial transformation, industrial agglomeration, demonstration projects and service-oriented manufacturing. Therefore, this study establishes recommendations for future policies, which should focus on reinforcing guidance regarding national policies, encouraging local governments to apply innovative policy tools and increasing the use of demand-side policy instruments.},

However, this emerging technological artefact may induce both positive and negative consequences for customer decision making. It is yet unknown what constitutes the dimensions of the juxtaposed IT affordances and how they affect customer behaviours in this new social phenomenon. This paper contributes to IS research by uncovering the specific bright and dark sides of IT affordances in live streaming e-commerce and by explaining the cognitive mechanisms underpinning customer purchase and brand citizenship behaviours. We employed a sequential mixed-methods design to embrace and contextualise the theory of affordance, vicarious learning, and cognitive load to rigorously develop a theoretical framework of the juxtaposed IT affordance in live streaming e-commerce. The results indicate that positive affordances (e.g., interactivity, visibility, and entertainment) have stronger effects on both economic and non-economic value. However, the potential dark side (e.g., broadcasting and source diversity) has more negative effects on purchase intention than brand citizenship behaviour, underscoring the importance of involving customers in co-creating brand-related value in live streaming e-commerce. Our findings contribute considerably to the emerging literature on live streaming e-commerce and provide actionable recommendations for practitioners.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To explore changes in agency/client value co-creation, at a time when digital transformation is having a major impact on the marketing communications process. The theoretical framework of the research relates to value co-creation in the service-for-service provision, a fundamental aspect of Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) theory. Methodology/approach: The research was exploratory, primarily using qualitative methods. In addition, some quantitative survey data have also been included to demonstrate greater generalizability on certain key questions. Building on dyadic research with clients and their agencies, the current research includes a survey of agencies; interviews with clients and a follow up survey with clients. Findings: The nature of service-for-service provision between clients and agencies is outlined. Many aspects of service are equally likely to be internally or externally provided. This high crossover particularly relates to supporting aspects of digital marketing. While much digital marketing appears to have initially been provided externally there seems to be a trend to bring these aspects of service in-house. The views of clients and agencies on their relationship, as being either transactional or a partnership, appears to be related to the degree of service required and provided. Research implications: A service-for-service perspective is instructive in considering how changes in the external environment are impacting on what is done by agencies and what is done by clients. This new approach has the potential to enhance existing relationship based research in this context. The services required by clients depend on the resources that they already possess. Therefore, it is the absence of an operant resource that leads to the need for external service provision and in turn requires co-creation. Practical implications: There are no hard and fast rules on what is provided by the agency and what is provided in-house. This relates particularly to digital aspects of marketing and suggests that the level of crossover is higher than historically. With digital media becoming such an important aspect of communicating with customers, this is particularly significant in considering the nature of the relationship between agency and client and whether it is seen as a partnership or transactional. Originality/value/contribution: Historically, the dominant approach to analyzing agency/clients has been to focus on relationships. Taking a service-for-service approach is novel and relevant in analyzing a context in which digitization and media fragmentation has caused significant changes and where the perspectives of S-D Logic have the potential to provide new insights, explaining aspects that are not covered by taking purely a relationship approach. The contribution to S-D Logic is at the level of midrange theory development, through applying ideas from S-D–Logic in the context of the application, helping to refine and add to the credibility of the theory. This exploration of the co-creation of value between clients and their agencies demonstrates the applicability of a framework from S-D Logic in a context that is an important part of marketing management.},

Using an exploratory case study approach, we discuss data-driven administration in the perspective of evidence-based policy-making. Following the tradition of evidence-based policy-making, the advancement of data analytics promotes data-driven administration to solve social problems and innovate government operations. We review relevant cases in Korea and then illustrates how the combinations of two dimensions make practices of data-driven administration successful or not. There is little study pointing out to be mindful of values embedded with social issues in certain domains, even when approached with data-driven administration. The framework of data-driven administration can be used for the better understanding of increasing data analytics practices in the public sector with guiding principles of data readiness and value controversy.},

   abstract = {Africa has recently focused on an ambition to achieve digital transformation through the pursuit of various flagship initiatives which are aimed at achieving its ‘Agenda 2063’ objectives. Digital transformation will be better achieved through appropriate cyber governance policies and mechanisms, and the success of Africa’s Digital Transformation Strategy 2020-2030 hinges on diverse factors. According to the Strategy, African governments have a fundamental responsibility to create an enabling environment, with policies and regulations that promote digital transformation across foundation pillars, which include cybersecurity. The Strategy also stipulates the need to reinforce the region’s human and institutional capacity to secure the cyberspace by building trust and confidence in the use of cyber technologies. The aim of the paper is to examine Africa’s cyber governance agenda in relation to peace and security. While there are political dimensions to determining the thresholds of such discourses in Africa, the uncertainties of governance mechanisms, political underpinnings and limitations in digital capacity may mean that international standards of cyber governance have merely been theoretical in the African context. The paper examines Africa’s extant policies and political strategies for cyber governance, and the region’s interaction with international cyber governance processes. The paper further discusses the prospects and challenges to cyber governance in the region, and the approaches to leveraging international cooperation in promoting cyber stability in the region.},

New ways of combining digital and physical innovations and intensified inter-organisational collaborations are key characteristics for success. Knowledge sharing becomes increasingly important, but its inter-organisational nature and the blurring of organisational boundaries create new challenges for the protection of knowledge. Existing research on knowledge protection mostly focuses on single organisations or on dyadic relationships. Complex sharing arrangements and especially sharing in networks has received little attention so far. This paper presents a literature review, integrating the perspectives of the base domains of knowledge, strategy, innovation, and information security management with the goal to identify knowledge protection requirements in the era of digital transformation. Five avenues for future research on knowledge protection to support organisations coping with challenges imposed by digital transformation are presented.},

   abstract = {Industrial organizations are responding to new risks and opportunities originating from exponentially growing and disruptive digital technologies, by taking company-wide digital transformation initiatives. However, the key enablers of such digital transformation initiatives that facilitate operational performance outcomes in industrial organizations demand further investigation. Therefore, drawing on the sociotechnical system theory (STS), the objective of this study is to explore the digital transformation enablers and their impact on performance outcomes. Research data was collected from four leading industrial organizations that engaged in digital transformation programmes. Our results indicate that leadership, structures, and culture are the key enablers of digital transformation that help industrial organizations to achieve performance outcomes (i.e. collaboration, customer-centricity, and agility). By providing an empirically grounded integrated framework with future research propositions, this study contributes to the existing literature on digital transformation and sociotechnical system theory. MAD statement This article aims to make a difference by exploring industrial digital transformation in order to identify the key enablers and performance outcomes. We highlight the need for alignment and joint optimization of social and technical systems to effectively capitalize on the digital transformation initiatives. Moreover, we call for urgent attention to the development of leaders, as well as the further identification of supportive digital transformation leadership competencies. Competent leaders assume a central role in correcting outdated and invalid assumptions, conceptualizing new ideas, and reinforcing cultural values. Furthermore, we elaborate the necessity of cultural transformation in industrial organizations for impactful digital transformation. Lastly, our findings confirm the significance of organizational structure in digital transformation and simultaneously warn that too little is happening.},

This research aims to reveal the procedures Palestinian universities resorted to during the emergency, due to Covid19 pandemic; and to propose future policies for the continuity of teaching and learning in times of emergency. The research used two data collection techniques, a questionnaire and interviews. The questionnaire was distributed online to all faculty members at 10 Palestinian universities in the West Bank. It was able to collect 249 responses. Interviews were conducted with three vice presidents for academic affairs. Results showed a diversity of procedures and actions were executed by universities to assist students continue learning, such as the quick decision to switch to eLearning. In addition, universities managed to keep students safely learning at distance; administrative and support departments managed to keep up with their duties. Results also revealed that universities were not adequately prepared for e-Learning as there were no clear and integrated plans and policies, neither they were able to manage learning within the new modality. This study proposes some future policies for universities to follow when adopting and implementing e-Learning: through e-Learning quality control policy; e-Learning assessment policy; and readiness policy in emergencies for universities.},

   abstract = {Digital platforms have disrupted traditional news organizations, with new platform-based models gaining ground. However, the incumbents can defend their positions and reap the benefits of multi-sided market structures by establishing a platform business model themselves. We examine a case study of the Austrian News Agency (APA), which gradually formulated a strategy that resulted in a platform-based business model. Platform features were strategized and innovated over time and in phases, with the intent of creating value for customers on both sides of the platform. We found that APA’s platform transformation was enabled by a visionary value proposition backed by a trusted institution’s legitimacy and a co-operative organizational model that provided added incentives for the participating news media companies. The strategy and the business model emerged on the basis of external developments and internal realizations concerning the feasibility of the new platform strategy. Based on our results, we develop a framework for an incumbent strategy formation process towards a platform business model. This framework demonstrates the incumbent organization’s emergent, as well as deliberate, strategic ability to introduce platform features into its business model, based on unique intra-firm synergies with established parts of the business, and highlighting a potential for “incumbent advantage.”.},

In a case study of two South African rural municipalities, capacity was assessed before and after an ICT system was implemented. Using the co-design methodology, stakeholders became part of the design team. The study empirically showed that capacity increased in both municipalities after the ICT system was implemented. The resulting developmental change manifested itself in the sectors of governance, engagement, human resource management, institutional memory, and access to information. The findings showed that understanding the context and current capabilities of stakeholders and investing time in the design of the ICT system resulted in greater impact than literature previously suggested.},

The aim is to increase the understanding of the role that newly graduated students play in digital transformation in construction firms. The study is based on 18 semi-structured interviews and three focus group interviews with new graduates and construction managers in Sweden’s three largest construction firms. The results show that despite having relevant skills, new graduates play a limited role when they are first recruited, as they struggle to close the “knowledge-experience gap”. Gradually, whilst familiarising themselves with how things are done, they act as ambassadors for digitalisation and contribute to the modification of senior colleagues’ beliefs about how technology could be used. However, this development is hampered by them getting caught-up in messy everyday activities, which forces them–like other staff–to prioritise urgent issues over important ones. An observed lack of established practices for how to make use of students’ skills hampers their involvement further. It has been suggested that urgency might not only be a problem, but a solution in that it is possible to increase the sense of urgency around new way of working with digital technologies.},

Algorithmic systems have the potential to change the meaning of critical elements of the engagement between social workers and people who need support. At the same time, social workers are increasingly being required by their agencies to integrate such abstracting technologies and techniques evermore comprehensively into their professional practice. This integration also creates tensions for training future social workers. It requires on the one hand directly responding to an old but intensifying tension between training students technically, and, on the other, providing the pedagogical tools for finding some critical distance from those same technologies and techniques. The article works through this tension of technique/critique, and a second associated tension between deploying technologies of mediated engagement and being present ‘in the room’ (presence/mediation). The consequences of how both tensions are handled, we suggest, are being intensified through the technologization of service-delivery. The article suggests ways of approaching a technical-critical pedagogy that responds to this complexity by being practice-embedded and theoretically engaged.},

First, we try to identify and characterize the barriers businesses face in the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies, investigating the barriers’ impact on the adoption of I4.0 tools. Second, we seek whether the higher level of adoption is followed by the enterprises’ enhanced innovation performance. To that end, we combine a critical literature review with quantitative empirical research. The latter was conducted on a representative sample of 400 Polish manufacturers. The most popular I4.0 technologies implemented by the companies were cybersecurity and social media solutions. The most important barriers were administrative processes and capital expenditures associated with the implementation of Industry 4.0 solutions. Firms’ greater involvement in innovations is followed by their more intensive implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies and the awareness of higher barriers. This study adds to the debate on barriers of innovative processes in companies and allows to draw conclusions valid for firms and policy makers.},

   abstract = {Digital transformation can produce scaling in numbers–growing organisational boundaries by adding new users, customers, or members. For membership-based organisations, such as social movement organisations (SMOs), digital scaling brings an inflow of new resources and members at a pace that previously was unimaginable, as well as mounting power and influence. But sustained rapid growth in new membership also can introduce a tension related to digital scaling and political or social impact. In this research, we trace this tension to member prototype ambiguity–that is, to a perceived variation in the attributes, assumptions, and actions of the new members entering the organisation. Such ambiguity can have a destabilising effect on collective identity that might significantly weaken the political or social impact of the SMO. In this longitudinal study of Amnesty International, we examine how digital transformation and scaling unveiled this tension and how the professional core at two of Amnesty’s national sections, Australia and Sweden, addressed the prototype ambiguity that ensued. This research contributes to the existing literature on digital transformation, prototype ambiguity, and social movements, by providing insight into the challenges and opportunities presented by digital scaling in membership-based organisations such as SMOs.},

   abstract = {To survive in dynamic markets and meet the changing requirements, manufacturing companies must rapidly design new production systems and reconfigure existing ones. The current designer-centric search of feasible resources from various catalogues is a time-consuming and laborious process, which limits the consideration of many different alternative resource solutions. This article presents the implementation of an automatic capability matchmaking approach and software, which searches through resource catalogues to find feasible resources and resource combinations for the processing requirements of the product. The approach is based on formal ontology-based descriptions of both products and resources and the semantic rules used to find the matches. The article focuses on these rules implemented with SPIN rule language. They relate to 1) inferring and asserting parameters of combined capabilities of combined resources and 2) comparison of the product characteristics against the capability parameters of the resource (combination). The presented case study proves that the matchmaking system can find feasible matches. However, a human designer must validate the result when making the final resource selection. The approach should speed up the system design and reconfiguration planning and allow more alternative solutions be considered, compared with traditional manual design approaches.},

However, there is limited research on the impact of digitalisation on improvement work, associated practices and the skills and competencies of quality management professionals. To contribute to this gap, this study draws on a framework based on a conceptual combination of the principles of quality management and the field of occupational competence. The study aims to understand how digitalisation influences the role of quality management professionals, by assessing its influence on the professionals’ improvement practices. The study employs a multiple cross-case research design with data from interviews with nine interviewees, and two focus groups. The results show a so far nascent and limited influence of digitalisation on improvement practices, a need for explorative and team-based practices. Moreover, nine needed skills areas to enhance the professionals’ potential to benefit from digitalisation in improvement work are suggested.

Consequently, this paper aims to determine the current status of IR 4.0 implementation in the seaport sector and to categorise the most critical sustainable factors (CSFs). To meet the aim of this paper, a bibliometric analysis from two major databases, Scopus and Web of Sciences, has been utilised. The result indicates that there are four stages that need to be considered for the implementation of IR 4.0 in the seaport industry: adoption, implementation, operational and evaluation. Currently, IR 4.0 in the expanding phase was applied at the stage of adoption. The outcome of this paper can be used as a benchmark to explore, analyse and vindicate the significant variables for the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution in the seaport sector especially from the Malaysian outlook.},

It is further assessed how such distinctive effects are moderated by three types of entrepreneurs’ social capital, i.e. entrepreneurs’ technological social capital (ETSC), entrepreneurs’ business social capital (EBSC), and entrepreneurs’ institutional social capital (EISC). Using a carefully assembled dataset containing the relevant information of 2363 listed Chinese manufacturing firms covering the period of 2008–2018, these relationships are empirically examined, and the following is found: (1) TDT positively affects FP; (2) MDT has a time-lagged positive effect on FP; (3) ETSC positively moderates the relationship between MDT and FP; (4) EBSC positively moderates the impacts of TDT and MDT on FP.

According to the SWOT analysis, the strengths of Macao’s digital trade in services include the significant progress in technical transformation and an increasing proportion of enterprises using computers and the Internet. The weaknesses lie in the poor information network infrastructure and a shortage of talents in information technology. Developing the digital economy in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and building an international hub for digital trade in the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone-Hengqin provide opportunities for the digital industry. The I.T. technology including ABCD, digital twins, industry 5.0, and FinTech Bridges agreements also bring the opportunities for digital trade. However, Macao’s digital trade in services faces threats from political conflicts and mistrust between countries. This paper has also made suggestions for future practice, including seeking a suitable development model for Macao’s digital trade in service, cooperating with Hengqin to build an international digital trade port and learning about successful experiences from other countries or regions such as Ireland. The findings of this paper will be beneficial to understand the strategic management and SWOT of Macao’s digital trade in services.

   abstract = {Whether digital finance should be included in the quantitative framework of monetary policy in emerging market countries has been widely discussed by scholars. However, the current research just focused on a single format of digital finance, lacking comprehensive analysis at the overall level and the refinement of general rules. Therefore, this paper constructed a spatial econometric model to empirically analyze the impact of digital finance on the effectiveness of monetary policy and its heterogeneity, taking China as the representative of emerging market countries. The empirical test showed that (1) Although the total index of digital finance had a negative impact on economic growth, the interaction between digital finance and monetary policy was significantly positive. This indicated that the “moderating effect” of monetary policy was beneficial to digital finance in promoting economic growth, which was confirmed from the subindexes level as well. (2) The development of digital finance had obvious characteristics of the “polarization effect” and the “spatial spillover effect”. Meanwhile, there was a significant regional difference in the “moderating effect” of monetary policy. (3) In terms of control variables, consumption level, fixed capital formation level, and fiscal policy all had a significant positive impact on economic growth, with a positive “spatial spillover effect”. Whereas, the impacts of COVID-19 and export level on economic growth were both negative. Hence, coping with the challenges of COVID-19 and revitalizing exports were important breakthroughs for emerging market countries to recover the domestic economy. Finally, based on the empirical conclusions, this paper proposed three suggestions. First, monetary policy should be strengthened to intervene in the development of digital finance. Second, digital financial development should be integrated into the quantitative framework of monetary policy. Third, it is essential to build a “double pillar” policy framework to compensate for the shortage of monetary policy.},

Drawing from the Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT), the study seeks to examine the impact of online identity theft on customers’ willingness to engage in e-banking transactions in Ghana. A quantitative survey of 393 valid responses from retail bank customers amongst two leading commercial banks in Ghana for the analyses. Results from the PLS-SEM showed that the research constructs; perceived online identity theft’ positively and significantly predict “fear of financial loss”, “fear of reputational damage”, and “security and privacy concern” whilst the former has a negative mediated-relationship between perceived online identity theft and the intention to engage in e-banking transaction. This study is the first of its kind that has extended the application of the TTAT framework into the study of e-banking transactions. The study serves as a practical tool that will enable the banks in their quest to assess customers’ restriction/aversion towards the use of Fintech while ensuring sustainable growth of e-banking transactions in an emerging economy context. The study is limited to only banking institutions in Ghana without considering other players in the financial sub-sector.

While previous studies on the sharing economy have noted that the top-down nature of its operations has resulted in individualised gains, this paper highlights the collaboration within these settings–leading to individual and mutual monetary and non-monetary benefits–stemming from a shared digital and traditional commons with context-based ideologies and stakeholder actions. This paper gives practitioners a clear understanding of how they can successfully support and create a context for women’s entrepreneurship in the age of digitisation.},

This study examined whether volunteering is a critical resource for older adults in dealing with the motives for internet use, higher internet self-efficacy, and lower obsolescence. For this purpose, a distinction was made between older adults who perform voluntary work in the ICT field, voluntary work outside the ICT field, and older non-volunteers. In the study, 331 older adults (mean, 70 years; range, 60–90 years; 39% female) participated in an online questionnaire and were subsequently divided into three groups (ICT volunteers, non-ICT volunteers, and non-volunteers) based on the replies. As expected, ICT volunteers were characterized by more motives for using the internet, higher internet self-efficacy, and lower perceived obsolescence, and significant variance in the components of these constructs were explained by volunteer status. Interactions indicated a buffer effect, according to which ICT volunteering compensates for higher age and educational disadvantages in the context of internet self-efficacy. References to social support, age and cohort effects, and training programs are discussed.},

A qualitative research design was employed to develop a conceptual framework for BCT in RSCN. This research collected and analysed primary and secondary data from four cases as focal-actors. These focal-actors are from multi-industries in Jordan, namely food, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and toys. These actors are lead-firms and have experience working with RSCNs and technology applications such as BCT. Primary data were acquired from interviews with managers working in these industries, which were supported by the analysis of secondary data that identified two types of themes: internally focused and externally focused BCT-integrated drivers of RSCNs. The analysis also identified how they leverage sustainability performance improvements, including their use of RSCN approaches and features. This research is one of the few attempts to explore BCT integrated into RSCN for better sustainability performance that contributes to the theoretical and practical knowledge of supply chains within emerging economies. All types of actors-as-stakeholders involved with national programs and projects can adopt the new framework. The key findings contribute to the field of RSCN where the adoption of BCT as a broad-based strategy to attain sustainability goals and reverse chain activities along the supply chain is a goal.},

The methodology involves principal component analysis and ordinal logistic regression. The results obtained are at least twofold. First, the leading electronic payment tools adopted by these companies are mobile money, card and Internet payments. Second, their choice can be explained on the one hand by the characteristics of these payment tools such as convenience and cost of use, and on the other hand by contingency factors such as integration level and ICT’s mastery level of the manager. Accordingly, companies should be encouraged to use electronic payment tools based on the driving role they could play in providing basic infrastructure and guarantee financially secure transactions between economic agents. The original contribution of this paper is at least twofold. Firstly, methodologically, this study uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and ordinal logistic regression.

This transformation is particularly challenging for large, traditional industrial manufacturers that often rely on organizational structures that have evolved over decades. To adapt, some companies collaborate with or acquire startups, establish subsidiary firms, or encourage spinoffs in an effort to leave the “old firm” untouched while simultaneously seizing an opportunity to participate in the new market. Other companies are more adventurous and transform their organizational structure. Miele, the leading manufacturer of premium domestic appliances, is among the latter. We describe how Miele met this challenge in 2016 and discuss lessons learned in the four years after the company initiated its transformation process.},

   abstract = {Risk management is essential to every organization’s management plan. It is the strategy by which organizations handle the risks involved with their actions to profit or avoid making decisions that will cost them financially in each activity. Identifying and mitigating potential digital threats and developing and implementing procedures to significantly reduce the likelihood of an organization being targeted by cyberattacks are at the core of effective risk management. This is especially true regarding the risks associated with an organization’s digital footprint. A particularly significant threat to reputation, but also at the same time indirect and direct costs, is the data breach that occurs when a security incident occurs about the data for which the organization is responsible, which results in a violation of confidentiality, availability, or the integrity of the data it manages. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology has transformed the agricultural industry, allowing for large-scale farming based on machine learning and other advanced tools. However, this transformation also exposes farms to cyber risks that can lead to costly data breaches. In this study, we propose a framework for incorporating explainable machine learning (exML) techniques into large-scale farming to enhance cyber risk analysis, mitigate cyber threats, and foster a sustainable rural economy. Specifically, given that an organization needs to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to avoid possible data breaches, this work presents an analytical stochastic modeling of risk with a multi-criteria objective function of low complexity, a factor in an incentive system, to model investment value and cost balancing. The motivation behind the proposed method is to improve cybersecurity, protect data and reputation, foster a sustainable rural economy, leverage explainable machine learning, and adapt to the changing technological landscape. By addressing these motivations, the method aims to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to cyber risk analysis in large-scale farming.},

Despite this interest, insufficient knowledge on the potential benefits and risks of blockchain technology causes vagueness for its successful implementation. Therefore, since effective management of logistics and supply chain operations through advanced solutions is of utmost importance, adopting an innovative approach rather than providing anectodal evidences or narrative expressions plays a critical role in blockchain adoption. Accordingly, this research aims to an in-depth analysis of the blockchain in logistics and supply chain by investigating enablers, barriers, and risks of this adoption. To this end, through employing both the Methodi Ordinatio and the narrative network analyses, the future direction of blockchain adoption is presented in light of the presented current state of knowledge.

   abstract = {Family-owned businesses differ in their strategic intent and behavior as they serve as a reservoir of wealth and social status for their family owners. Family-owned businesses demonstrate relatively conservative strategic decision making that aspires long-term wealth preservation and enhancement. For family owners, investments in information technology (IT) raise a predicament as they are risky, yet a long-term imperative. We propose three hypotheses that build upon the thesis that family owners combine a deep understanding of the business with a strong influence on stakeholders within and beyond the firm’s boundaries to exert strategic control in the extended enterprise. First, family ownership negatively influences IT investment, because family owners are likely to avoid investments in IT that are frivolous, reduce information asymmetry, or leave auditable digital trails. Second, the negative influence of family ownership on IT investment is weakened when a career professional is appointed in the senior-most executive position of a family-owned business. This is because professional executives strive to utilize IT for control and performance benefits, and family owners desire to use IT to monitor and control the non-family professional executive. Third, family ownership weakens the negative influence of environmental hostility on the relationship between IT investment and firm performance, as family-owned businesses incur less dynamic adjustment costs and maintain better alignment between IT and business strategy. Empirical analysis, consisting of panel regression estimations, on archival data of publicly listed Indian firms in the years 2006 to 2018 provides support for our theory that highlights how IT for control acts as a noneconomic motivation for the strategic IT behavior of firms. In doing so, we bring family ownership into the theoretical foreground for future IS scholarship. We contribute to theory and practice by advancing the nature of ownership and executive management as sources of heterogeneity in IT investment and its business value.},

   abstract = {Digital platforms have transformed various industries, with profound changes witnessed in settings characterized by repeated, low value, and novel transactions, such as ride sharing, household services, and food delivery. Platform providers need to understand the factor(s) that suppliers consider before choosing to participate on their platforms. We argue that multi-level theorizing is necessary to explain the patterns of decision criteria that constitute the complex, yet boundedly-rational decision of platform participation. We draw on multiple theoretical perspectives which include predictors from firm-level strategic behavior, firm-level digital predictors, institutional predictors, and platform level, competition and contextual (environmental) predictors to model restaurant’s decision to participate on food delivery platforms, which are an exemplar of platforms that digitize transactions of ubiquitous and episodic nature. The population of 95,735 restaurants, serving a total of 135 different cuisines, located in the 37 largest cities of India, forms the dataset for developing our multi-level theory. Our decision tree induction methodology, which employs high levels of pruning, empowers us to discover context-specific rules that serve as credible approximations of the partial ordering of decision flows tacitly used by restaurants in deciding to participate on platforms. We identify six combinations of predictors, that is, decision rules, which are situated in at least four theoretical perspectives, to succinctly explain supplier participation on digital platforms. Finally, we abduct away from these specific decision rules to develop generalizable theoretical propositions. The decision trees, context-specific rules, general forms of the rules, and generalized propositions together form our multi-level theory for supplier participation on digital platforms. Our findings aid platform providers identify suppliers who can be the focus of efforts to increase platform participation, and help suppliers identify the participation status of competitors. For policymakers, our findings imply that incentives at the ends of the pricing spectrum can increase supplier participation on digital platforms.},

The package insert recommends that mirogabalin should be titrated depending on renal function. Here, we investigated the relationship between dose titration patterns and adherence, and persistence of mirogabalin treatment. Research design and methods: Peripheral neuropathic pain patients who initiated mirogabalin between March 2020 and May 2021 were identified using an electronic medical record database. The dose titration pattern was described according to degrees of renal function. Regression analyses were performed to compare adherence and persistence between the patients with and without titration. Results: Of the 4,138 identified patients, 1,696 (41.0%) titrated the dose within 45 days and were more adherent than those without titration (Adjusted odds ratio: 1.75, 95% CI 1.21, 2.54). Of the total 952 patients with renal function parameters, 229 (24.1%) titrated to the effective dose within 45 days and were less likely to discontinue than those without titration (Adjusted hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% CI 0.40, 0.81). Conclusion: Mirogabalin dose titration was associated with better adherence and persistence. It is important for mirogabalin treatment to determine the initial prescription dose based on renal function and subsequent dose titration according to the package insert.

We apply economic theory to explain the conditions under which business networks will exist and are able to sustain their value-producing activities. Informedness has the potential to increase the complexity of consumer demand.

It is necessary to determine strategic priorities and determine road maps using effective decision-making systems for a successful smart factory design (SFD) and transformation process. Likewise, one of the most significant obstacles to achieving a sustainable transformation is to systematically identify the requirements, challenges, and stages of this transformation. This study aims to create a framework for SFD and a road map with the strategic priorities by considering both opportunities and threats. For this aim, a multi-criteria decision-making methodology (MCDM) which consists of DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS methods by considering human knowledge-based data that converted by using Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) has been suggested for the problem solution. The highest importance criteria are determined as ‘Management’, ‘Operation’, ‘Structure’, ‘Organization’ for the main criteria and ‘Finance-Budget’, ‘Labor Force’, ‘Production Operations’, ‘Architectural Layer’, ‘Production Technologies’, ‘Smart Machine’, and ‘Integration’ for sub-criteria among the identified 7 main criteria and 30 sub-criteria, respectively. As a result, it has been determined that the strategy ‘Design and Automation of Processes’ is determined as the most appropriate strategy for the transition process of the SF among the 8 main strategies and 36 action plans. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is also performed, and the current situation and different scenarios are compared and discussed.},

   abstract = {Rapid developments in building information modeling (BIM) are escalating the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry toward digital transformation. However, the lack of skilled BIM professionals is a critical issue slowing this transformation. Currently, few educational institutions include BIM topics in their curricula, especially those developed for quantity surveying (QS) programs. Moreover, the learning outcomes of BIM curricula may not meet the current industrial requirements. Thus, this study investigated the current states, gaps, and challenges of BIM education for QS practices in Hong Kong. This study conducted surveys to determine industrial requirements and a case study to examine the BIM curricula currently offered at Hong Kong educational institutions. The results suggest that the current BIM education for QS practices is in line with the pace of BIM development in the AEC industry. However, some advanced topics are not covered in BIM education. Additionally, the non-standardized BIM competencies to be attained by students lead to uncertainty and challenges in BIM education for quantity surveyors.},

It is necessary to establish the scheme in order to identify the key characteristics that affect the degree to which management makes use of competitive intelligence. strategic management theory was adopted for this study. A “Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory” (DEMATEL) method was utilised in order to carry out an investigation into the most significant factors (features) that have an effect on CI. Four different businesses that had effectively implemented competitive intelligence strategies across a variety of business divisions were utilised as case studies in order to gain an understanding of the processes that underlie this new phenomenon. The finding of the research demonstrates that “Strategy Formulation” is the most influential dimension that can determine the degree to which management makes use of competitive intelligence. The study’s implication supports the idea that, in today’s highly competitive and digital environment, CI strategies require clear conceptualization, and this study focuses on the growing significance of this factor in facilitating the implementation of CI strategies. The results of the study provide more evidence that, in the highly networked and digital world of today, CI strategies are becoming an increasingly vital component for companies to implement through effective strategic formulation.},

Nevertheless, the question remains whether or not its adoption in production and logistics will transform the supply chain into a more agile one in developing countries context. Manufacturers are increasingly facing global competition to fulfil incoming orders within limited lead time, and in compliance with the international quality standards, also supporting a customised service. The emergence of industry 4.0 brought many promises to the leading firms. This research paper gives insight information for applying AI algorithms in production cycle then monitoring the production process and subsequently leading to strategic and tactical engineering decisions through the investigation of a number of case studies. The investigation demonstrates that incorporating AI technologies and machine learning opens up fresh perspectives on a variety of topics, including warehousing and logistics management, cooperation, and supply chain management. AI is embraced by business for productivity improvement, given the fact that the more AI adoption rate, the less employment rate and wages will be. Information & Communication Technology alignment model is endorsed in this paper in order to grant fostering of an environment that streamlines, incentivizes and supports AI expansion prior the implementation of any AI practices to ensure its successful and justified investments. The research concludes that the process is extremely challenging in the context of emerging economies which is restricted with low wages rate, inadequate labour skills and insufficient financial resources.},

Although the consumer psychology of luxury brands delves deep into the consumer’s perception, emotional value, and brand attachment, however, the influx of widespread digitization has changed the way consumers behave and the way the brands engage with the customers. Therefore, this study is an effort to explore the moderating impact of digital marketing on the relationship between the dimensions of luxury value (functional, individual, and social) and consumer luxury brand-related behavior. Following the survey-based data collection approach, a total of 214 workable responses were collected from the consumers of the luxury brands, located in north-eastern and central cities (Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad and Lahore) of Pakistan. The research results advocate the significant moderating influence of digital marketing on luxury value and consumer luxury brand-related behavior. Interestingly, the findings also revealed a substantial moderation of digital marketing on the insignificant relationship between the functional value and the consumer luxury brand-related behavior. The study contributes to the literature of digital luxury and consumer luxury brand-related behavior and provides critical insights to the marketers of luxury brands to effectively build brand perceptions while adapting to the digital transformation of luxury brands.},

Findings show that consumers feel ethical dissonance when recognizing that they have made uncivil online comments or have stood by while others did so. To alleviate the discomfort, they are likely to support a subsequent although unrelated environmental campaign. The effect is contingent upon whether the second message indicates that the advocated actions will benefit others or consumers alone. Specifically, ethical dissonance in one domain motivates consumers to adopt ethical behaviours in another domain, but only when the second domain appears to benefit others. In contrast, self-benefit appeals may cause ethical dissonance to backfire, so that consumers reject the subsequent environmental campaign. Mediational analyses show that heightened guilt (shame) drives the positive (negative) effects of other (self)-benefit appeals. Theoretical implications and ideas for future research are discussed.},

As a result, food product traceability, safety, and sustainability issues have become crucial concerns to food retailers, distributors, processors, and farmers. Digitalization allows food supply chains to be highly connected, efficient, and responsive to customer needs and regulation requirements. However, digitalizing a traditional food supply chain is challenging and resource demanding. This is more so for developing countries where moving food from farms to consumers can take months as it travels through an array of middlemen. Unfortunately, little is available in the existing literature on food supply chain digitalization. So far, current researchers mainly explore the benefits of digitalization. Using cases in three companies, this paper explores the practices, challenges, and opportunities faced by Thailand food manufacturers in digitalizing their food supply chains. A framework for food supply chain digitalization is proposed and its implications for research and practices are discussed.},

Survey data are from 501 consumers in Ghana and are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that engaging in CSR unquestionably improves all aspects of brand equity such as brand awareness, brand image, brand quality, and brand loyalty. We also find that the relationship between CSR and CBBE is moderated by CPV across all CSR-CBBE relationship. These findings have important implications for CSR, branding, international business and marketing in the Ghanaian marketplace.},

Drawing from the knowledge-based view and business logistic management framework, the objective of this study was to construct a framework that identifies and ranks existing and upcoming relevant knowledge domains and their sub-domains for maritime shipping executives. After reviewing the literature, five domains-digitalisation, maritime business, sustainability, personnel development, and supply chain management (SCM)-and 23 sub-knowledge domains were developed. Surveys were conducted with shipping company managers in Singapore and their responses were analysed using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process methodology. The results revealed that digitalisation knowledge was the most important, followed by maritime business, personnel development, sustainability, and SCM knowledge. Overall, this research has updated the knowledge and competency framework for maritime shipping executives, contributed to research on the interface between technology and knowledge management, and informed education strategies.

   abstract = {The current pandemic situation has forced organisations to adapt quickly and change processes through digital transformation. Businesses began to interact with consumers online and generally had to adjust existing processes and develop or improve the products and services offered. The agile transformation as part of Industry 4.0 started several years ago and in the current situation can be considered the best starting point for ongoing changes. The agile approach is mostly used in the field of IT, where it has penetrated mainly into software solutions and project management. Later, this concept began to penetrate deeper into several areas of the organisation, today we can talk about the company-wide transformation into an agile platform. While agility was initially perceived as a benefit, especially for software solutions, today it helps in successful business mainly by penetrating the organisational culture in which organisations define the desired values, ideas and procedures of employee behaviour in the organisation and is able to implement agile management principles. In the presented article, we present the results of research focussed on the analysis of the current state of application of agile management methods in companies operating in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The aim of this paper is to identify the approach to building an agile culture as a basic prerequisite for their effective implementation. The contribution of this article to agile management research is to identify specific aspects of agile culture that support agile management functioning. The size of the examined sample and the comparison of the results between the group of companies in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic provide findings with a high degree of reliability.},

This study focuses on the preconditions and benefits related to developing new ecosystem-based services around digital twins. As the digital twin business ecosystem is very complex and the goal of the research was to gain an in-depth knowledge in this field, the empirical evidence builds on qualitative data gathered from six case companies in the manufacturing sector. The results show that at the individual company level, the emergence of the ecosystems is determined by goal orientation and willingness to share information. The expected benefits are related to effective resource utilization, possibilities for co-learning, and new business creation. At the ecosystem level, forming a digital twin business ecosystem requires technical receptivity and common interests and goals among the members, as well as a strong customer-centric approach. At its best, a digital twin business ecosystem provides inter-organizational value for its members. This study provides new insights into developing new ecosystem-based services related to digital twins, both from the service provider and utilizer viewpoints. Further studies could broaden the implications by testing the relationships between specific preconditions and benefits at the company and ecosystem levels.},

It is, therefore, provocative to ask whether data can save healthcare systems from bankruptcy. Areas covered: We reviewed published examples in the search for the evidence on how the growing amount of data could change the way we used to assess the value of healthcare technologies, ensuring a more holistic approach in the decision-making process while reducing the waste in the healthcare. Expert opinion: The growing amount of data will continue to provide a multitude of valuable insights that can save healthcare systems from bankruptcy. Electronic medical records, IoT, wearables, and mobile applications generate constant data streams that can be utilized endlessly thanks to methodological advancements such as SNA, unsupervised and supervised machine learning, and natural language programming. However, interoperability across these multiple data sources still pose a challenge for the future development of data-driven healthcare. Already today however, decision makers can utilize Big Data to develop conditional coverage schemes for very expensive and complicated health technologies suitable for personalized healthcare. More advanced payers may utilize even data analytics even further and develop AI-based pricing schemes.},

It builds upon the lessons learned from the Digital Cities Challenge initiative, developed by the European Commission, designed to empower European cities to design and implement digital transformation strategies for the uptake of advanced digital services and the smart growth of city ecosystems. We study three cities that participated in the Digital Cities Challenge—Sofia, Granada, and Kavala—and provide an overview of the strategy designs they adopted. The results indicate that beside significant differences in context, sectors, and ecosystems targeted at those cities, common features shape the design of their digital transformation strategies based on digital platforms, such as opening markets for e-services, enhancement of local infrastructures, improving digital skills, and innovation funding mechanisms. We argue that creating digital platforms for ecosystem building is an essential strategy of digital transformation as it can produce network effects and externalities in digital space, similar to those deriving from spatial proximity in physical space. As a result, both spatial and digital network effects lead the development of externalities that play a key role in the formation, expansion, and sustainability of ecosystems.},

Baseline results show that digital transformation of enterprises can largely increase the pay gap. Mechanism tests show that the digital transformation of enterprises increases the income of executives and ordinary employees, and the income of executives is increasing faster than ordinary employees. Furthermore, employee’s skill level is an important influence mechanism of the effect of digital transformation on within pay gap. Heterogeneity analysis finds that this effect is more pronounced in firms with fierce industry competition, traditional firms, large firms, and firms with lower shareholdings of executives. Lastly, we find that the pay gap induced by digital transformation enhances corporate performance.

It is thus risky for parties to signal commitment to this emerging topic while other issues still dominate. Nevertheless, in recent elections several parties have given more space in their manifestos to digitization. To answer the question why this is the case, this paper stresses the role of costs and programmatic spill-overs in issue competition. It posits that parties emphasize digitization more in their manifestos if their costs for claiming competence on the issue are reduced due to a policy record in government; if parties have relatively more to lose from the status quo; and if digitization is compatible with their programmatic orientation. Evidence from an analysis of a select sample of eight Western European countries between 2010 and 2018 supports these expectations and sheds light on why parties invest into an emerging topic.},

   abstract = {The digital divide gained new importance since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemics. However, the phenomenon is far from being fully conceptualized or effectively measured. The key question, whether digital divide is a mere extension of other social inequalities, or it has significant new meaning, remains largely unanswered; a reason is the lack of effective instruments of quantitative study of the phenomenon that would capture its complex nature. The present paper addresses both conceptualizing and measurement issues, suggesting that separation of supply- and demand-side considerations is crucial in understanding the digital divide and introducing a composite Digital Life Index, measures separately the digital supply and demand across seven independent dimensions. The Index is based on Internet-borne data, a distinction from traditional research approaches that rely on official statistics or surveys. Though the empiric part of the paper is focused on the sub-national digital divide in Russia we argue that its methodology can be applied on many other levels and its conceptual findings are relevant to understanding the phenomenon globally. The hierarchical regression analysis is used to determine the relative importance of factors like income, human capital, and policy in shaping the digital divide. The result of the analysis suggests that the digital divide is driven more by the differences in demand than in supply; the role of income is insignificant, and the quality of policy and human capital is the key determinant of the divide. The paper advances the existing conceptual and methodological literature on the issue and can also inform practical decision-making regarding the strategies of national and regional digital development.},

Much of the scholarship on the transformation of the news media industry tends to focus on the phenomenon from the perspective of the journalist and how the process of journalism itself is changing. Often, however, this work overlooks how the process and labourers of newswork are more wholly affected. Thus, this paper argues for a reorientation of the categories of workers involved in the news media industry to account for those involved in media operations–those that play an active role in maintaining the infrastructure that physically creates and disseminates newspapers on a text by text basis. In order to achieve this goal, the paper seeks to uncover the newswork that occurs in the concealed world of media operations and then illustrates how changes to the industry are impacting this area of focus.

   abstract = {The current media environment demands a continuous stream of products ready to meet audience needs, and the emergent role of product manager serves to prioritize those needs by providing a holistic perspective on a news organization’s goals. Product managers meet a crucial business imperative of journalism by bringing new skillsets into the newsroom to help bridge the divide of the varying operating logics and align priorities among editorial, business, and technology departments. Thus, the increasing popularity of the product manager across news organizations serves as a prime example of the reengineering of journalism’s institutions. While much scholarship explains how journalism’s institutions evolve with regard to digital transformation, less focuses on the specific impact to the business of news and the role of actors as embedded yet still responsible for change. This article frames journalism’s product managers as institutional entrepreneurs to better understand how actors can promote change and reengineer journalism’s longstanding professional boundaries. A unique dataset of product manager employment histories from a sample set of news organizations in both the US and UK is systematically analysed to examine hiring patterns, training backgrounds, degree of professionalization, and organizational field structure, shedding light on the enabling conditions of institutional entrepreneurs.},

More specifically, the study targets changes in sports talk and interaction as producers re-shape their communicative activities to fit audiences’ new contexts of reception. It discusses how these changes in practices relate to some of the fundamental assumptions in current broadcast talk theory. The textual studies are complemented by interviews with six prominent Swedish media industry representatives in order to shed light on their perceptions of the broadcast to online shift given their respective experiences. The results show how producers/participants adapt to a more casual and relaxed interactional style and tone online than in ordinary broadcasting. The studied sportscasts also largely abandon the traditional broadcast address, as expressed in direct discursive address and looks-to-camera, for an orientation to screen devices where social media active audiences are to be “found,” although still having a traditionally positioned audience to attend to. Although sociability is still the structural principle for producers’ interactional choices irrelevant of platform, the strategies of how to achieve it are changing due to the digital transformation.},

Since the end of the Second World War, most supply chain systems for manufactured products have been based on ‘scale economies’ and ‘bigness’; in our paper we challenge this traditional view. Our fundamental research question is: how could a smart city production system change supply chain design? In answering this question, we develop an integrative framework for understanding the interplay between smart city technological initiatives (big data analytics, the industrial Internet of things) and distributed manufacturing on supply chain design. This framework illustrates synergies between manufacturing and integrative technologies within the smart city context and links with supply chain design. Considering that smart cities are based on the collaboration between firms, end-users and local stakeholders, we advance the present knowledge on production systems through case-study findings at the product level. In the conclusion, we stress there is a need for future research to empirically develop our work further and measure (beyond the product level) the extent to which new production technologies such as distributed manufacturing are indeed democratising supply chain design and transforming manufacturing from ‘global production’ to a future ‘city-oriented’ social materiality.},

Albeit EFL teachers’ positive attitude towards technology integration into language teaching, they may still lack guidance and support on how to implement mobile technologies in their teaching contexts. Based on these, a training model to integrate M-MALL into PST education was suggested. An M-MALL training program was developed for the purposes of the study based on the needs, related literature, and the gap stemming from the lack of training opportunities in PST education. 16 PSTs studying in an ELT Department in Turkey participated. Following the implementation of a systematic eight-week training, participants were asked to write reflections on the training they received. The PSTs, in general, reported positive views on receiving training. Receiving such thorough training resulted in many gains for the participants such as improvement in teaching skills, expanding perspective on effective mobile technology integration, and being up to date as a teacher.

Despite the progressive digital transformation in healthcare, it is still common for clinicians to analyse ECG printed on paper. Although some systems provide signal processing-based ECG classification, clinicians often find it unreliable. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming state-of-the-art for ECG processing but the lack of digitised ECG has hampered the clinical translation of these techniques. Concurrently, we are living a rise in augmented reality (AR) technologies, with an increasing availability of devices. In this work, we present an automatic digitisation and assisted interpretation of ECG based on an AI-enabled Augmented Reality headset. The AR headset is used to acquire an image of the printed ECG, from which the digitised ECG signal is extracted. Afterwards, the digitised ECG is introduced into a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm pre-trained on a public database of 12-lead ECG recordings. The output of the DL algorithm classifies the ECG signal onto different cardiomyopathy categories, which is then visualized back in the AR headset. Preliminary classification results on simulated ECG images (96.5% of accuracy) confirm the potential of the developed approach to contribute on the digital transformation of ECG processing.},

The enhancement of technology-based work environments has changed the skill set needed by graduates entering the workforce. In this regard, higher education institutions have shown signs of struggling to adapt curricula to prepare graduates with the skills needed by the fast-changing workforce environment. The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) developed a framework with competencies aimed to address the needed graduate skills, and for institutions to use as guiding documents in the amendment of their curricula. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the top universities in South Africa’s accountancy module documents to determine whether the curricula are addressing the 4IR workforce needs. The SAICA-proposed competency framework (2025CF) was used as a conceptual framework for the evaluation of the university’s curricula documents, and findings indicate that universities still need to make substantial changes in order to include newly-added pervasive skills as prescribed by 2025CF. Findings from the systematic literature review indicate that universities adequately address business acumen skills; however, the categories of digital-, relational and decision-making acumen were insufficiently evident within the current curricula of the top five South African universities. The apparent lack of specific skills development for graduates needs urgent attention considering the technological changes brought on by the 4IR within the accountancy domain.},

   abstract = {The choice of the characteristic value of a material property is fundamental in all civil engineering design and critical in geotechnical engineering. Based on our tradition, we strive to look for a cautious value, whose evaluation includes our engineering judgement. While the definition of a characteristic value is often given with the aid of statistics as a fractile value, its determination includes considerations of mechanics because “value” refers to the relevant quantity affecting the limit state. Soils are complex, often spatially heterogeneous and our knowledge of them is typically based on sparse incomplete data. This makes the definition and determination of a characteristic value for soils more multifaceted than for structural materials. This paper discusses the choice of the characteristic value for soils from various perspectives (statistical, mechanistic and practical) and summarises some recent findings to clarify the limitations of existing practice. Overly simplified statistical approaches may lead to unsafe or overly conservative designs. The authors conclude that a balance between practicality and incorporating salient features are needed. By increasing the value of data in design decisions, engineers will be motivated to collect, share, and utilise data as much as possible and bring our practice closer to the digital economy.},

This article analyzes Maturity Models (MMs) in Higher Education to identify the components of Education 4.0 that aim to achieve Society 5.0, seeking the dimensions and levels associated with the quintuple helix and the mission of the HEIs. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) guided by research questions to highlight studies that address Maturity Models worldwide, identify components of Education 4.0 in the MM, research methods and instruments used, internal and external stakeholders, and some characteristics of the university missions. The study method employed was a Systematic Review analyzing 26 articles from 2018 to 2023 found in WoS and Scopus databases using inclusion and exclusion criteria under a Prisma workflow. The findings were that the HEIs must: a) analyze dimensions of various Education 4.0 components in a balanced way, b) incorporate comparative designs and mixed methods of the MM models, c) provide technology transfer services, training, and data centers, d) provide fully open environments to educate all citizens inclusively, and e) use sustainable MMs for a significant difference in impact. This review offers educational leaders and policymakers the methodologies for measuring the Education 4.0 path to Society 5.0.},

A New Era is beginning where cultural organisations may face different challenges that emerged from the diffusion of digital technology. The digital revolution has pervaded and transformed not only various industrial sectors, but the whole of society. The most evident consequences are in terms of new forms of representation of cultural heritage, growing creative capacity and new market niches. This edited collection seeks to enlarge this debate with the aim of offering a wide discussion of topics related to the role of new technologies and innovation for cultural and creative sectors and organisations. In particular, the objective is twofold: (a) understanding new dynamics generated by digital transformation and how they may affect the cultural and creative industries and organisations; (b) identifying the new challenges in the development of new trajectories for cultural and creative sectors in the Digital Era.},

Research in economic business history has identified this period as crucial for the advent of the ‘Made in Italy’ label. The article aims to understand if and how the high fashion shows organized in Florence between 1951 and 1967 influenced the emergence of the Italian fashion industry and the concept of ‘Made in Italy’. Supported by data collected from the historical archive ‘Italian Fashion Archive of Giovanni Battista Giorgini’ and three online archives of digitalized books and newspapers, the analysis sheds light on the perception of the national and international press on the cultural phenomena of Italian fashion and ‘Made in Italy’. Results reveal an increasing trend in the frequency of terms related to the Italian fashion industry coinciding with the years of the Florentine events. The analysis evidences the crucial role of the entrepreneurial activity of Giovanni Battista Giorgini, buyer and organizer of the first Italian high fashion show in Florence, for the emergence of the Italian fashion industry and ‘Made in Italy’.},

Basing itself on cluster analysis, the study confirms the role of education in exploiting ICT in local tourism development. The disparity in the impact of ICT on outcomes is also explained, noting several reasons: (i) there is a delay in the effect of ICT application, and (ii) various influences depend on types of ICT. The results show that low percentile of tourism revenue provinces benefit the most from overall improvement in the use of ICT, while e-government applications further stimulate tourism revenue in provinces at higher ones. This finding implies that ICT application strategies must be appropriate for the local tourism context and emphasizes the role of improvement in the quality of ICT education.},

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of decision-making models evaluating the exact role of TPL providers as drivers for supply chain (SC) integration and optimisation. This study aims to develop a decision-making model for construction supply chain (CSC) optimisation, with possible TPL integration. The proposed model considers two types of purchased materials (type-1 and type-2) and assists the main contractor in determining construction supply chain management (CSCM) strategies, including supplier selection, order quantity determination, and TPL use evaluation. Using the model, the main contractor can take advantage of the TPL provider’s warehouse and order larger quantities, if necessary, to obtain lower prices offered by suppliers. Through case examples in Canada, we find that the proposed model performs better in optimising total SC cost, as compared to the model without TPL. Model validations also show that TPL can be conditionally used to improve construction logistics performance and to meet practical requirements targeting issues in the construction industry.},

Digital transformation, seen in the past as a problem, is now perceived as an important component in the future of sustainable development (SD), especially at higher education institutions whose operations have been adversely affected by the pandemic in many ways. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the subject matter of digital transformation and how it relates to a SD context. It reports on the results of a worldwide survey at higher education institutions, which identified some areas where the pandemic impacted and/or influenced their activities. The survey received 158 responses and a principal component analysis was performed to model the items associated with digital tools boosting SD, innovative business opportunities and ideas, and needs for improvement at HEIs. The results indicate that most part of the respondents developed digital skills and increased their involvement with e-learning and distance learning; however, more digital training is needed. Findings also support the role played by digital technologies in boosting SD at HEIs, and the role of institutions in promoting innovation through digital tools. Apart from an analysis of the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to digital transformation in an SD context in higher education institutions, the paper provides an assessment of trends and recommendations that may guide future developments in a post-pandemic work.},

Though some believe that the exponential pace of technological advancement will make traditional higher education obsolete and replace it with lifelong microlearning and upskilling models, research shows that what will empower future generations to thrive in the new age of machines is not up-to-date technical fluency but such distinctly human traits as creative problem-solving, critical thinking, cognitive flexibility, cultural agility, and emotional intelligence. The key to cultivating these soft ‘human’ skills, the paper contends, lies in liberal arts education. To illustrate how a well-designed liberal arts curriculum can develop the capacities demanded of the future workforce, the paper presents brief case studies of liberal arts programs in Singapore and China. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and policy directions for implementing liberal arts education in Korea’s higher education system.},

According to the panel data of A-share listed enterprises in the manufacturing industry from 2010 to 2020, we discuss how manufacturing enterprises allocate their financial assets in the process of digitalization from the perspective of operating profit and risk taking. The results reveal that ICT investment significantly reduces financial asset allocation, while digital transformation improves the financial asset allocation of manufacturing enterprises. Because ICT investment increases operating profit from the main business, manufacturing enterprises reduce the allocation of short-term and long-term financial assets. We thus propose two phenomena: precautionary saving and substitutional investment. As digital transformation increases risk taking, financial assets are elevated by manufacturing enterprises for the precautionary saving motivation, boosting the short-term financial assets in their portfolios. These findings are further supported by the heterogeneity of innovation characteristics and ownership.},

An e-government website is an essential communication platform that supports government-citizen interaction. The current research examines the relationship between e-government website evaluation and the variables indicative of the usage of e-government services (user satisfaction and intention to use) with basic social perceptions toward the government as the mediators using structural equation modelling. According to the stereotype content model (Fiske, 1993; Fiske et al., 2002), people form an impression of others based on two basic social dimensions (warmth and competence), and different levels of these dimensions determine how one forms attitudes and behaves toward the target. Our analysis confirms that both warmth and competence judgment function as crucial mediators for the relationship between e-government website evaluation and the intention to utilize e-government websites. This suggests that the government agency is not simply viewed as a service provider but also as a social entity that encompasses both warmth and competence from the perspective of citizens. By observing the aspects of website evaluation that are associated with the social dimensions, policymakers can strategically enhance citizens’ perception toward the government as well as their relationship with the government for the optimal operation of a country in a long-term perspective.},

Fifty older adults in South Korea participated in the 12-week IF program. First, older adults’ Internet usage patterns were examined. Using a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design with multiple outcome measures, we compared older mentees’ e-health literacy, technophobia, feelings of social isolation, and social capital following the IF classes. Our findings suggest that older adults’ adoption and employment of ICT skills improved their overall eHealth literacy and perceived usefulness of the Internet. Consequently, older IF participants with technophobia saw a decrease in anxiety, and an improvement in their confidence in using computer technology throughout the study period. Study findings imply that developing educational programs specifically designed for community dwelling elders with restricted access to ICT and little digital literacy is both desirable and feasible.},

In this paper, we draw on our experiences studying the labour of digital modelling work over the past 10 years to discuss some of the important social mechanisms through which models come to be trusted by stakeholders, and, consequently, integrated into innovation processes. By comparing three very different contexts we show that the work of trust-building requires modellers to create appeals to the credibility of the model’s analysis, the utility of its outputs, and to negotiate unavoidable political issues that emerge from differing values among parties in the innovation process. Revealing this labour positions models as social objects, and leads us to provide practical recommendations for scholars and practitioners who hope to use modelling as a key process for digital innovation.},

We develop a set of hypotheses and empirically test them using panel data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 21 to 2019. The fixed-effects panel data models serve as an estimation technique. Empirical results show that as performance falls below aspiration, the degree of enterprise digital transformation first increases and then decreases, as performance rises above aspiration, the degree of enterprise digital transformation first decreases and then increases. That is, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between negative performance feedback and enterprise digital transformation and a U-shaped relationship between positive performance feedback and enterprise digital transformation. Moreover, CEO openness significantly intensifies digital transformation in response to negative performance feedback, and industrial digitalization positively moderates the effects of positive performance feedback on digital transformation. Our findings highlight the importance of performance feedback on enterprise digital transformation, not only theoretically contributes to the research on digital transformation and behavioural theory, but also have notable implications for practice.},

This review aims to investigate how to leverage digital applications and automation across the healthcare industry to improve the quantity and quality of ADR reporting. Areas covered: This review investigated the significance of ADR under-reporting, the barriers of reporting ADRs, and the magnitude of success of various interventions to improve ADR reporting by searching the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases to include studies published between January 2000 and February 2022. This data was integrated with a view to describe a future ADR reporting framework. Expert opinion: Digital transformation has presented a significant opportunity with vast quantities of patient health data becoming available in electronic formats. The application of artificial intelligence to detect ADRs and then using automation to report these directly to regulatory agencies without human input would significantly enhance the quantity and quality of ADR reporting. Emphasis should be placed on ADRs identified for newly approved or black triangle medicines. Future studies are needed to measure the success of this ADR reporting framework in reducing the time taken to identify new safety issues and improving patient outcomes.},

The results show that border firms have a higher stock price crash risk than non-border firms. Mechanism tests find that border firms have lower available credit, higher financing costs, smaller fiscal subsidies, higher accrual earnings management, lower accounting conservatism, and a more positive tone in the management discussion and analysis section of the annual report. This indicates that resource shortages and aggressive information disclosure are important drivers of their higher stock price crash risk. Additional tests find no border effect in the borders of integrated areas or borders of areas adjacent to municipalities. Accelerating the digital transformation of the government and the information infrastructure construction, and strengthening external governance can partially alleviate the stock price crash risk of border firms.},

Correspondingly, five main-criteria and seventeen sub-criteria are identified. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied to rank the CSFs based on the feedback from experienced managers and directors working in maritime shipping companies. The findings show that in descending order of importance, the top five sub-criteria of blockchain implementation are relative advantage, internal leadership, human resources capability, scalability and ease of use. This study has provided a novel theoretical framework for blockchain CSFs research, offered strategy formulation in relation to marketing, technological skills upgrade, investments and subsidization, and knowledge cluster sharing to support blockchain implementation in the maritime industry.},

   abstract = {As industries take advantage of the widely adopted digitalization of industrial control systems, concerns are heightened about their potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. False data injection attack is one of the most realistic threats because the attack could be as simple as performing a reply attack allowing attackers to circumvent conventional anomaly detection methods. This attack scenario is real for critical systems, e.g., nuclear reactors, chemical plants, etc., because physics-based simulators for a wide range of critical systems can be found in the open market providing the means to generate physics-conforming attack. The state-of-the-art monitoring techniques have proven effective in detecting sudden variations from established recurring patterns, derived by model-based or data-driven techniques, considered to represent normal behavior. This paper further develops a new method designed to detect subtle variations expected with stealthy attacks that rely on intimate knowledge of the system. The method employs physics modeling and feature engineering to design mathematical features that can detect subtle deviations from normal process variation. This work extends the method to real-time analysis and employs a new denoising filter to ensure resiliency to noise, i.e., ability to distinguish subtle variations from normal process noise. The method applicability is exemplified using a hypothesized triangle attack, recently demonstrated to be extremely effective in bypassing detection by conventional monitoring techniques, applied to a representative nuclear reactor system model using the RELAP5 computer code.},

First, the relationship between existing maturity models and dynamics capability is investigated. The finding indicates that most maturity models cannot identify an organisation’s dynamic capability or examine this capability in a dynamic and competitive environment during the transition. On the basis of the literature and senior executives’ experiences, this study incorporates dynamics capability into the maturity model assessment developed by the Singapore Economic Development Board for empirical analysis and identification of the importance of key capabilities with influencing factors, which are included in a framework to fill the research gap. Primary data obtained from in-depth interviews are systemically examined to determine the industrial maturity level and dynamics capability driving the transformation. Drawing on this investigation, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for smart manufacturing transformation driven by dynamic capabilities that have positive effects on the transformation of manufacturing enterprises. Our main contribution is identification of the four key aspects of dynamic capability–process, technology, organisation, and transformation. Another contribution is that we provide dynamic capability-based guidance for enterprises to re-evaluate their strategies and strengthen the capabilities they require to face a changing environment.},

The study relies on survey and interview data and addresses whether pupils perceive their participation in computer-based adaptive tests as contributing to their learning and the degree to which the perception of teachers’ attitude to the test influences their learning. A majority perceives their learning as low or non-existing. However, the perception of a more positive teacher attitude is related to more substantial learning. Theoretically, we attribute this relationship to the effect of self-fulfilling prophecies in the classroom. Learning also differs for subgroups related to gender and ability level.

Identifying the right sources for a specific research question within this field is not easy or straightforward. Yet Holocaust scholars predominately focus on methodologies for source analysis rather than discovery. Archival finding aids are among the most important tools to aid primary source discovery, but have hitherto not been considered in methodological discussions on Holocaust research. In this article we will reflect on the composition of finding aids based on our work for the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI). Our premise is that the content of finding aids is determined by their authors and the context in which they are creating them. The strongest argument for this subjectivity is that our work–outlined in this article–not only indicates that descriptions of one and the same source differ, but that they can do so quite considerably, and hence can influence research. Our stance is that historians optimize their profit from finding aids by becoming more sensitive to the subjectivity and authorship of descriptions. We conclude by showing how an online environment such as the one developed by EHRI can sensitize historians and archivists to the situated and subjective nature of finding aids by accommodating a plurality of descriptive voices, and encourage them to share their knowledge and become co-authors of finding aids.},

We conduct an empirical prestudy with 52 German farmers to investigate current data sharing scenarios. From these insights, we derive requirements and a concept for data sharing solutions providing data flow transparency for users. To investigate the behavior of users and the effects of transparent UI controls, we evaluate a prototype with 18 persons. Our evaluation shows that farmers demand flexible and secure tools that adjust to their workflows. Also, data should be stored and processed locally, granting farmers data sovereignty. Although the controls require additional effort, the evaluated transparent controls for data disclosure are easy to use and raise user awareness.},

In this study, we examined the impact of the 2016 Chinese Environmental Protection Tax Law (EPTL2016) on energy-intensive firms’ financial performance and explored the role of digital transformation using panel data from Chinese A-share-listed companies. Using the difference-in-differences method, we found that the EPTL2016 has significantly improved energy-intensive firms’ financial performance by incentivizing their digital transformation but has at the same time moderated the economic benefits of digital transformation. Moreover, state-owned enterprises have been more effective at improving their financial performance through digital transformation under the pressure of the EPTL2016. From a regional perspective, the EPTL2016 has enhanced energy-intensive firms’ financial performance primarily through digital transformation in regions with better digital infrastructure, and through green transformation in regions highly dependent on resource and in regions with stricter environmental governance.},

By giving localities broader financial autonomy, local governments are incentivized to target the “pain points and blockages” in financial services to the real economy, thus having a significant impact on the development and transformation of micro enterprises. Based on micro data of A-share listed manufacturing enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010–2021, this paper uses the double difference method (DID) to explore the impact of the establishment of a comprehensive financial reform pilot zone on the digital transformation of micro manufacturing enterprises and its mechanism. The results found that the pilot zone of comprehensive financial reform significantly improved the digitalization of manufacturing enterprises. Specifically, it effectively promotes the digital transformation of enterprises by reducing their financing costs and promoting their physical investment levels. In particular, it has had a stronger positive impact on the digital transformation of non-state-controlled enterprises, competitive enterprises, and labor-intensive and technology-intensive manufacturing enterprises. The results of the present study can provide a reference experience for other regions to carry out financial reforms to serve the transformation and upgrading of enterprises.},

Enterprises are increasingly relying on industrial Internet platforms to satisfy potential customers’ needs as well as to create superior value, but the literature has neglected to explain how enterprises can leverage such digital platform to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of servitization. This study aims at describing how the industrial Internet platform can enable servitization of manufacturers. Based upon the meta-theoretical foundations of service-dominant logic, we identify the ‘sense and respond’ servitization strategy enabled by the industrial Internet platform. By performing a questionnaire survey, we find that the industrial Internet platform approach based on the connectivity and compatibility architecture can enable manufacturers to improve the efficiency of resource integration and resource reconfiguration, which facilitates the implementation of servitization via market perception. We argue that the industrial Internet platform affects an organisation’s ability to sense the market and resource management actions; these operational resource actions are a significant antecedent of the servitization strategy.},

The additional analysis showed that firms can alleviate the negative impact of high-temperature weather by increasing employee compensation, and carrying out digital transformation. High-temperature weather prompts firms to reduce the number of blue-collar occupations and increase the number of white-collar occupations.

It is a sector subject to a high number of legislative, economic, social, technological and environmental changes. Such changes have a secondary influence on the expectations, values and therefore preferences and job satisfaction of employees. The objective of this contribution is to identify the development of the motivational preferences of employees in the transport and logistics sector over time. These changes are monitored within the context of key changes and the strategic direction of the sector. The achievement of the objective is based on the partial results of research conducted by means of a questionnaire survey (n = 3,543) on motivational preferences and job satisfaction within the field. The ANOVA test and Tukey’s HSD test were used for the verification of the hypotheses. The results show that employee preferences are changing significantly, with the most significant increase being identified in the case of social factors (environmental approach, corporate vision and regional development), reflecting current green innovation trends in the sector. Also, employees perceive education and professional growth, self-realisation, competencies, corporate prestige, physical and mental demands, content and type of work, working hours and environment and such feedback on results as increasingly important. On the other hand, there is declining emphasis on basic salary.},

Education has been identified as instrumental for the digital transformation of Swedish society, and efforts are made to accelerate the digitalization of the educational system. As governments’ demands for digitalization get increasingly loud and persuasive, it is important to critically explore what values and ideologies are embedded in the argumentation. In this study, we use Critical Discourse Analysis to examine the Swedish Digitalization Commission’s report ‘For digitalization with the times’. Our results demonstrate that the policy argumentation, despite being anchored in traditional Swedish welfare values, is characterized by a coherent and reductionist neoliberal framing of education. Students are represented as self-managing entrepreneurial citizens with a moral obligation to renew their human capital and adapt to market demands, while the educational system is constructed as a flexible, largely automated, infrastructure for ‘life-long learning’, in which teaching is reduced to ‘facilitating’. We suggest that such discourses around education in Swedish policy rest upon three preconditions: digitalization as an interconnective policy object, Swedish digitalization policy making as soft governance, and the Swedish welfare model as susceptible to discursive drift.},

The manufacturer may engage in selective information sharing, making demand or cost information accessible to one supplier but concurrently withholding the same information from a second, complementary input supplier. Information sharing to the second supplier is intermediate whereas concealment is two-tailed. Selective information sharing arises because in light of component interdependencies the disclosure strategy causes two competing forces–lowering one component's costs versus increasing the other's costs.},

This article presents the study carried out in Leiria region (Portugal) to define VET areas priorities at the secondary education level. A mixed methodology was applied by using both quantitative (employment microdata, employers survey and employment offers analysis) and qualitative (interviews, focus groups and documents analysis) instruments and techniques. A diverse group of stakeholders (e.g. regional policymakers and private and public sectors’ employers) were heard in order to anticipate the market’s needs for skills. The results, obtained through the various methodologies, point to the same skills’ priorities and reveal several mismatches between demand and supply of qualifications. Thus, this study helps policymakers to prioritize areas of education and VET providers to design courses aligned with the real needs of the region’s labour market. Additionally, several challenges are identified, as the need of a better dialogue between the VET system and employers. By increasing the quality of VET supply, our policy suggestions contribute to reduce future demand-supply imbalances, and therefore, to reduce unemployment, control the demographic problem, increase the companies’ expansion and promote regional development.},

   abstract = {Research demonstrates that digital technologies stimulate industrial transformation by enabling new interdependencies with firms outside and across firm and industry boundaries. However, we know little about the degree of novelty and breadth of digital technologies that have the potential to transform industries. Understanding the degree of novelty (spanning from radical to incremental) and breadth (spanning from one sector to multiple sectors) of digital technologies is important for measuring their impact on industrial transformation. Through a topic modelling research approach on autonomous vehicle technology patents from firms operating in Sweden and a confirmatory survey with the inventors of those patents, this paper reveals 26 digital technology topics that are transforming the automotive industry. The digital technology topics are distributed across four ideal-typical technology categories for transformation: augmenting, spanning, transforming, and disrupting. This study illustrates the value of studying digital technologies’ transformative nature using an integrating framework; it reveals that digital technologies in the automotive industry have mainly incremental characteristics but that these characteristics provide necessary preconditions for the few more radical technologies to achieve their potential in transforming the industry.},

While previous research proposes a complementary, tight alignment between the CDO and the Chief Information Officer (CIO), role redundancies and the fight for recognition and resources also suggest an inherent tension. We provide insights into the CIO-CDO collaboration quality based on role, TMT cooperation, conflict theory, and a dyadic design approach of 11 CIO-CDO relationships with 33 expert interviews in two waves. Our findings indicate that the CIO-CDO relationship may not always be as complementary as proposed in the literature; instead, in the vast majority of our dyads, there is too much role conflict to achieve tight alignment, leading to separation behaviour between the roles. We identify the involvement in the introduction of the other role, the CIO demand-side orientation, and the CDO supply-side orientation as important contingency factors determining the quality of the CIO-CDO relationship. Finally, unless the CIO-CDO relationship resembles a perfect match, a unified Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) role may better resolve the challenges we identify in our sample’s dyads. Our insights extend the understanding of the CIO-CDO relationship.},

This article investigates the speed of green technology diffusion in China using a unique data set, which lists geocoded patent licence agreements for green technologies from 2000–2019. We focus on the relation between spatial determinants, including geographic proximity and regional technological specialisation, and the time-to-adoption, thus analysing the factors explaining the time between technology development (patent application) and technology adoption (licencing). The main finding is that geographic proximity to the innovator is associated with an accelerated time-to-adoption. Moreover, we find that the more a region specialises in green technologies, the faster a patent is licenced within that region.},

   abstract = {In the digitisation development of economy, logistics is of central importance due to the linkage of information and material flow throughout supply chains. However, verifiable effects in terms of efficiency have not been empirically shown in many cases yet. Therefore, this paper develops an efficiency analysis to evaluate the impact of changing levels of digitalisation. An efficiency-centred cross-sectional approach uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for assessing the performance of 60 truck drivers, as well as Malmquist productivity index for longitudinal analysis of 50 truck drivers between 2012 and 2018. The results of the DEA model indicate that a change in the level of digitalisation entails a loss of the efficiency level in the first instance, which can be compensated and even surpassed later. Findings of the Malmquist model prove positive long term effects of several digitalisation steps on transport logistics efficiency. As the proposed methodologies only allow an a posteriori evaluation for the impact of digitalisation, we develop an a priori simulation approach, based on empirical DEA results, statistical bootstrapping and regression analyses. Both approaches allow logistics researchers and managers to achieve a better understanding regarding the success or failure of digital transformation scenarios from an efficiency perspective.},

Hence, this study aims to explore the current state of Facebook usage among civil engineering undergraduate students. Data was collected through a questionnaire survey. Results of questionnaire discovered that Facebook usage among civil engineering students could be categorized into four groups, namely: ‘Fulfill basic needs of psychological health’, ‘Personal enhancement/life long learning’, ‘Maintaining social connectivity’ and ‘Engaging for academic achievement’. In conclusion, Facebook is a viable and preferable choice of a learning and teaching platform among younger generations.

Content analysis of interviews in Finland (Yleisradio [Yle]), Germany (Norddeutscher Rundfunk [NDR] and Radio Bremen [RB]), and Sweden (Sveriges Television [SVT]) clarifies correspondence and contradictions among strategic managers of legacy mass media firms as they struggle to adapt their organisations to the demands of today’s digital media environment. Findings indicate continuing commitment to legacy public service ideals that are perceived as beneficial but also pose complications in fulfilling the universal service mission’s historic mission today.

The number of connected devices is projected to be 28 Billion in 2025, and our expectations on digitalization set new requirements of mobile communication technology. To handle the increased amount of connected devices and data generated, the next generation of mobile communication technology is under deployment: 5G-technology. The manufacturing industry follows the digital transformation, aiming for digitalized manufacturing with competitive and sustainable production systems. 5G-technology meets the connectivity requirements in digitalized manufacturing, with low latency, high data rates, and high reliability. Despite these technological benefits, the question remains: Why should the manufacturing industry invest in 5G-technology? This study aims to determine the impact of 5G-technology on manufacturing performance; based on a mixed-methods approach including a modified TOPSIS method to ensure robustness of the results. The results show that 5 G-technology will mainly impact productivity, maintenance performance, and flexibility. By linking 5G-technology to the performance of the manufacturing system, instead of focusing on network performance, the benefits of using 5G-technology in manufacturing become clear, and can thus facilitate investment and deployment of 5G-technology in the manufacturing industry.},

However, digital participatory financing in Europe, with a different regulatory context and relevant public funding, has been investigated less. This article analyses the effects of an innovative and digital-native electoral campaign financing tool: the microcredit. Microcredits consist of small “civil loans” that a political party requests from sympathizers to finance the party's electoral campaign. Based on the case study of the Spanish party Podemos–the first one to implement it–for the period of 2015–2021, we use official data and party documents to explore the consequences of microcredit. We argue, first, that microcredits (and party financing) should be considered another way to differentiate challenger parties from traditional ones. Second, there is a link between the number and amount of microcredits and the political context, not limited to good electoral expectations but also to the polarized political context. Third, microcredits change the structure of campaign funding. Finally, we point out a regulation problem that may deter other parties from adopting this mechanism and present different legal problems (monitoring, data protection, or potential corruption), showing the regulatory issues for adapting to the digitalization of politics.},

The underlying SBRAI classification schema is well-understood, but given the potentially serious ethical consequences of misjudgments, there is a lack of understanding of how a newly introduced IT artefact, or digital transformation, affects the overall process. Applying a value-centric lens and using Value Sensitive Design (VSD), we identify users’ most relevant SBRAI values, as well as the existing value tensions between developers and users. We find that various value tensions, which had not been an issue prior to digitization, occur. These are tensions regarding the values traceability, reliability, neutrality, support, and trust. These value tensions often emerge due to misunderstandings and miscommunications that unclear classifications enable. Practitioners should therefore focus on four design guidelines to avoid SBRAI value tensions: constant and accessible information, transparency, isolated use anticipation, and compliance with novice and expert users’ requirements.},

   abstract = {Although the term Operational Excellence (OE) has been widely applied over the past few decades, its meaning is still ill-defined. This issue may be especially aggravated after the advent of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0), which introduces disruptive digital technologies that may help to overcome traditional barriers in operations management. This paper examines the concept of OE in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. For that, we conducted semi-structured interviews with experts from both academia and manufacturing companies, focusing on the shifts in OE's concepts implied by the I4.0 with regards to four key aspects (people, partnerships, processes, and products and services). Experts’ responses had their content analysed through the lens of General Systems Theory, which allowed the formulation of propositions towards the conceptualization of OE in the digital transformation era. Our findings indicated that, although some attributes may remain the same, the emphasis of OE in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is likely to change. The extensive integration of digital technologies into manufacturing companies tends to entail different expectations in terms of excellence in people, partnerships, processes, and products and services. As interconnectivity and cyber-physical systems gain prominence, a more integrative and systemic perspective of OE is facilitated, expanding its meaning and understanding.},

Improving energy efficiency is the key to achieving stable and sustainable economic growth and carbon emissions reduction. However, the impact of the digital economy on energy efficiency remains unclear. Accordingly, this study examines the relationship between the digital economy and energy efficiency from the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) perspective. In doing so, this study confirms that the digital economy follows the EKC in energy utilization efficiency, and there is a U-shaped relationship between the digital economy and energy efficiency, although this relationship differs from one region to another. This study also discusses the moderating effects of environmental regulation and innovation capability in this U-shaped relationship, confirming that they have a moderating effect on this relationship, reducing the inflection point of the U-shaped relationship, and reducing the negative influence of the digital economy on the energy efficiency and enhancing the positive impact. This study can serve as a reference for policymakers and professionals in emerging economies, helping them achieve a win-win situation for economic development and reducing carbon emissions.},

RIM Systems collect, store, and link together metadata for research, service, grants, and teaching activities. Sometimes called Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) or Faculty Activity Reporting (FAR), these systems enable institutions to collect data from different internal systems and combine it with external information, providing a more holistic perspective on university activity. They provide a single, authoritative source of this data and allow for multiple stakeholders (i.e. faculty, administration, IT, HR, library, communications) to query, analyze, download, visualize, and share it. Oklahoma State University (OSU) recently adopted a RIM System, which is being implemented and supported by the OSU Libraries. A defining factor in the decision making process for product selection was how each system addressed issues around privacy. This case study will review some of the central data privacy considerations at play in the adoption of RIM Systems at both the institutional and individual level. This will include data sharing, ownership, retention, right to reuse data, data deletion obligations upon contract termination, user access to privacy policies, and user data controls. Questions to ask before adoption, key institutional players in discussions of privacy, and issues that may arise after adoption of a Research Information Management System will also be addressed.},

OL is a driver of firms’ competitive advantage and performance, yet this symbiotic relationship has not been adequately explored in most developing countries. It is against this backdrop that the current study aims to develop a baseline model in the context of a low- and middle-income country to explain the extent to which OL dimensions impact firms’ competitive strategy and performance. Our article utilizes a quantitative research approach and deductive reasoning. Cross-sectional survey data have been collected from small and medium enterprises across manufacturing, hospitality, extraction, transportation, construction, and oil and gas subsectors. Our data have been analyzed using the structural equation modelling technique. The study has revealed that OL dimensions of knowledge acquisition, knowledge distribution, and knowledge interpretation have positive and significant impacts on firms’ competitive strategy and performance. Moreover, competitive strategy significantly and positively mediates the relationship between OL dimensions and firm performance. The theoretical implications of the study include the development of a baseline model to explain the extent to which OL dimensions impact firms’ competitive strategy and performance in the context of lower-middle-income countries, where such studies are largely inadequate. Practically, this study is among the very few to present contextual determinants of firm competitive strategy and performance to guide investors and business owners in attracting, retaining, and transferring knowledge in order to formulate fierce strategies.},

Our study incorporates the DT technologies with an implementation case study on FPC and accomplishes the real-life problem of the food processing company (FPC). Moreover, the proposed DT research framework demonstrates the various DT implementation stages, such as strategic mapping and physical-virtual space replica, with rigorous analysis. The results show that DT enhances the existing system’s machine availability, allocation efficiency, technical efficiency, worker efficiency, utilization rate, effectiveness, step ratio, and throughput rate.

   abstract = {Several studies have been conducted on education in the discourse of offender rehabilitation; however, little has been published on the nexus between offender eLearning and re-entry into a digital society. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature on offender education focusing mainly on eLearning to explain how offender eLearning enables re-entry, reduces recidivism, and promotes a better post-release life. The review draws on the good lives model (GLM) of offender rehabilitation and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Both theories acknowledge the paradox of digital inclusion in offender rehabilitation. We found that online education, facilitated by digital platforms, is a chance for offenders to learn new information and develop their abilities, presuming that the demand for education and training in prisons must be comparable to that of traditional educational institutions. Digital prison education gives inmates a purpose for their time in imprisonment as well as prepares them for life after prison. We conclude that technology cannot replace good teaching in offender rehabilitation; it can only support it. Moreover, the mere presence of the most innovative, mobile, user-friendly technology will not improve access and outcomes if the users on the ground do not have the time, space, resources, energy, and motivation to engage it. We, therefore, recommend that the technology for offender rehabilitation must be highly contextualized to ensure the long-term accomplishment of eLearning initiatives aimed at non-traditional and isolated students.},

Design thinking has been one of these sought-after innovation approaches in recent years. Design thinking has produced remarkable results in creative firms such as design consultancies, but its implementation in large, established firms has proven to be far more challenging, especially if a strong company culture contradicts the philosophies underlying design thinking. One possible answer to this challenge lies in adapting an innovation approach such as design thinking to its new environment so it can truly take hold. We describe how a large, technology-driven firm proceeded in morphing the design thinking approach to allow it to take root in different parts of the company and over time become an integral part of the firm’s innovation activity.},

The focus is limited to three key emerging trends this development is seeing; Big Data, cloud computing and 3D printing. This study is carried out through a literature review and empirical findings from a series of interviews, and an explorative survey. The literature review identified a substantial difference in compatibility between industry level and the digital transformation Supply Chain 4.0 implies. Empirical findings showed that among the investigated trends, 3D printing was considered to have a major impact on Supply Chain 4.0. Its use though has been limited due to uncertainty among the supply chain stakeholders about its true added value in a cost/benefit perspective. Moreover, multinationals showed a strong preference for Big Data implementations, but only had limited focus on cloud computing applications.

To address this issue, we identify and examine the processes through which IT may create or impair business value in service processes.

Drawing on the findings, we present implications for IT strategy research and discuss in particular how firms can avoid unexpected value destruction when they increase customer participation in the delivery of online services to create value.},

As cities face daily political issues deriving from globalisation (such as mass tourism, migration, climate change, and commodification of culture), they demand for, rather than contesting with a nationstate, an operational reinterpretation of sovereignty oriented to solve problems. Political economy approach is a useful method to understand the role of global cities where the nation state has many deficiencies. The global city establishes rules to influence international legal development and practice, even without a traditional legal basis (such as sovereignty, monopoly on violence, and legal exclusivity). As these ‘superstar cities’ grow, other cities are losing opportunities to develop and take advantage of globalisation. The risk of inter-urban inequality feeds populism.

The Big Data Analytics (BDA) expertise of management and personnel, as well as the Supply Chain (SC) resilience dimensions of preparedness and agility are considered in this research. This study tests five main hypotheses using data obtained from an empirical survey collected from 128 Emirati companies, which were analysed through the partial least square method of structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3.2. The measurement model created was reflective and contained a total of 31 construct indicators. The results showed that the construct of ‘big data analytics capability of planning' as demonstrated by expertise of Emirati companies in the UAE management has a significantly positive influence on SC preparedness. In addition, SC preparedness has a direct, positive influence on SC agility which are preparedness for the companies towards digital transformation initiative in the UAE. The study will be helpful for the logistics industry of the UAE and worldwide to understand the need and importance of the BDA aspects and related capability planning for business resilience at times of such global pandemic.},

This paper proposes a novel design framework that uses Federated learning-Artificial intelligence (FAI) for decision-making and Smart Contract (SC) policies for process execution and control in a completely automated smart automobile manufacturing industry. The proposed design introduces a novel element called Trust Threshold Limit (TTL) that helps moderate the excess usage of embedded equipment, tools, energy, and cost functions, limiting wastages in the manufacturing processes. This research highlights the use cases of AI in decentralised Blockchain with smart contracts, the company’s trading policies, and its advantages for effectively handling market risk assessments during socio-economic crisis. The developed model supported by real-time cases incorporated cost functions, delivery time and energy evaluations. Results spotlight the use of FAI in decision accuracy for the developed smart contract-based Automobile Assembly Model (AAM), thereby qualitatively limiting the threshold level of cost, energy and other control functions in procurement assembly and manufacturing. Customisation and graphical user interface with cloud integration are some challenges of this model.},

One of the most critical elements in this regard is the industry's implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies. In this study, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making model, named ConFIRM, to measure the strategic readiness of construction firms concerning Industry 4.0 implementation. The existing literature proposed some models to evaluate the maturity towards Industry 4.0. However, no model has yet been proposed that evaluates strategic readiness. Also, none focused on the construction industry. ConFIRM is a five-stage model where the modified AHP-TOPSIS technique was used to assess the readiness level. The model was evaluated and quantified using a panel of experts from the Malaysian construction industry. The results indicated that the human capital component is the most critical factor affecting the success of Industry 4.0 implementation. Specifically, the intellectual agility, knowledge, skills, and competencies of the construction professionals. Consequently, a case study was used to test the utilisation of the proposed model. Moreover, recommendations to enhance the readiness level were concluded from the readiness model.},

This account provides an opportunity to strengthen the deployment of smart services and digital technologies that enhance student engagement. Developed countries have integrated virtual and physical systems to support education and industrial processes while developing countries such as Zimbabwe seem to be lagging. Government and funding organisations for higher education institutions have expressed interest in clear strategies that encompass student engagement in their policies and activities. The study focused on developing an app that enhanced student engagement aspects related to off-the classroom activities such as voting for leaders, sports and social activities. The study employed design science research methodology, a paradigm used for the development of artefacts that are aimed at solving real-world problems. A user-centred design methodology was adopted to guide the app development process as it enhances user acceptance. A total of 220 participants successfully evaluated the app through a questionnaire. The results of the evaluation revealed that the app was usable, easy to learn, and they would recommend it to others and agreed that they could use the app with no assistance. The results show that the app promoted student engagement and promoted concepts of a smart town. These results will help policymakers and educators to refine the app features and content to improve student engagement. Recommendations proffered can help researchers to explore how mobile apps can be used to promote smart-university towns.},

This study presents a conceptual framework that classifies H4.0 digital technologies into information and communication technology bundles within the healthcare value chain. It also identifies barriers and evaluates digital technologies’ impact on quality measures through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis approach following the PRISMA protocol. The analysis reveals that digital technologies in the healthcare sector traditionally consist of sensing-communication and processing-actuation technologies. The findings highlight the significant influence of H4.0 digital technologies on three quality measures: patient safety, patient experience/satisfaction, and clinical effectiveness. While these technologies offer potential benefits, they pose challenges for patients and clinicians, including intellectual property and significance concerns, especially in North America. The proposed framework addresses these issues and enables stakeholders to prioritize, review, and analyze H4.0 digital technologies to enhance patient safety, experience, and clinical effectiveness. This research contributes to the existing literature by being the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of H4.0 technologies on the quality of care. The framework provided in this study offers valuable guidance for stakeholders in selecting appropriate technologies to improve patient outcomes and support the healthcare value chain.},

This conceptual model combines an adapted business model canvas and system dynamics modeling using an up-to-date review. The studies used in this systematic review were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases between 2010 and 2021. The total number of publications in all databases was 422. However, following an in-depth investigation of these publications, 164 papers were selected for further review. Based on the business model canvas, the interactions between different business dimensions and the impact on environmental stakeholders were examined. Finally, a dynamic, sustainable business model canvas is conceptualised and developed. The findings suggest that the proposed system dynamics business modeling approach can frame the environmental, social, and economic drivers of value creation in a causal feedback structure and overcome the gaps and criticisms of existing business model design tools.},

Based on text analytics techniques applied to a sample of more than 50,000 TripAdvisor ORs covering 35 international hotels in Asia and America, we develop a penalty–reward contrast analysis. The findings reveal that the effects of customer interaction with mechanical AI on customer satisfaction with service operations are asymmetric: positive customer interaction with mechanical AI positively and significantly influences overall customer satisfaction with AI-empowered service operations, whereas negative customer interaction with mechanical AI does not significantly alter customer satisfaction. Taken together, these findings suggest that mechanical AI constitutes a key element of resilient AI-empowered service operations.},

These are some of the reasons that have fostered the development and diffusion of new working spaces like coworking spaces. The paper aims at exploring the location determinants of coworking spaces, an issue that has been less developed by the literature up to now. By focusing on the 549 coworking spaces located in Italy at the year 2018, the paper investigates the location factors of such workplaces, and the attractiveness of large cities as well as peripheral areas. The results of the descriptive statistics and the econometric analysis (a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model is applied) confirm that coworking is mainly an urban phenomenon, since coworking spaces tend to be knowledge-intensive places for creative people. Specifically, the municipalities showing higher innovation and entrepreneurial environment (i.e. major cities) are preferred locations. Besides, it is discussed whether coworking spaces may contribute to fostering the development of peripheral and inner areas in Italy, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic where the share of teleworkers outside metropolitan areas has massively increased.},

   abstract = {Governments have been promoting policies for fostering innovation and economic growth through processes of digital transformation in different sectors over the last decade. Referring to the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) industry, public administrations (PAs) have been trying to comply with legal requirements by exploiting cutting-edge digital tools and innovative methods such as Building Information Modelling (BIM). Compared to traditional methods and technologies, this process can boost project management by increasing collaboration among stakeholders, providing enhanced facility visualisation and reducing errors. Although its strategic benefits are widely recognised, the lack of technical skills and the strong attachment to old standards of operation have hindered its adoption, especially in the Italian context. Thus, there is a great need to push PAs towards a change of mentality and processes and check their adoption. After collecting data through literature review and interviews, this research aims to define an operational framework that supports PAs to implement and check the digitalisation of their workflows for the design phase. The framework consists of three consecutive milestones, including acquisition, modelling and verification. The framework is based on an iterative process, which is in common among the three identified milestones. For each of these milestones, a set of key performance indicators was defined to assess the implementation. Indicators were developed by exploiting five-point-based levels and addressing focal points for implementing digital systems. Taking limits and the BIM maturity level of PAs into account, this step-by-step adoption will help PAs to support BIM implementation and leverage their processes.},

   abstract = {As global agricultural production methods and supply chains have become more digitised, farmers around the world are adopting digital agricultural technologies (AgTech) such as drones, IoT, remote sensors, blockchain and satellite imagery to inform on-farm decision-making. Yet, on the backdrop of a persistent digital divide between rural and urban communities, many Australian farmers are not taking up digital AgTech. It has been argued that these farmers are being ‘left behind’ in an increasingly digital world, and this may impact their future success. Scholars of digital AgTech adoption typically take a siloed approach, positioning the individual or farm as the key unit of analysis, with fewer studies addressing structural conditions. This has provided a useful but incomplete understanding of the disparity between users and non-users. This paper builds upon emerging sociocultural approaches, which aim to address this gap, by using a novel ‘communitive ecology’ analytical approach to consider how adoption occurs through networks of actors. Based on an exploratory, qualitative study of a digital farming project on a cotton farm and its digital communicative ecology in South-East Queensland, Australia this study identifies technological, discursive, and social factors of digital AgTech adoption. Overall, an evolution from a digital divide to data divide, expressed in the interactions between farmers and stakeholders, and characterised by gaps between the generation and application of farm data, is observed.},

This technology, which underpins cryptocurrency, provides an immutable, decentralised, and transparent distributed database of digital assets for use by firms in supply chains.

Using Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC), this paper identifies the adoption barriers, examines the interrelationships between them to the adoption of blockchain technology, which has the potential to revolutionise supply chains. The TISM technique supports developing a contextual relationship-based structural model to identify the influential barriers. MICMAC classifies the barriers in blockchain adoption based on their strength and dependence. The results of this research indicate that the lack of business awareness and familiarity with blockchain technology on what it can deliver for future supply chains, are the most influential barriers that impede blockchain adoption. These barriers hinder and impact businesses decision to establish a blockchain-enabled supply chain and that other barriers act as secondary and linked variables in the adoption process.},

This rethinking relates especially to sales managers’ efforts to facilitate cognitive unlearning in B2B sales management during the ongoing digital transformation taking place in enterprises. Unlearning—the process of purposely reflecting on and discarding old ways of knowing and doing—is crucial to prevent outdated organizational knowledge and routines from becoming a barrier to change. Before adopting new sales practices, sales organizations must first discard old ways of knowing and doing. Drawing insights from unlearning and B2B sales management literature and conducting empirical qualitative research on 31 executives and senior managers operating in various industries, the study outlines a four-phase process for unlearning as well as several key themes within each phase. The findings emphasize how top management facilitates cognitive unlearning regarding digital business transformation in the B2B sales context. The study contributes to sales management literature by introducing cognitive unlearning as a new theoretical angle on the issue of digital transformation.

   abstract = {New technologies are playing a fundamental role in the postmodern era of globalization where interpersonal interactions at the international level and the exchange of goods, services, information and capital are the basis of all activities. The agriculture sector is constantly facing numerous challenges including the steady growth of the population, climate change, the increasing number of catastrophes, the loss of biodiversity and the spread of parasites. This paper analyzes the impacts of Blockchain applications in agriculture and the food supply chain, through a survey literature review, providing the various players in the agriculture value chain with new tools and key technologies to improve production and distribution processes. To demonstrate the importance of applying the Blockchain in the agriculture sector, especially for emerging countries, the case of South Africa is examined. This focus is one of the unique aspects of this paper, which is the first to deal with this kind of solution applied to the South African context. Our findings indicate that Blockchain, in the e-agricultural context, has the potential for reshaping the entire sector, contributing also to the resolution of the food crisis. This paper discusses the overall implications, limits, challenges and potentials of these applications, from a critical point of view.},

This study examines how the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) practises digital diplomacy, and specifically ‘social media diplomacy’. It analyses the MFA’s posts on Twitter and Facebook in terms of content, in addition to a network analysis of connections. The study aimed to determine the government’s tactics and strategies, and to consider its challenges. Findings indicate that the number of social media connections have not changed significantly relative to the pre-COVID-19 period, suggesting that while the MFA is equipped to deploy social media diplomacy to conduct public diplomacy, its tactics and strategies are not optimal. This article proposes alternative tactics and strategies, such as networking and coalition-building with other actors, to achieve the country’s overall foreign policy objectives.},

For the purposes of this research ‘doing’ DT is defined as leveraging digital technologies to significantly alter an organisational design in order to enhance customer engagement. To fulfil this objective, we select 16 key informants (digital transformation leaders) based on their organisational perspective (Business or IT) and role (Strategic or Operational), which facilitates hearing 4 types of practitioner voices. Following an inductive open coding approach, 348 excerpts were coded, leading to the emergence of 95 concepts, which were further grouped into 14 categories. In this paper, we focus our write-up on the six most frequently occurring categories that are shaped by all four key informant groups (practitioner voices). This paper is unique in providing a holistic categorisation of the defining characteristics of ‘doing’ DT, while also providing 24 ‘Practitioner Priorities’. These ‘Practitioner Priorities’ sharpens the focus of academia and practice, highlighting the ‘role of people’, ‘role of data’ and ‘role of technology’ when ‘doing’ DT.},

This study takes a holistic view of consumers’ energy-related behaviour by identifying the factors driving the adoption of rooftop solar photovoltaic and by distinguishing the electricity conservation practices of solar and non-solar households. We reveal a nuanced understanding of the rebound effect from a behavioural perspective, which may help solar energy policy formulation and efficient decarbonization pathways in Australia and elsewhere. A face-to-face survey of 325 households in a regional city, principal component analysis and binary probit analysis were used to investigate the intention to install rooftop solar photovoltaic panels. The results show that home ownership, unwillingness to sacrifice personal comforts to save electricity, being pro-energy efficiency, and income are positively related to rooftop solar installation. In addition, different segments, such as the ‘energy-efficiency advocate’, the ‘digital tool lovers’ and the ‘behaviour change advocates’ were identified. Finally, recommendations for policy and practice are made to promote rooftop solar and more careful use of electricity in the residential sector.},

Supply chain efficiency and sustainability are among the key issues that logistics systems have increasingly considered in recent years. In this context, this paper proposes a cloud-fog architecture to meet the new requirements of logistic networks based on the Physical Internet (PI) model. This study uses a simulation approach to evaluate supply chain performance in terms of time and cost-effectiveness by comparing two scenario models: the ‘cloud-only’ model and the ‘cloud-fog’ model. The strategy adopted is based on both the A-star (A*) pathfinding algorithm and the real-time processing capabilities enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and fog computing. The proposed solution allows for optimal physical routing at a competitive cost and within a reasonable time frame. Furthermore, increased visibility and traceability are achieved throughout the supply chain.},

Drawing on historical analysis of the Indian film and television industries, we argue that just as the informal means of finance, social relations, illegal cable and satellite distribution had a formative influence on how these industries formalized, the Indian online audio-visual sector is driven by distinctive formalization processes, led by creators who are engaging with both local and global UGC-led platforms as well as PGC-led portals. Using a critical media industries framework, with data gathered from semi-structured interviews with ‘above-the-line’ Indian online media practitioners together with trade press literature, we propose an analytical framework that incorporates both platforms and portals as industrial objects for mapping digital production cultures that originate as inherently informal.},

The study reports results from a nationwide study conducted in Greece, during a three-year period, which sampled responses from 604 physicians and nurses working in 14 Greek hospitals. Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling analysis is used in order to confirm the structure of the Technology Readiness Index. The results confirm the five groups of the TR taxonomy. Statistical differences were found between classes in information and communication technology (ICT) knowledge, ICT feature demands, hours of use per week as well as ICT use performance, but not in the general use of ICT. The results facilitate comprehension of the factors, which influence the use of ICT by medical staff and, in addition, they convey important policy and managerial implications. In conclusion, medical staff should be treated according to its TR taxonomy classes in order to expedite the acceptance and use of an ICT system.},

   abstract = {The paper breaks through the existing research on digital economy and value chain, puts forward to digital economy value chain (DEVC) for the first time, discusses the connotation, value activity composition, and value chain characteristics of the digital economy value chain. Digital Economy Value Chain is the innovation of the value chain driven by digital elements (data, digital technology, digital mode, etc.) and the integration of the digital economy and value chain. Its foothold in the digital elements and its essence is the chain organization of value creation activities of the digital economy. Every value-added link of the digital economy value chain can realize value creations. The flow direction of the value chain is the process of value creation and value transfer. At the same time, this study attempts to analyse the operation mechanism of the digital economy value chain. This paper analyzes the formation mechanism, transmission mechanism, and the working mechanism of the digital economy value chain, reveals the operation mechanism of the digital economy value chain, and constructs a complete theoretical framework of the digital economic value chain.},

DeLone and McLean‘s information system success model, one of the most widespread ones, does not specifically encompass concepts that recently gained much attention: user experience (UX) and co-creation. The goal of the study was to develop and validate a broader model fit for measuring the success of digital services in higher education. Based on the feedback from over 550 end-users, the analysis confirms the importance of UX and co-creation as success factors of digital services in higher education. In that, higher-order construct analysis provided a means to examine the digital service quality construct comprehensively and bring forth the much-needed multi-dimensional perspective on the topic. More specifically, the influence of co-creation on the higher level of perceived benefits of digital services adds to the body of knowledge that promotes the evolution of service-dominant logic.},

In this study we identify patterns of change in the population’s adoption of and receptiveness to digitalization. The focus is on registering the expansion of digital routines influenced by the coronavirus depending on the place of residence, infrastructure and demographics. The results of a population survey held in August 2020 across all municipalities of the Kaliningrad region of Russia suggest that the magnitude of the pandemic’s effect in accelerating digitalization is different for various population types. Most receptive to digital innovations are residents of economically developed municipalities aged 26–40 with higher education having a stable Internet connection at a fair price. The article presents a typology of municipalities on the adoption of and receptiveness to innovation. It is shown that without the established infrastructure, technological, economic, cultural and behavioural basis, the acceleration of digitalization does not occur.},

Tax policy proposals are suggested for delineated groups of African states based on the idea of narrowly targeted digitally related policy for the leaders and broad cooperation between all the African states. Such an approach can ensure the economic potential of multilateral cooperation among developing countries and defend their economic and fiscal interests at the global tax governance level.},

This article argues that although Asia/ASEAN-led PTAs such as RCEP and ASEAN E-Commerce Agreement appear less ambitious at first sight, when compared to digital trade chapters in PTAs led by western states such as the CPTPP, they are both relevant and appropriately suited to foster digital trade integration in the region. Viewed from the perspective of New Asian Regionalism, these agreements contribute substantially to the global economic order by leveraging the collective power of the Asia-Pacific through a pragmatic, incremental approach. By combining soft law mechanisms with specific legal obligations, these PTAs have better-addressed variations in digital development levels and policy preferences across countries, eventually leading to meaningful consensus-building and long-term engagement in complex areas of digital regulation.},

Individual predispositions such as resistance to change, AI anxiety, and attitudes towards robots were used as the independent variables. This paper presents the research conducted on 220 museum employees. The results suggest that museum staff react to the decision on the adoption of social robots cognitively, emotionally, and behaviourally. Negative cognitive reactions are elicited by earlier negative attitudes towards interactions with robots. Negative emotional reactions are associated with earlier negative attitudes towards interactions with robots and the fear of being replaced. Ultimately, behavioural reactions are elicited by all of the above along with the anxiety of learning new technological skills.},

To deliver high-quality IT services, plan-driven IT Service Management (ITSM) frameworks and standards have been used in business organizations in the last two decades. Nowadays, new and claimed agile ITSM frameworks and standards have emerged but there is a scarcity of studies on their extent of agility coverage. This research addresses this knowledge gap. First, we elaborated a plausible Integrative Agile ITSM Framework of Tenets and Practices from a selective review of the main related SwE and ITSM literature. Second, we populated the integrative framework with all available evidence about the agile tenets and practices reported in the official publications of the new five ITSM frameworks and standards. Third, we explored its utilization with a Panel of ITSM Experts for ranking how much the new five ITSM frameworks and standards fit the integrative framework. Exploratory results revealed high concordance among experts to qualify ITIL v4 and VeriSM as agile, and FitSM, and the two ISO/IEC standards as lightweight but not agile. This research contributes to the ITSM literature with an Integrative Agile ITSM Framework of Tenets and Practices, and the ITSM practice with an exploratory evaluation from ITSM experts on the adherence to it from the new five ITSM frameworks and standards. Given the critical dependence of any business activity on IT services, further theoretical and empirical research is worthy to be pursued.},

While extant research identifies the diffusion of digital innovations in firms as a non-linear process influenced by embedded contextual elements stemming from several complex social systems, it does not address the relationship between these social systems. A longitudinal embedded case of the process followed by one incumbent firm as it adopts building information modelling (BIM) is presented. Data covers a 15-year period and charts the adoption process at multiple levels: user, firm and institution. The case supports existing research by showing that BIM adoption in the firm is successful through a combination of actions involving 1) investment and leadership support, 2) standards and policies and 3) training and skills development. Drawing on Gidden’s Structuration Theory, it contributes to this research by finding that the adoption of BIM is facilitated by a mutually constitutive relationship between user, firm and institution. Firms play a central role in enabling this relationship, by both attending to and enabling endogenous user-led change while seeking to influence exogenous institutional change.},

This paper uses an instrumental-use multiple case study approach to explore the design and implementation of place-based policies within the institutional arrangements of four regional innovation agencies (RIAs) established in three different regional contexts inside and outside the European Union: one in the Brainport region (the Netherlands), two in the Basque Country (Spain) and one in Medellín (Colombia). In analyzing the RIAs’ similarities and differences, this paper explores the complexity of designing and implementing place-based innovation policies in different regional innovation systems (RISs) while noting important policy implications for regional innovation governance and institutional arrangements to upgrade RIS in a more systematic manner.},

This study adopted a post-positivist paradigm, with a cross-sectional quantitative research design using a survey within the mining industry. The responses (n = 211) represented a response rate of 74.8%. The results show a composite score, (Formula presented.) = 17.80, with (Formula presented.) = 50.9%, indicating that the mines were in an initial or ad hoc activity stage but are migrating towards an established, focused process stage.  Confirmatory tetrad analysis indicates a reflective model, with an acceptable model fit, SRMR = 0.068. A one sample t-test confirmed that all dimensions of Quality 4.0 had statically significantly lower mean scores than the ideal profile of 5.0 with a large effect size. This study provides an effective approach for quality management practitioners, process owners, and management to effectively assess the progress of Quality 4.0 implementation and identify gaps for improved performance. Identified priority areas for improvement are management commitment to technology and innovation-driven operations, technology-driven employee involvement and empowerment, and process and systems integration. The study provides a comprehensive approach to conducting gap analysis and contributes to the growing body of knowledge on Quality 4.0.},

In this case, a study conducted at a vocational–a rural community college in South Africa–we explore the readiness of lecturers (N = 15) to use an institutionally-designed Learning Management System (henceforth referred to as MLMS) to engage their students in learning. The study revealed that the participants were largely unprepared to use the MLMS for teaching. This lack of readiness was influenced by the (poor) MLMS design, lack of user expertise, and inadequate technological resources for lecturers and learners. It emerged from the findings of this paper that the MLMS needs upgrading to improve its effectiveness for online and teaching purposes. The findings suggest that the college should seek the buy-in of lecturers by providing them with further training on the use of the MLMS.},

State aid is handed out by government agencies which believe that their support can help independent, professional journalism thrive in the digital, mobile, and platform-dominated future. Government support mainly comes as direct financial grants or indirect tax offsets. It aims at engendering economic opportunity and prosperity, while safeguarding journalistic independence and quality of output. Ideally, this shall foster the production, distribution and consumption of original and high-quality news in the public interest, which, in turn, shall keep people informed, facilitate public debate, and hold power to account. Still, this study finds arguments that government funding models for independent journalism in the public interest are limited by several critical challenges that endanger their principles, do not avert failure in the news media market and prevent effective policy governance. These deficits may even be exacerbated in the digital era.},

   abstract = {This article challenges existing approaches to local government within the discipline of public administration through a case study of off-campus student communities in post-apartheid South Africa. These communities have become contemporary political spaces through the daily activism of students who occupy urban space both as off-campus students and as ‘new’ members of the community with a politicised outlook on their daily lives. The heightened political consciousness that derives from a long history of South African student activism brings different kinds of community engagement for local government to contend with, which are not easily captured by the spatially bounded understanding of local government that is assumed both by the law and by existing theory. Although early literature on studentification emphasised the agency of residents resisting the disruptive impact of students on community life, I argue that the South African case requires a view of students as political agents who demand basic services and improved livelihoods in the city on their own behalf both as students and as city residents. This intersectional pattern of citizenship that students bring to the South African university city gives them a substantial foothold to influence productively and direct the governance patterns of both local government and higher education. The article calls for the beginning of critical local government studies in two ways: a centring of students’ political agency in the theorisation of studentification and a contextual positioning of studentification in the literature of local government studies. This, I argue, could generate transdisciplinary possibilities for the revitalisation of the public administration discipline.},

This study categorises four main findings. The first is that there are four PLE research themes: adoption; integration; model, architecture and framework; and recommenders. The PLE is suitable to support SRL because they share similar ideas regarding personalisation and ownership, the need to integrate formal and informal learning and the need for student-centred learning environments covering flexibility and features. Furthermore, the PLE acts as a tool and a recommender for students. The final finding is that the available PLE platforms have the following characteristics: they act as a personal assistant; they support students in planning, monitoring and evaluating the learning process; they promote collaboration between students; and they act as a widget-based application.

Widely cited data on adoption rates suggest that digital technologies are making their way into every facet of life in African societies — a broader change process cast in this paper as digital transformation seems to be underway. We look beyond adoption rates and examine actions that bring about favorable economic, organizational, political, social, and cultural environments which digital technologies depend on to realize their transformative potentiality. In our view, pure adoption does not indicate any broader change or transformation but rather indicates a potentiality for change — a latent power to catalyze broader societal change processes. In this paper, we develop a framework to make sense of Africa's emerging digital transformation. In so doing, we elaborate on the multiple environments that digital technologies are embedded in and, by extension, the multidimensional change processes they need to ignite. The goal is to provide a better understanding — and new avenues for research — why actions and changes in some environments tend to more readily embrace the new possibilities offered by digital technologies while others seem disconnected and are lagging behind.},

This article discusses the formation of journalism as an ism in the context of the industrialisation of the news media. It situates journalism as an ideology of expert observation within struggles over the power of news media in the first half of the twentieth century. Noting that the ability of journalism to discipline the news depended on bottlenecks in the media system, the article traces the crisis of hegemony that has accompanied the digital transformation of media infrastructure. It concludes by imagining a new hegemonic journalism.},

The methodology was a systematic review on soccer leadership, published between 1995 and 2020. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were used, resulting in a sample of 80 articles. Several indicators were analysed in order to identify the authors who have most studied this topic, the most cited articles, the journals where they were published, and the thematic clusters developed around the topic. Through a content analysis, four research clusters were distinguished: Behaviour, Performance, Style, and Formation. The clusters with the highest number of publications were Behaviour and Performance. The results suggest that the theme of leadership in soccer should be more developed in the Formation cluster, particularly among coaches. The study can be useful for all stakeholders involved in the context of soccer, when using leadership as a strategic tool to improve organizational performance.},

In this paper, we develop an analytical model to capture the digital transformation of knowledge order. Drawing on insights from social epistemology, sociology and history of knowledge, and media history, we identify epistemic practices as basic elements of knowledge order. We then analyze how epistemic practices are organized into an overarching structure of knowledge phases, contexts, roles, and hierarchies. Digital media tend to destabilize the traditional knowledge order. This destabilization is characterized by a more flexible order of phases, a dissolution of boundaries between contexts, an opening of professional roles to new actors, and a flattening of hierarchies.},

Results from a survey of 130 companies show that knowledge acquisition has a positive effect on innovation. In addition, this study showed that in terms of direct effects on innovation results, the personalization strategy has a more important role than the codification strategy. However, among the two knowledge management (KM) strategies, only the codification strategy moderated the knowledge acquisition–innovation relationship. The findings also suggested that in order to achieve a high level of innovation results, the firm should not be overly dependent on the implementation of the codification strategy without paying due attention to personalization strategy. Furthermore, for firms at the nascent stage of development or those in developing countries like Vietnam, knowledge acquisition and personalization strategy can lead to innovation results.},

In addition, our study also examines the organisational actors engaged in the application of DT initiatives through the social practice theoretical lens of Bourdieu, regarding habitus, capitals, and fields. The results reveal that although DAL-DT, in principle, provides effective strategic plans along with a cohesive corporate culture that supports the implementation of DT initiatives, there are some constraints to this innovative reform. For instance, the top management of commercial banks in developing nations seem to display a lack of willingness and misunderstanding of the concept of DT, add to that the lack of suitable resources coupled with over-expectations.},

In the third round, the study weighted the importance of each factor and indicator through an analysis of the AHP technique. The research suggested that social factors were more important than technical factors. Importantly, the findings indicated three key factors of the TQM 4.0 model, including top management, quality culture 4.0, and integrating sustainable development. Furthermore, the study revealed that top management commitment, quality-driven mindfulness, and employee empowerment were specified as the most critical indicators of the TQM 4.0 model.

Using qualitative and quantitative methodology, qualitative methods are used to make questionnaires, and quantitative methods are used to measure the scale and analyze the impact of each factor. The data used in the study was collected using a survey questionnaire from a sample of 395 managers (directors, deputy directors, chief accountants) and accounting staff with knowledge of management accounting/strategic management accounting in Vietnamese manufacturing enterprises. Based on the collected survey data, we performed a multivariable linear regression analysis with SPSS 20 to test the relationship between the contingency factors and the application of SMA. Regression analysis results show that contingencies such as organization size, competitive intensity, organizational structure (decentralized management), organization’s technology, business strategy, and perception of market instability positively influence the application of SMA in Vietnamese manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, the study provides insight that contributes to a better understanding of the impact of contingency factors on the application of SMA in the context of manufacturing enterprises in emerging economies like Vietnam. This finding is useful for policymakers and business managers in developing and promulgating mechanisms to influence these random variables to motivate enterprises to use more SMA techniques.},

In this work, we concurrently deploy the rigorous six-step SLR protocol together with co-citation analysis, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling-based fuzzy k-means clustering, and keyword extraction and co-occurrence analysis to ascertain and examine clusters of CLSCM application. The results show that there are six established research clusters in CLSCM, namely, logistics and SCM for prefabricated construction, construction procurement, construction supply chain integration, green construction SCM, reverse logistics in construction and onsite construction logistics. Amongst these clusters, construction supply chain integration plays the most integral role. Informed by this ascertained knowledge structure, we explore the research trends during the period reviewed, propose a conceptual framework for CLSCM and suggest research avenues.},

Our findings imply that the digital was most often used to enhance assessment design and to develop students’ digital skills. Other purposes for designing the digital into assessment were less present. Only eight studies situated the students within the wider context of digital societies, and none of the studies addressed students’ critical digital literacies. Thus, while there are pockets of good practice found within the literature, the vast majority of the studies employed the digital as an instrumental tool for garnering efficiencies.

   abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of alpha-increase neurofeedback training (Performance Enhancement Training) on blood pressure, stress reduction, attention, and observe changes in brainwave patterns. A forty-nine-year-old male college student diagnosed with essential hypertension controlled by medication had undergone twenty-six sessions of alpha-increase biofeed-back (8-13 Hz) at PZ electrode site for a period of 15 weeks. Method: Pre- and post-blood pressure measurements were taken for every session. At the beginning of week number eight, the participant discontinued his medication as advised by his physician. Pre- and post-visual TOVA CPT test was administered to assess the changes in accuracy, reaction time (RT), and RT variability. Osterkamp and Press Self-Assessment Stress Inventory was administered before and after training to assess the level of stress. QEEG evaluation was conducted prior, as well as upon completion of the study. Results: Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) yielded statistically significant results between pre- and post-sessions within participant blood pressure measurements. The participant's systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the first thirteen sessions were not significantly different from those of the last thirteen sessions when his medication was discontinued, suggesting his ability to control his blood pressure within normal limits without the use of medication. The results of the TOVA test clearly indicate an improvement in individuals' reaction time and the reaction time variability. The results of the Osterkamp and Press Self-Assessment Stress Inventory indicated an improvement in two of the scales: Work and Social Life. Statistical analysis showed that before and after QEEG evaluations were within normal limits. Discussion: The mechanism through which Performance Enhancement Training simultaneously affects blood pressure, reaction time (RT), and variability needs further investigation. However, the positive changes in the measured variables appear to be a function of enhanced self-awareness that leads to the improved self-regulation. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Lean principles are commonly applied to improve processes and create flawless material and information flows. However, integrating lean principles into Industry 4.0 has not been well elaborated in previous studies to address dynamic changes and complex material and information flow in processes. In this study, a comprehensive framework for integrating lean principles and industry 4.0 is proposed for addressing the issues mentioned above. A lean-based architecture is developed in an Industry 4.0 context to enhance connectivity between Industry 4.0 elements and enable better information exchange efficiency with improved decision-making accordingly. Besides, a smart value stream mapping VSM 4.0 is proposed to improve materials and information flow and allow real-time self-decision-making throughout production processes by utilizing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies. The suggested Lean-based Industry 4.0 Architecture integrated with VSM 4.0 allows better system efficiency and responsiveness, controllability, and robustness against random failures.},

This study explores the challenges of rapid digital transformation arising during the pandemic in the higher education context. This research used the Q-methodology to understand the nine challenges that higher education encountered, perceived differently as four main patterns: (1) Digital-nomad enterprise; (2) Corporate-collectivism; (3) Well-being-oriented; and (4) Pluralistic. This study broadens the current understanding of digital transformation, especially in higher education. The nine challenges and four patterns of transformation actors serve as a starting point for organisations in supporting technological choice and strategic interventions, based on individual, group, and organisational behavioural levels. Moreover, five propositions, based on the competing concerns of these challenges, establish a framework for comprehending the ecosystem that enables rapid digital transformation. Strategies, prerequisites, and key factors during the (digital) technology development process benefit the cyber-society ecosystem. As a practical contribution, Q-methodology was used to investigate perspectives on digitalisation challenges during the pandemic.},

Teacher educators (TEs) are now tasked with designing online modules, facilitating online learning, and providing direct instruction for students online. There is a dearth of literature which explores how TEs understand and enact pedagogies for the asynchronous learning environment (i.e. facilitate teaching presence). Also missing from the literature are specific features of professional development (PD) experiences which develop that essential knowledge base. This paper reports on a mixed methods study which explores how TEs are best supported to facilitate teaching presence in an asynchronous learning environment. 123 TEs from a range of disciplines across 15 TE institutions in Ireland, participated in the study. Data were collected from an extensive online questionnaire, individual semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. Significant challenges in relation to planning for the asynchronous learning environment, fostering students’ authentic engagement with module content and cultivating student interactivity were unearthed. Findings also outline critical characteristics of PD experiences which, from a TE-informed perspective, positively impact knowledge growth with particular reference to teaching presence in an asynchronous learning environment.},

While this may be good in the case of transactional interactions, for example the online submission of tax returns, it is less clear that interpersonal services, such as working closely with the long-term unemployed, are best delivered digitally. We consider the impact of social services digitisation on vulnerable communities drawing on an analysis of remote Aboriginal communities. Digital uptake affords great opportunities, but it also carries risks. Some communities have no digital infrastructure and in certain cases traditional face-to-face services have been curtailed, leaving those not online with reduced assistance. We find that concerns about the ‘digital divide’ are well founded. Problems generated by e-government flow across boundaries and appear left to the third sector to resolve with the state playing an even more diminished role in the lives of disadvantaged citizens.},

Despite high expectations, higher education teachers have been slow to implement active digital learning. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate physiotherapy teachers’ attitudes toward and experiences with digital education and what the teachers’ considered prerequisites to a digital transformation of teaching and learning in physiotherapy. Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 teachers in physiotherapy education. The interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings: The findings illuminate teachers’ attitudes toward and experiences with digital education and their views on prerequisites to a digital transformation of teaching and learning in physiotherapy education, presented as four themes: 1) skepticism toward digital education; 2) digital technology as a tool to support the established teaching practice; 3) longing for teacher collaboration; and 4) calling for time to plan and learn, and significant academic leadership. Conclusion: This study shows how physiotherapy teachers are skeptical about digital education, primarily viewing it as a threat to established teaching practices. Taken together, the findings demonstrate a potential for digital transformation in physiotherapy education, which can be released by informing the current teaching practices with evidence from research showing how use of digital technology can improve teaching and learning in physiotherapy education.},

While developed economies are making remarkable progress and contributing geometrically to the global value chain, African emerging economies have continued to grapple with multiple uncertainties regarding industry 4.0 implementation at all levels. The main objective of this study is to develop a macro-level framework for developing industry 4.0 initiatives in emerging economies of Africa. Using a systematic literature review protocol, industrial transformation initiatives from 22 of 25 leading economies were analyzed based on 12 thematic indicators. The result shows that industry 4.0 in leading economies is built on named strategic initiatives with clearly defined objectives, policy thrusts, funding models, and multi-stakeholder involvement and implementation plans. This implies that the industry 4.0 agenda in emerging economies requires bespoke industrial transformation initiatives driven by robust policy, industry, and research integration. This paper makes theoretical and practical contributions by putting forward a macro-level innovation adoption model–the ‘coopetitive triple helix model’ and a national framework for developing industrial transformation initiatives for African emerging economies, respectively.},

It also examines the moderating influence of income levels and digitalization on the underlying link between COVID-19 economic policy response and digitalization while controlling for the tourism sector. The results show that developing countries devoted fewer resources towards curbing the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak compared to developed countries. High-level of digital access in some developing countries, however, enabled them to introduce lower economic stimulus packages to lessen the impact of the outbreak on the tourism industry. The results also indicate that economies with a larger tourism sector accompanied by higher levels of digitalization devoted fewer public funds to COVID-19 economic stimulus packages. The influence of digitalization on the underlying link is, however, income level dependent. For example, developing economies that are more digitized, accompanied by having a larger tourism sector, allocated more public funds to economic stimulus packages relative to developed economies. This suggests that the pressure to introduce massive stimulus packages is lower when tourism providers are better prepared to use more digital tools during a pandemic, especially in developed economies.},

The study was therefore construed to explore the barriers affecting the adoption of DTs for construction sustainability in Nigeria. A scoping literature review was conducted through which 23 barriers to the adoption of DTs were identified, which helped in the formulation of a questionnaire survey. Data was obtained from construction professionals including architects, builders, engineers, and quantity surveyors. Retrieved data were analyzed using several statistical tools such as percentages, frequencies, mean item scores, and exploratory factor analyses. Factor analysis revealed five clusters that are categorized as organizational, management, technical, regulatory, and economic. This study has the potential to guide researchers and industry practitioners on the need to develop an awareness of the need for innovation to foster the efficiency and productivity of construction projects. The evaluation of the key barriers facing the adoption of DTs would be beneficial to construction organizations, professional bodies, and the government with the view of achieving digital transformation of the sector. A major contribution of this study to the body of knowledge is that it describes how developing economies such as Nigeria where the adoption of DTs is slow can mitigate the identified barriers to achieving digital transformation. Thus, the findings of this study can serve as a basis for construction organizations in Nigeria and similar countries seeking the digital transformation of their activities.},

To varying degrees, RE is susceptible to the global disruption engendered by COVID-19 pandemic, given its considerable impact and associated uncertainties related to economy and disruption of manufacturing processes. Therefore, there arises a need to highlight the possible impact of COVID-19 on the RE sector in Africa. Based on extensive desktop analysis and semi-structured interviews, this study discusses the socio-economic and policy impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on RE exploration. Most respondents suggested that their income level was largely unaffected, though the activities of 16% respondents in RE exploration decreased by more than 25%. Our study indicated that supply chain disruption, health and safety challenge, and financial risk, among other risks, were posed by COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the opinion of the respondents varied on the summative impact of COVID-19 on the RE exploration in Africa. 40% of the respondents expressed that the pandemic affected their organization negatively, while 32% were positive on how the pandemic affected their business activities and income. Finally, the study proposed key priorities and strategies, such as digital transformation, domestication, and indigenization of RE technologies that can be deployed to accelerate renewable energy growth in the post-COVID-19 global pandemic era. This study will provide appropriate guidance for governments and renewable energy industries toward an accelerated uptake of renewable energy in Africa.},

We propose a middle-range theory which highlights that DT of professional practices in healthcare follows a different path. To build this theory, we transpose the metaphor of a “fitness landscape” from evolutionary biology to a professional healthcare context to build an intermediate conceptualisation, which is then refined through an empirical study. Our theory highlights that external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, changing patient behaviours or the availability of new digital resources, transform the “value landscape” upon which healthcare professionals create and deliver healthcare services to patients. Empowered by their professional autonomy and driven by their service orientation, healthcare professionals search for new paths and peaks for value creation and delivery across a rugged landscape. As digital resources are leveraged, new value propositions in practice emerge, and professional healthcare practices are digitally transformed.},

In this paper, the most critical nine augmented reality software selection criteria are identified. To help organizations to apply such criteria and make a selection that is most suitable for the enterprise, a multi criteria decision-making approach is suggested. The suggested method is based on a fuzzy spherical number. The complex proportional assessment method is used to calculate the rankings. Therefore, the suggested method is called SF-COPRAS. Moreover, the detailed definition of augmented reality features and terminologies is explained. Several augmented reality use-case scenarios are discussed for manufacturing organizations on their Industry 4.0 initiatives. This paper aims to guide decision makers on their augmented reality software selection journey. The offered framework aims to save time for investigating augmented reality solution features systematically and objectively.},

   abstract = {Nowadays organizations are increasingly engaged in talent management, because it allows firms to grow rapidly by leveraging on human capital. Most antecedent studies focused on expectations and motivations of talents living in developed countries. Though, a little is known about career expectations of talents in emerging economies, and whether they diverge from those of developed countries or not. However, this information might be of use for several motives. First, emerging countries have a high growth rate. Second, these talents may be effectively harnessed from domestic and non-domestic firms, depending on whether their expectations are met or not. Consistently, this study aims at exploring the career expectations of individuals in emerging countries, by capturing the heterogeneity of expectations between emerging and developed countries due to cultural, politic, economic, and religious differences. As a matter of fact, emerging countries are frequently characterized by low levels of both income and employment, differently from many developed countries. For such motives and because of the absence of valid employment alternatives, talents might be more willing to engage in entrepreneurial initiatives rather than attempting to be employed in an organization. Thus, the primary intent of this explorative study is to understand what are the factors that affect career expectations of talents in emerging countries. Consistently, a cross-sectional principal component analysis (PCA) was used for hypotheses testing. The sample refers to a set of African countries, based on data availability for 2019. Data used for the analysis are drawn from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and they refer to individual entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes. Notably, findings show that career expectations of talents are driven by motivation and opportunity, especially in the male groups. However, the study also originally shows that the need for achievement and the willingness to stand out are the main drivers of talents’ expectations. In a nutshell, talents may prefer independence over the employment status. Implications of the findings, at a business level, suggest that companies in emerging markets should revisit their talent management strategy in order to avoid the loss of many talented employees. As instance, they should grant more independence, raise the income, and favour internal and female entrepreneurship. Thereby, the original findings of the study contribute both theoretically and practically to the research domain by specifying that career needs of talented people vary according to context and time.},

Building on the logic of resource-orchestration theory, this paper presents a systematic literature review covering 39 studies published between 1990 and 2020 that summarizes the current state and trends at the intersection of digitalization, the entrepreneurs’ critical literacies, and information-seeking behavior. The review results reveal three main streams of research including (i) digitalization and entrepreneurs’ ICT adoption, (ii) entrepreneurs and critical literacies, and (iii) entrepreneurs’ information-seeking behavior. Based on the review results that reflect a fragmented status quo of entrepreneurship research, we develop a holistic framework and outline future research directions for entrepreneurship. This research expands the traditional boundaries of entrepreneurship research by considering the implications of entrepreneurs’ critical literacies and their information behavior on resource orchestration process. The findings provide practical implications indicating the need to address the key challenges of entrepreneurs in a fast-changing and interconnected business environment.},

   abstract = {The article explores the problem of the discrepancies between the careers that the Russian education system currently prepares students for and the needs of the labor market. Employers on the labor market and educational institutions cannot function effectively without an established mechanism for social exchange. However, the reality of the current situation is such that the current educational services market exists almost entirely independently of the labor market. A document-based content analysis has allowed us to identify key problems for the Russian labor market. These include a shortage of certain specialists, which is particularly glaring in certain fields; a high level of youth unemployment; a lack of demand for certain highly trained specializations and thus the inability of the country to effectively compete on the international market; and Russia's lagging position in the technology field. The education system also faces a number of problems. Some of the most pronounced ones include the brain drain of qualified and talented workers abroad; the insufficient funding of the research community; the decline in the prestige and quality of education; and the development of shallow thought patterns among young people that have resulted from the problem of fragmented culture. All attempts by the state to ease this crisis situation have not moved past creative window dressing. They have avoided addressing the fundamental roots of the problem. Our analysis has revealed a basic discrepancy between the types of subjects that educational institutions currently teach students and the needs of the labor market. Educational institutions have proven themselves unable to flexibly respond to changes on the labor market, and they have ignored its demands. In fact, most Russian schools do not subscribe to a unified system to help children choose a future career path. Schools use a formal approach to providing vocational guidance for young people: At best, students take one-time tests and receive brochures from for-profit institutions of higher education. If a unified, systematic model for career counseling were developed based on a mutually beneficial cooperative relationship, we would be able to establish an effective mechanism for social exchange between educational institutions and the labor market.

Hence, the pandemic has prompted the European Union to implement a coordinated strategy, one that has created opportunities to support the R&I sector. The Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), developed by the Conte government and finalized by the Draghi government, represents a potential turning point in defining more suitable governance mechanisms for long-term R&I policies aimed at strengthening sustainability and resilience in Italy. Likewise, events surrounding the Plan were the formal reasons for the appointment of the Draghi government in the first place. By evaluating policy documents and by analysing the preliminary measures adopted, this article analyses the Italian case, which reveals a potential shift. Indeed, while in the pre-COVID period Italian governance was characterized by an approach focussed on the government ministries, reforms triggered by the NRRP have configured a potential multi-level governance approach to the Italian R&I framework. This study also highlights the opportunities and risks of this shift–opportunities and risks that are particularly related to the role of regions and non-state stakeholders in defining appropriate R&I policies.},

We refer to this as the IT silo problem, where multiple non-consolidated IT systems are implemented to support expert practices. In this paper, we analyze this challenge using a mirroring lens. Our research question is, how can we create efficient digital services, utilizing the existing legacy systems in healthcare IT architectures? Our empirical evidence comes from a Norwegian case and contributes to the literature on IT architecture within Healthcare. First, we demonstrate how strict mirroring leading to sub-optimization and silofication is a major cause for the presence of IT silos. Second, we describe a process towards adaptive mirroring, and the resulting adaptive mirroring architecture. Adaptive mirroring is an architectural combinatory device that facilitates the design and use of efficient services, while also improving the flexibility of IT architectures.},

This study aims to assess the decision level on adopting SBTs and identify the factors that influence pertinent decision-making in developing countries. A questionnaire survey was adopted to collect data from 227 respondents, including project managers and construction design teams. Descriptive analytical tools and a one sample t-test were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that the decision level to adopt SBTs is moderately high in the Ghanaian construction industry. The significant factors influencing the decision to adopt SBTs are “Instrumentation and Control”, “Connectivity”, “Interoperability”, “Data Management and Analytics”, “Privacy and Security”, “IT Professional Support”, “Top Management Support”, “Viable Funding Strategy”, “Stakeholders' Computer Self-Efficacy”, “Stakeholders' Engagement and Participation” and “Participation and Collaboration.” Practically, the result serves as a valuable reference for assisting policymakers and practitioners in the construction industry, especially project managers and construction design teams, towards decision-making on smart buildings.

Methods: The Turkish version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was administered to all staff members (340 people) of a private hospital in the less developed eastern region of Turkey. Data was analysed by independent samples t-test, ANOVA, Welch statistics and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: The response rate was 76%. Among six dimensions of the SAQ (teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction, stress recognition, perceptions of management, and working conditions), stress recognition was the dimension with the lowest average. According to multivariate analyses; being younger, having a position as a nurse or technician/technical staff, working day–night and having longer years in the current hospital have an effect on the staff's more negative safety culture perception (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study provides important information on patient safety attitudes of a private hospital staff in the least developed region of a country. Stress recognition and safety climate dimensions are the areas that primarily need improvement.},

Data were collected in the Internet environment from 740 women living in Turkey via surveys generated through Google Forms within the study. According to the correlation analysis results, positive and weak relations were found between cyberchondria levels and digital literacy. According to the regression model, the increase in the participants’ perceptions of digital literacy statistically increases their cyberchondria levels. It was also determined that women’s digital literacy scores show statistically significant differences according to age, marital status, educational level, place of residence, and internet usage. On the other hand, it has been determined that the cyberchondria levels of women show significant differences according to their education and income levels. Cyberchondriac behavior demonstrates that digital transformation in health can reveal its negative consequences. For this reason, it is very important to provide training to women on digital literacy and to raise awareness about what needs to be considered in terms of accessing health-related information in these trainings. In addition, it is considered vital to take measures to reduce the anxiety of those who show cyberchondria behavior and to raise awareness that this is a serious problem. Thus, possible mental health problems can be reduced by preventing cyberchondriac behaviors.},

Literature warned of digitalisation’s side effects on psycho-social hazards at work. However, empirical evidence is inconsistent, especially in service industries such as education and healthcare, that rely on face-to-face exchanges to achieve organisational excellence. The article attempts to fill this knowledge gap, investigating digitalisation’s implications on psycho-social hazards in education and healthcare. A probit regression model was designed to examine digitalisation’s effects on 5 types of psycho-social risks at work, namely time pressures, poor relationships with colleagues, job insecurity, interaction with users, and irregular working hours. Digitalisation triggers an intensification of work, increasing time pressures. Furthermore, it recontextualizes organisational dynamics in the cyber-physical domain, disrupting social exchanges at work. Digitalisation determines greater job uncertainty, which is detrimental to work satisfaction. In order to curb psycho-social risks at work, health promotion measures are required, aimed at addressing the negative implications of digitalisation by restoring a ‘human touch’ in managing human resources. Disregarding the negative impact of digitalisation on employees’ well-being at work may undermine organisational viability in the post-COVID-19 era.},

   abstract = {Digital transformation has become a primary strategic choice of enterprises in recent years. We use Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen as samples, use text analysis to describe the degree of enterprises’ digital transformation, and empirically test the impact of managers’ information technology (IT) experience on the enterprises’ digital transformation. The research results show that the managers’ IT experience can significantly promote the enterprises’ digital transformation and has strong robustness. Heterogeneity analysis shows that only when IT managers have information technology-related work experience, greater power, and stronger salary incentives can their information technology experience effectively promote enterprises’ digital transformation. Further research shows that the IT experience of directors, supervisors, and executives all contributes to the enterprises’ digital transformation. This study guides human resource management in enterprises’ digital transformation in developing countries. Enterprises should focus on diversifying senior management team backgrounds and strengthen the internal training and external introduction of IT management talents.},

   abstract = {Enterprise Information Systems (EISs) are a strategic management tool for delivering value to supply chain stakeholders by enabling end-to-end coordinated and sustainable operations. Nonetheless, fundamental challenges during the implementation process of such digital systems are the disintegration of EISs and the emergence of relevant Critical Failure Factors (CFFs). To this end, extant research overlooks the potential of the combined application of Operational Research (OR) and Viable System Model (VSM) as heterarchical tools to structure EIS project implementations for enabling effective information sharing and communication in supply networks. Therefore, the aim of this research is twofold: (i) to develop a critical taxonomy of CFFs that impact industrial EISs’ implementation via exploring and reviewing recent EIS-focused projects; and (ii) to explore the role of soft OR and VSM in avoiding disintegration of EISs during implementation. This research presents guidelines for the successful implementation of EISs, derived from empirical data in a manufacturing firm. The study results contribute to the OR and the VSM research domains by identifying a practical framework to shelf-manage the complex interactions that emerge during an EIS’s implementation process.},

In this paper we extend the notion of the working nomad to the learning, ‘Knowledge’ nomad. New technologies allow for academics and students to study either at a specific place, remotely (virtually), or in any blended combination; this lets the spot where learning occurs to shift around the globe. We introduce the notion of the ‘Nomadic’ University by studying the views, observations and attitudes of the participants of an Erasmus + programme spanning 17 countries and of an International Workshop, based on questionnaires and interviews. In both surveys, it is strongly reported that the dynamics between knowledge ‘Nomads’ and local participants within culture, politics and business support meaningful learning and openness to foreign cultures. There are additional benefits and implications for political democracy, tolerance for uncertainty, innovation and entrepreneurship, putting the Nomadic university at the centre of the transformation of society.},

Indeed, prior research suggests that humblebragging elicits negative responses and, hence, is less preferable than straightforward bragging. The present research seeks to examine the conditions under which humblebragging might be more effective by exploring the celebrity versus influencer in the context of social media brand endorsement. Three experimental studies show that a humblebragging (vs. bragging) endorsement increases positive brand attitude when performed by a celebrity, but decreases positive brand attitude when performed by an influencer. Building upon benign moral violation theory, this research shows that these effects are mediated by amusement and irritation. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

The most important part of this intelligent system is the installation of a machine tending system that involves interface programming between the CNC machine tools and the industrial robot. Despite this importance, however, the machine tending system has many setup problems. It must be reprogrammed for both controllers whenever a new CNC machine tool or robot is introduced. Owing to the complex structure of the machine tending system, external engineers are required even though trivial changes have been made. To solve and remove inconveniences, there is a need to introduce a standardized and integrated system of the interface between multi-vendor CNC machine tools and industrial robots. In addition, the digital twin implemented inside the machine tool controller enables external engineers to easily change robot programming. To implement this system, an integrated development environment for: an intelligent platform that provides ISO 21919 interfaces to multi-vendors CNC machine tools, a robot platform developing application software of various robots, has been established.},

Digital exclusion is often compounded by existing social disadvantage, and new systems run the risk of creating new barriers and harms. Adopting a case study approach, this paper examines the exclusionary practices embedded in the design and implementation of social welfare services in Australia. We examined Centrelink’s automated Online Compliance Intervention system (‘Robodebt’) and the National Disability Insurance Agency’s intelligent avatar interface ‘Nadia’. The two cases show how the introduction of automated systems can reinforce the punitive policies of an existing service regime at the design stage and how innovative AI systems that have the potential to enhance user participation and inclusion can be hindered at implementation so that digital benefits are left unrealised.},

It focuses on lessons learnt during the Covid-19 Emergency Remote Teaching in the context of preservice elementary generalist teachers and how the pandemic has accelerated the “digitalization” turn. It discusses opportunities for experiential, collaborative and active learning that are transformative enough to overturn stereotypes and promote perceptions of self-efficacy in art learning. Further, it affirms necessary aspects of presence in an online environment–social, cognitive and teacher presence–to achieve successful student outcomes for non-art specialists. Drawing from pedagogy, the implications of the study offer policy recommendations to Higher Educational Institutions on how to support both teacher educators and pre-service teachers in the context of art learning.},

However, in the view of sales uncertainty, ‘Internet+Sales’ will impact firms’ traditional sales activity and raise the difficulty for managers to estimate future earnings performance, which causes a decrease in the accuracy of forecasts. Moreover, we also find a decrease in customer concentration in these firms, and a better performance in forecast accuracy in the e-commerce platforms with less sales uncertainty policy, indicating that uncertainty can affect forecast accuracy.

However, public blockchains challenge traditional regulatory models that assume centralised, single points of control facilitated via established intermediaries. In such a context, the present paper analyses the potential liability attaching to blockchain participants and considers how privacy laws apply to blockchain transactions, given the immutable nature of blockchain records. The paper then recommends reforms to strengthen blockchain regulation, including statutory recognition of fiduciary obligations for elite developers with super-user access to allow recourse for loss resulting from hard forks. A ‘hard fork’ is a radical change to a network’s protocol that leads to formerly valid blocks and transactions becoming invalid or vice-versa. Finally, the paper considers changes to privacy laws to permit ongoing consent and cross-border disclosure of data to accommodate blockchain operations.},

   abstract = {The digital revolution and the consequences of COVID-19 have had a significant impact on higher education. The need to develop digital competences, especially among educators and within the entire university system, has become a priority. Furthermore, due to the change of habits required by technology, digitization has entailed a great effort by professors. Until March 2020, the development of digital competence had been increasing gradually. However, its evolution has experienced a qualitative leap due to the impact of the COVID crisis, which forced all education to be delivered initially online, and later in hybrid form. Several theoretical models have been used to determine the digital competence of professors and its impact on student learning. The European Framework for Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) model is applied in this research. It defines the digital competence of professors in six areas comprising 22 competences, all categorized under three main headings. A survey with 271 university professors has provided the quantitative data analysis for the findings. The results will help to analyze professors’ digital competence evolution showing that self-perception has improved by 51%, which is significant. Finally, some conclusions regarding training and investment in universities are considered from the study results.},

The original essays offer keen insight into how post-network television is being valued as a new site of independent production for women, and examine how the connotations of creative control that attend this orients perceptions of both female creators and their content as feminist. Together, they provide a compelling perspective on the feminist consequences of how independence and “indie” have intensified as cultural sensibilities that coincide and engage with the digital transformation of television over the past decade.},

It is no longer sufficient to provide students with disciplinary knowledge. Graduates are also expected to be adaptive, innovative and flexible. As these competencies are better developed in connection with practice, this implies modifications in the learning design. In this context, work-based learning (WBL) emerges as a relevant approach as it provides students learning experiences oriented for the appreciation of work and practical knowledge. However, several issues still restrain its expansion in the European Union (EU). There is (i) a great disparity in WBL implementation among EU countries which relates to educational cultures, (ii) a concentration in certain disciplinary areas such as business and engineering, and (iii) a lack of quality assurance. Drawing on reports and materials produced by the Erasmus+ project Integrating Entrepreneurship and Work Experience into Higher Education (WEXHE), this paper explores these issues by identifying differences in the level of implementation as well as design and delivery of WBL in seven EU countries across four disciplinary areas. It then brings forward success factors and drivers instrumental to the further development of better WBL.},

However, it has not yet been investigated empirically how this process of alignment can be realized. We conduct a multiple case study on the two leading platforms involved in the online dissemination of cultural heritage–Europeana and Google Arts & Culture. Our findings reveal that a platform overtakes a rival one when it turns on multiple drivers of value creation in such a way that the drivers contribute to realigning the interests expressed by the stakeholders whose strategic objectives and beliefs were formerly divergent–or simply unrelated–to each other. This capability of realigning different stakeholders’ interests is independent of the level of industry-specific knowledge that the platform orchestrator has. The dynamics we document imply that Google has assumed a system integration role in the cultural ecosystem. This generates new trade-offs for museums in the way they generate value for the tourism industry. The paper enriches our understanding of what strategies digital platforms adopt to create value in big data contexts and provides a base to continue the investigation on other ecosystems driven by big data.},

The study builds on the notion of absorptive capacity to frame the SC transformation brought by the assimilation of specific digital technologies (i.e. Internet of Things, Cloud-based platforms, Augmented and Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence). We analyze how SC actors combine these technologies to develop their SC processes and routines in terms of real-time data exchange and end-to-end visibility between globally distributed companies, devices, products, and people. Key theoretical implications rely on identifying interconnection levels across SC processes that allow incorporating technological knowledge at the SC level, building on trustful collaboration and secure and reliable communications beyond the boundaries of every single factory. Results also provide practitioners with a set of collaborative practices and related challenges to integrate digital technologies at different (and complementary) levels as guidelines for a transformation towards SC hyper-connectivity aimed at improving the overall SC performance.},

In such an environment, it is particularly difficult to generate successful and sustainable business models, which are necessary for the widespread provision of telemedicine services. Following a design research approach, we develop and evaluate the CompBizMod framework, a morphological box allowing for: (1) the analysis, description, and classification of telemedicine business models, (2) the identification of white spots for future business opportunities, (3) and the identification of patterns for successful business models. We contribute to the literature by presenting a specific business model framework and identifying three business model patterns in the telemedicine industry.

There should be an integration of leadership concepts into this topic considering that corporate leaders are heavily involved in creating a new vision and implementing plans for the transformation. Continued exploration of how companies approach digital transformation and scholarly applications of conventional organizational leadership theories will help reveal the importance of parameters outside the scope of technology and strategy that contribute to successful implementation of new digital technologies. This paper applies dimensions of transformational leader behaviors (TLB) to highlight the behavioral changes that pertain to digital transformation. Because external crises and events could lead a company to transform, either voluntarily or forcefully, this research proposes planned digital transformation and forced digital transformation as two classifications that organizational leaders must recognize and apply dimensions of TLB for successful transformations. There is opportunity to incorporate behavioral elements in this topic area and theoretical models and empirical studies that test the relationship between leader behaviors and follower attitudes during a digital transformation are needed. Furthermore, in the case of forced digital transformation, the current research proposes that these relationships are further nuanced by the moderating role of stereotypical gender norms.},

This agenda is called data-centric geotechnics and it contains three core elements: data centricity, fit for (and transform) practice, and geotechnical context. The future of machine learning in geotechnics should be envisioned with this “data first practice central” agenda in mind. Data-driven site characterization (DDSC) is an active research topic in this agenda because an understanding of the ground is crucial in all projects. Examples of DDSC challenges are ugly data and explainable site recognition. Additional challenges include making ML indispensable (ML supremacy), learning how to learn (meta-learning), and becoming smart (digital twin).},

It is an open question what data-driven site characterisation (DDSC) can achieve and how useful are the outcomes for practice, but this “value of data” question is of major interest given the rapid pace of digital transformation in many industries. The scientific aspects of this question are presented as three challenges in this paper: (1) ugly data, (2) site recognition, and (3) stratification. The practical aspect that cannot be ignored is how to scale any solution to a realistic 3D setting in terms of size and complexity at reasonable cost. No deployment in practice is possible otherwise. At this point, the practicing community at large has yet to be convinced what data, big or small, could do to transform current practice.

Then, 16 experts were consulted to determine the degree of direct influence between two factors in the scales of 0 and 4 through a pairwise comparison using purposive sampling. Assurance was identified as the most significant factor, which is also a significant causal factor, and flexibility as the least important one that influence cloud adoption in Thailand’s public sector. Moreover, the key criteria for each factor were identified, and the impact relation maps were obtained.

Nonetheless, earlier research has neglected the question of how companies approach competence combination for digital transformation. Therefore, we investigated the views of top managers from ten companies in the Finnish machinery and metal products industry for this purpose. Based on an inductive analysis, we identified triggers for digital transformation and developed a managerial framework as a response. We argue that companies can create new transformative competence combinations by engaging in three activities: developing new competencies, promoting competence combination, and enhancing transformational leadership.},

Despite the efforts of several researchers to present models and frameworks for empirical applications based on the Capability Approach (CA), we found a theoretical gap when searching for scientific work addressing the social aspects of ICT applications; more specifically, how to operationalize eParticipation for good governance through CA. Hence, aiming to investigate the potential of eParticipation initiatives to enlarge individual capabilities, we carried out an in-depth literature review. As a result, we propose a conceptual framework consisting of four propositions that can contribute toward how approach and discuss the role of eParticipation to create new synergies between technology and development, addressing the demands of people, promoting participatory governance, and fostering human development.},

   abstract = {Background: Micro-credentials are increasingly considered a key mechanism through which to empower learners by enabling flexible upskilling and reskilling. Despite their apparent importance for higher education institutions (HEIs) and learners, empirical research is limited. More needs to be understood, particularly about the ways in which micro-credentials can shape institutional practice and provide benefits to learners. Purpose: Using a foresight approach, this study sets out to explore the potential for micro-credential adoption in relation to national and international policy initiatives and rapidly developing technologies. Its intention is to offer findings of interest internationally, particularly to those involved in strategic activities around micro-credentials. Methods: A four-step Delphi study approach was used to explore how micro-credentials may shape higher education (HE) in the next 5–10 years. Educational experts undertook a consensus-building activity utilising workshops and surveys: (1) initial identification of enabling factors (i.e. drivers) and beneficial outcomes (i.e. impacts) of micro-credentials; (2) prioritisation based on importance; (3) identification of enabling factors considered essential for each beneficial outcome and (4) analysis of the extent to which micro-credentials might be accepted in HE, with participants reflecting on the importance of the previously identified enablers and outcomes for alternative scenarios. Findings: The analysis sheds light on three alternative possible futures for micro-credentials. Expert consensus indicated that the potential of micro-credentials lies especially among educational institutions and the networks of institutions innovating beyond, and within, traditional study offerings and programmes. Future wide-scale adoption of micro-credentials was considered unpredictable, due to external factors at the ecosystem level, and beyond institutions’ own strategies and control. Conclusion: The findings suggest that, for the successful uptake of micro-credentials, the same benefits do not need to accrue for institutions and learners: a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach is not necessary or optimal. In order for the wider-scale influence of micro-credentials to be felt, there is a need for considerable international and national strategy development and implementation to overcome a variety of policy- and technology-related barriers that HEIs cannot influence or tackle on their own.},

This article aims to investigate these processes from a different perspective and vantage point. In particular, the translation of (trans)national instances into local micro-policy and practice is examined by historicising the social construction of digitalisation as a policy field in an Italian university over three decades (1988–2021). The emergence of knowledge and power arrangements across the complex entanglement of broader cultural history and local microhistory is thus examined. A hybrid configuration emerges in the observed university that features aspects from both its legacy bureaucratic mode of governance and the entrepreneurial paradigm. These institutional dynamics are consistent with wider systemic patterns in Italian higher education. The divergence between planned policy change and experienced realities is thus confirmed.},

In fact, the crisis may represent an incentive for change. One of the crucial issues in this crisis is the matter of copyright management in museum collections. Copyright is a valuable asset for organisations, on which the possibility of using artworks depends: without the regulated legal status of the work’s authorship, it is not possible to use the work’s copy and share it via electronic media, for example. Today’s crisis is an opportunity to shift perspectives and propose or even enforce new, more strategic solutions instead of mere short-term stopgaps. The aim of this paper is to answer the following questions: Is implementing copyright-management strategies a temporary need or a necessity? I do not wish to advocate for copyright reform but instead to examine what actions we need to take to formulate and implement copyright-management strategies. This topic will be discussed by drawing on the case study of the Polish History Museum to better explain the phenomenon in question (Stake 1995). The Polish History Museum is creating its first permanent exhibition, and it is the first institution in Poland to develop a copyright-management strategy for its collections. Having analysed interviews as well as secondary sources, I will answer additional questions. What were the stages in the open-policy formulation process? What procedures and organisational changes have been introduced in the museum? What are the current benefits and dangers of implementing copyright-management strategies? I will also discuss legal issues to provide a better understanding of copyright’s potential as a valuable and immaterial resource of museums. Although the analysed case is Polish, it presents examples of implementing copyright-management strategies that may inspire other museums, including those based abroad.},

The production of expertise is often highly specialised and domain specific, however this study observes a learning situation that places emphasis on collaborative interaction and group dynamics nested within dense creative networks. Design learning demands complex problem solving and decision making in response to contingent situations. These environments defy brevity of explanation, yet are microcosms of radical transformations in the digital economy. The reciprocal relationship between learning environments and industry are explored. Embedding in a network of learners and experts, using ethnographic methods blend situated insight with theoretical oversight. An ethnographic investigation of a learning organisation is applied to generate insight that reveals a dense network of collaborative practices, the production of experts and complex reciprocal relationships between learning and professional practice. Intense and inevitably participatory ethnographic engagements are indicative the processes of transformative change and challenge our understanding of the nature of learning. The role of innovation and flux in societal structures is reflected in these radically different approaches to learning. The image that appears is highly counterintuitive but prescient, providing foundations of new approaches to design education at the boundary.

Yet companies continue to base their selling strategies, spending billions of dollars, on a model of the customer decision process that is predicated on low preference certainty. Therefore, understanding the impact of customer preference certainty on the efficacy of the traditional selling paradigm is crucial. Through an extensive field study spanning four months across 15 different stores of a durable goods retailer and two experiments, the authors examine the consequences of this shift toward higher preference certainty for the practice of selling. Drawing on the theory of cognitive dissonance and adaptive selling, they find that a lack of consideration of the shift in customer decision making can hurt both salespeople and customers. Specifically, they find that ignoring customer preference certainty and unconditionally employing tactics that involve educating and challenging customers can have negative repercussions on purchase probability and sales revenue.},

Current burdens are the missing willingness to exchange far-reaching information even with long-term partners and the missing technological interface standards in order to enable a trouble-free communication alongside the SC. Second, the impact of Industry 4.0 and the Digital Transformation on decision making is greatly connected to information sharing. An increasing amount of decisions is prepared, recommended or even fully automated by information systems. However, usually, the human being still has the last word.

The conventional practice is to establish registration records for the basic information and cultural heritage of traditional villages combined with collecting historical records. This research develops a digital archival model to strengthen traditional village conservation. The theoretical framework of this model arises from a case study of Gaoqian, a typical traditional Chinese village with 1000 years of history. Through field investigation and document analysis, Gaoqian’s experience is summarized into a paradigm of traditional village digital archival conservation. There are three modules in this paradigm: a digital archival resource system, a digital archival management system, and a digital archival service system adhering to the culture-centred principle. This model transforms the initial cultural resources to digital archival resources and then to digital cultural products through strict life-cycle management. The whole working process needs the cooperation and participation of multiple subjects. The case of Gaoqian demonstrates that traditional village digital archival conservation is simultaneously universal and scene-oriented, which can provide replicable solutions for traditional villages or rural landscape conservation in other regions during ongoing world urbanization, with the appropriate archival perspective and methods.},

Through empirical analysis of data gathered from A-share heavy polluters from 2011 to 2020, our findings show that digital finance effectively improves the environmental performance of heavy polluters. The conclusions remain robust after controlling for endogeneity issues and running a series of robustness tests. The mechanism test reveals that the effects of financing and innovation are important channels through which digital finance influences industrial environmental performance. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis shows that the beneficial influence of digital finance on the environmental performance of firms is enhanced when firms are smaller, have non-state ownership, are located in East China, and have a lower level of financial development. These findings expand upon the factors that influence corporate environmental performance and provide empirical evidence that heavy-polluting companies should fully grasp the opportunities of digital finance development and improve their environmental performance in order to achieve higher-quality development.},

   abstract = {Innovation is fuel for the sustainability and competitive advantage of an organization. Practitioners have proposed several tools to promote innovation in an organization. The design thinking framework is one approach for problem-solving that can lead to innovations. Some industries have already matured in practicing the design thinking approach, while others are in the nascent stage and still exploring the benefits of creating more innovations. This article puts forwards a systematic literature review followed by a bibliometric analysis on adoption of a design thinking approach for fueling innovation and solving complex problems in different domains. The present study also gives an overview of the penetration of the design thinking approach in various industries and domains. The literature review reveals that design thinking is practiced in almost all industry segments, with more evidence in education and healthcare and an upward trend in user-centered design and complex problem-solving.},

   abstract = {Agility has long been recognised as a key determinant of organisational performance. The pursuit of agility within business units (BUs) is challenging as IT executives in multi-business organisations (MBOs) are tasked with balancing a need for organisation-wide IT synergies against a desire among BUs for local IT solutions that enable agility in their end markets. MBOs are increasingly turning to corporate IT platforms to respond to their BUs’ IT needs but doing so presents a challenge to BU IT autonomy and, in turn, to BU agility. In this paper, we posit that BU agility is determined by resource synergies based on the interplay between corporate IT platforms and local, BU-controlled, IT applications. These applications lead to greater BU process digitisation and, in turn, to expanded BU agility. We evaluate our model using data from an international survey of IT executives in MBOs. Our findings provide support for our model and, in so doing, identify different paths that MBOs can take to enhance BU agility. Our contribution affirms the value of corporate IT platforms for BU agility but suggests that MBOs should tread carefully when developing corporate IT platforms that coincide with mandatory use of shared IT applications.},

SMEs in Morocco are facing many barriers such as poor financial management, significant lack of managerial and professional skills and lack of financial resources. These obstacles have direct consequences on SMEs’ performance, their growth and indirectly have many socio-economic consequences on the labour market and country’s economy. This paper shares the process followed to design an adapted solution to transform SMEs’ current situation considering the specificities of their context. The solution proposed through this work, KFMS, has considered SMEs’ real problems and their life cycle phases’ priorities. The KFMS’ architecture integrates ontologies, statistical models and a sharing strategy component to allow managers to handle the financial domain, interpret financial indicators correctly, and build strategic future orientations.},

   abstract = {Firms’ competencies and competitive advantages erode and are required to continually update and change through learning. Organisational learning is a prerequisite for the creation and acquisition of knowledge, both catalysts for innovation. There are two processes of learning, exploitation (incremental) and exploration (discontinuous). Organisational excellence can in part be achieved by ambidexterity, that is, by the balanced pursuit of both incremental and discontinuous change by organisations. An ambidextrous organisational culture can be an important factor for a firm’s innovation capability. Thus, factors affecting organisational culture towards learning may advance innovative capability. Quality also plays an important role to knowledge creation and innovation behaviour. Indeed, knowledge management can improve innovation performance via total quality management practices. Quality, then, may serve as a mediator between organisational learning culture and innovation outcomes. Using the Organization's for Economic Cooperation and Development and European Union established criteria for technological intensity, as well as knowledge–intensity criteria, 480 Greek mid-to-high technology and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were contacted with 54 eventually participating. Statistical analysis (partial least squares-structural equation modeling) confirms the mediating role of the quality competitive capability on the association between exploitation and exploration-oriented organisational cultures and innovation performance. The study is cross-sectional, thus causality of the relationships under investigation cannot be justified. The cultural context should also be considered, since field research was conducted in Greece suffering from deep financial recession. The importance of quality competitive capability, in order to interpret organisational ambidexterity into innovative action in mid-to-high technology Greek SMEs during the financial crisis, guides managerial implications.},

We argue that beyond their own individual inadequacies, both approaches have common failings. We conceptualise the role of i4.0 in shaping the FoW in terms of the development of global value chains and i4.0’s implications for their digitalisation, where there is an underdeveloped analysis of change. We argue that the clearest expression of i4.0 is in the impact of ‘platform capitalism’, which already has implications for workers in the Global South and which, via i4.0’s digital integration with production, will potentially have significant implications for the quality of work in the Global North.},

A web-based survey was carried out in the Philippines, and a total of 365 valid responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results show that attitude and perceived behavioral control strongly drive the consumers’ intention to share resources in the sharing economy. Attitude is markedly preceded by altruistic and social tenets traditionally attached to sharing practices, while perceived behavioral control is endorsed by perceived trust and ease of use. Also, this work recognizes the attributions of culture to behavior as evidenced by the significant positive effect of collectivism towards the subjective norm. However, the potency of subjective norms on behavioral intention is argued.

Results showed that, although they rarely used it, participants positively evaluated the presence of an interactive feature in a digital magazine ad. Furthermore, parallel-mediation analyses revealed that the interactive magazine ad was perceived as more interactive and more surprising than the non-interactive ad, which ultimately positively impacted consumers’ attitudes towards the magazine. A second real-life setting experiment (N = 121) confirmed and extended these findings by revealing that the mediation effects were even stronger when consumers had used the interactive feature (vs. only seen). In addition, the relationship between interactive magazine ads and consumers’ attitudinal responses was explained slightly better by ‘perceived surprise’ than by ‘perceived interactivity.’.},

   abstract = {Agricultural and food system transformation helps increase farm productivity and encourages farmers to participate in updated value chains, adopt newer technologies, thereby helping farmers transform their livelihoods in a sustainable manner. Relatedly, value chain innovations depend on multiple decisions farmers make at various stages of the value chain, adequate participation being a primary factor. In this paper, we integrate farmers’ adoption decision of a new variety of chilli crop (“Teja”) along with their electronic market participation decision and e-market participation intensity, based on data from the chilli farming sector in India, where agricultural markets have been modernized through digitization (Kalgudi e-Market). Thus, the employed Triple-Hurdle Model (THM) integrates adoption decision of “Teja” variety of chilli, e-Market Participation Decision and e-market participation intensity thereby, allowing us to make inferences relating to chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh, India. Our results, showed that the drivers of “Teja” variety adoption, e-market participation, and e-participation intensity include education, reliable extension services, access to seeds of high yielding varieties, market information, and membership in farmer-producer organizations. Added to these, personnel training visits, prompt deliveries of inputs, and prompt payment of sales proceeds are also important in influencing participation and intensities. Results show that the three stochastic decisions of THM are strongly correlated implying that the adoption decision of “Teja” variety of chilli by the farmers influences the e-market participation decision and consequently, e-market participation intensity and these three decisions are sequential. On the contrary, the decisions viz., e-market participation decision and e-market participation intensity as input buyers and consequent adoption of “Teja” variety of chilli are simultaneous. So, the policy measures that promote production technology interventions (say, “Teja” variety of chilli) will definitely enhance better e-market access of chilli farmers. Accordingly, the breeding programs of the agricultural research stations should enhance the uptake of improved varieties in tune with modern marketing (e-market) technologies. Future farm policy and agricultural-research and innovations must recognize the potential that the digital marketing systems have to offer. Such considerations coupled with the provision of market infrastructure including assaying, grading, storage, and market information will promote digital transformation in agricultural value chains in developing countries like India.},

In this article, we propose a novel model named PersonalisedComfort to predict the thermal sensation votes of individuals living in a building. We use publicly available standard dataset ASHRAE RP-884 for experimentation and analysis. We apply conventional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms to predict the thermal sensation vote. PersonalisedComfort achieves an accuracy of 85% to predict thermal sensation votes which 8% higher than state-of-the-art studies.},

   abstract = {Digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today and are expected to revolutionize future value creation. Digital platforms require collaboration, but this is challenging especially in the manufacturing industry where sensitive data need shared and high investments are required. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of how to successfully collaborate on digital platforms in the manufacturing industry by developing a contingency framework. The study is an explorative single case study of a digital platform. More specifically, the study examined the development process of a digital twin platform created by a large high-technological company and its collaborative actors. The results are based on 21 semi-structured interviews and reveals that actors on digital platforms can face five types of challenges that hinder a successful collaboration: disadvantages of dependency, uncertainty regarding data management, varying customer needs, insufficient work methods, and unsuitable payment models. The analysis also reveals four strategies that can be used to address the challenges: transparency strategy, incentive model strategy, servitization strategy, and control strategy. Moreover, these findings are summarized in a contingency framework that explains which types of challenges that can be addressed with which strategies based on the specific prerequisites of each collaboration.},

   abstract = {This study investigates older persons engagement with digital interfaces as one important way to social inclusion. Digital exclusion and social exclusion are intrinsically intertwined, which put older persons at risk for exclusion. To construct meaningful educational practices for inclusion, more insight is needed to understand consequences of low digital competence. Eighteen men and women (retired) have been interviewed about their everyday encounters with digital interfaces. Results show how older persons ‘borrow’ knowledge from social networks or from contacts at previous workplace, to access technology and digital practices. Data also show a common acceptance of exclusion and changes in lifestyle. These fragile chains, put together to access digital practices jeopardise social inclusion understood as autonomy and participation in society. Informants did not mention community arrangements as resources for access and knowledge, which indicate that hard work is required to promote inclusion of this group. A possible way could be using the power of informally framed learning scenarios. Society cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that groups of citizens are hindered from developing capabilities to maintain a social life, to access the health sector, to enjoy integrity and independence and cultural recreation–to live a capable life.},

   abstract = {Technological development has experienced exponential growth in recent years, giving rise to important digital transformation processes at the company level. In order to ensure that these digital transformation processes achieve the desired results, it is essential to draw a strategic roadmap of the processes from vision to implementation. This implies combining design and management activities with thought and action abilities. Digital transformation, always complex, becomes less certain and more interesting when considering results related to environmental issues. This study aims to analyze how the combined effect of five variables (digital vision, digital orientation, digital strategy, transformation management intensity, digital management and departmental agility)–related to digital transformation and categorized as design, management, thought and action–lead to environmental performance. The study uses a sample of agro-industrial cooperatives and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The results of the necessity and sufficiency analysis indicate that some of the design variables (especially digital vision and digital strategy) need to be present to lead to environmental performance. Likewise, the absence of the two management variables (especially digital management transformation) leads to the absence of environmental performance. The paper demonstrates the need to combine design and management activities and thought and action abilities to lead to the presence of environmental performance.},

As highly innovative small- and medium-sized market leaders, HCs are challenged to maintain their niche dominance but are endowed with significant resources. However, firms in rural areas face resource constraints related to digitalization and innovation. Based on qualitative interviews with 28 companies, we develop a typology of HCs with four firm types differing in their handling of digitalization: Digital HCs, HCs of Digitalization, Traditional HCs, and Digitalization-Skeptical HCs. Their digitalization-related potential and risk assessment, resource availability, strategy, and innovation types are portrayed. We provide evidence that innovative market leaders in rural areas are not necessarily also digitalization front-runners. We contribute to a deeper understanding of the nexus of digitalization, SMEs, and rural areas. Our findings have managerial and policy implications. Less innovative SME can emulate HCs’ handling of digitalization. Regional policymakers should expand firm type-specific digitalization policy formulation.},

Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), research into the history of cybernetics, artificial intelligence (AI), and policy studies, it argues that the ongoing digital transformation and the expansion of the algorithmic public sphere does not solve but amplifies the problem of cultural participation, challenging the ‘participatory turn’ in cultural policy, defined as cultural policy’s re-orientation to encourage participation of different stakeholders at different stages of policymaking. This process is analysed through two cases: the postponing of a retrospective exhibition of the painter Philip Guston in the United States and the pre-emptive ban of a public art project centred on a monument for the Soviet Lithuanian writer Petras Cvirka in Lithuania. In both cases, risk management through pre-emption backfired and revealed the lack of institutional preparedness to foresee and deal with the digital social.},

The project received the ALIA 2016 research award and was undertaken by a collaboration of the ALIA/Health Libraries Australia and Health Libraries Inc groups. The research aimed to explore the contributions made by Australian hospital libraries to assist their organisations to achieve accreditation against the National Safety and Quality for Health Services (NSQHS) Standards. The research clearly demonstrates that hospital libraries are integral to a hospital’s quality and safety systems. They make substantial and essential contributions through their professional information/knowledge management services and by ensuring access to evidence-based resources. The research found that there are varying levels of contributions, however, and it is suggested that these differences may be influenced by variables such as location and size of hospital. It is further suggested that for hospitals without a library service, or those with libraries that have limited capacity to deliver professional services and resources, there is likely to be an ‘evidence-accessibility gap’, and they may be at risk and not performing as well as they could in regard to NSQHS accreditation standards, and safety and quality systems.},

A literature review was conducted to identify studies of ebook usage and factors affecting the balance between print and ebook usage in hospital and health libraries around the world. In 2014, the authors collated data about the Library's print and ebook collections: collection size, expenditure on print books and ebooks, and usage statistics. The literature review showed that in health/hospital libraries, the use of ebooks was increasing, with static or declining use of print collections. Factors affecting use included availability, accessibility (to content and technical mechanisms) and discoverability, with some flexibility around format preference. Cost and other limitations were ongoing challenges for health libraries. Data collected for this case study indicated a reversal in the balance between usage of print and ebooks, with about 30% print versus 70% electronic being the proportion reached in 2014. On average, the cost per download of an ebook was almost double the cost of a print book loan. Trends and factors affecting use as identified in the literature review were reinforced in this case study. A number of changes in the local context have affected the ability of the Library's clients to use the collections. Although it is not possible to say how these will affect collection use in the next few years, it is likely that with an increasing client base, coupled with improved availability and accessibility of ebooks, overall ebook usage will increase, accompanied by a drop in average cost per download.},

   abstract = {Grey literature is of inestimable value, with the potential for significant contributions to further inquiry and practice especially in academia and national development. Researchers, students, lecturers and scientists, depend on these resources which are often the main sources of indigenous and firsthand information. The challenge is retrieval, since they lack meaningful bibliographic control. They are usually not peer-reviewed and sometimes are of poor quality because they often originate from technocrats, scholars and scientists in various fields. A 2019 survey done in Jamaica with librarians from the Scientific and Technical Information Network (STIN) reveals the low status accorded to grey literature. Participants indicated that there is no active thrust towards advocacy and promotion. However, they recognize their importance and would willingly assist in organizing them. Digitization and archiving in repositories allow for greater accessibility to grey literature in academia. This paper examined the value of grey literature and presented digital accessibility as an infrastructure in overcoming associated challenges. Digitization’s value is seen in the regeneration of archiving, the increase in the use of non-circulating resources in special collections such as theses and dissertations, and in the preservation of collections. Digitization offers an online presence which raises awareness of existing collections and builds the image of academic institutions. This paper presents some best practices used in digitization, and key steps in the digitization process. The paper is qualitative and utilizes archival study to showcase the efforts of The University of the West Indies (The UWI) Mona Library in using digital technology to manage grey literature and promote their special collections. The authors concluded that through digitization this Library can act as a driver to galvanize other information units to effect greater bibliographic control. Once these valuable collections become accessible, they can be positioned to contribute to national and international development.},

   abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients undergo infectious exacerbations whose frequency identifies a clinically meaningful phenotype. Mouse models have been mostly used to separately study both COPD and the infectious processes, but a reliable model of the COPD frequent exacerbator phenotype is still lacking. Accordingly, we first established a model of single bacterial exacerbation by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infection on mice with emphysema-like lesions. We characterized this single exacerbation model combining both noninvasive in vivo imaging and ex vivo techniques, obtaining longitudinal information about bacterial load and the extent of the developing lesions and host responses. Bacterial load disappeared 48 hours post-infection (hpi). However, lung recovery, measured using tests of pulmonary function and the disappearance of lung inflammation as revealed by micro-computed X-ray tomography, was delayed until 3 weeks post-infection (wpi). Then, to emulate the frequent exacerbator phenotype, we performed two recurrent episodes of NTHi infection on the emphysematous murine lung. Consistent with the amplified infectious insult, bacterial load reduction was now observed 96 hpi, and lung function recovery and disappearance of lesions on anatomical lung images did not happen until 12 wpi. Finally, as a proof of principle of the use of the model, we showed that azithromycin successfully cleared the recurrent infection, confirming this macrolide utility to ameliorate infectious exacerbation. In conclusion, we present a mouse model of recurrent bacterial infection of the emphysematous lung, aimed to facilitate investigating the COPD frequent exacerbator phenotype by providing complementary, dynamic information of both infectious and inflammatory processes.},

Moreover, it reveals and verifies three trending areas that focus on dynamics, digitalisation, and business ecosystem. Based on these findings, this research proposes a concept of ecosystem-oriented business mode which reflect the three trending features. The research findings offer insights to entrepreneurs and ecosystem organisations regarding the current business model in digital transformation and its potential economic impact.},

   abstract = {With digitalisation, the male-dominated bioeconomy sector becomes intertwined with the male-dominated tech sector. We focus on the effects on gender equality within the bioeconomy sector when these two gender unequal sectors are merged. We review the existing literature by studying three concepts–bioeconomy, digitalisation and gender–as a way to highlight the current state of knowledge on gender in the Nordic digitalised bioeconomy. Through this investigation we provide directions for future research and suggest actions to be taken. The contemporary literature discusses two major areas of focus: the impact of history on today’s situation and gender inequality as a women’s issue. We propose four areas of future research focus: moving beyond a historical perspective, understanding the effectiveness of women-only activities, focusing on men’s role in gender equality work, and developing sustainability. We identify four points of action for practitioners in the literature: female role models, mentorship programmes, networks for young professionals and students and incorporating gender into bioeconomy-related education. However, together with the proposed future research, we suggest two considerations when practitioners in the Nordic digitalised bioeconomy take action: being mindful of the purpose and structure of women-only activities and including men when working with gender issues.},

Such dynamic development involves manifold interactions between multiple actor types captured as value co-creation (VCC). Esports players comprise a key and specific group of actors. With various levels of professionalisation, they attract huge audiences in stadiums and on screen. Empirical insights can reveal the players’ perspective of VCC and thus inform managerial decision-making. This study’s primary purpose is to contextualise, specify and measure VCC in esports as a reliable and valid concept. Also, by applying structural equation modelling, VCC’s impact on satisfaction with the service and financial rewards is empirically tested. Media companies benefit from tapping into esports players’ resources in co-creation activities to venture into this prospering industry.},

   abstract = {Policymakers in Europe have embraced the notion that they can and should drive economic growth by promoting digital technology. Efforts to do so, known as ‘digital transformation’, involve reallocating labour and capital to more efficient uses, especially those that produce technological innovation. Recent research has shed light on the politics of updating institutions for education and skills training, but we know little about the politics of reallocating capital in the current episode of economic upgrading, despite the specific and sizable costs of producing technological innovation. What strategies are policymakers implementing to finance technological innovation, especially in Europe’s periphery, where states lack fiscal resources? Focusing on the case of Portugal, this article illustrates the centrality of development financial institutions to financing technological innovation, identifying a distinct type of digital transformation in Europe’s periphery, where the state plays a marginal role in governing key aspects of economic upgrading. Instead, private finance allocates capital, and international organisations like the European Commission design policies to govern capital allocation. This article develops a framework for analysing the politics of digital transformation in Europe’s periphery that centres transnational actors and institutions, rather than the state, in directing the path of technological and structural change.},

This article explores how tech and venture capital successfully lobbied for financial liberalization at the beginning of digital transformation in the United States. The article argues that explaining the role of social blocs in digital transformation requires incorporating discourse analysis and develops a conceptual framework around three causal mechanisms in the dynamics of social blocs: formation, influence, and endurance. This framework contributes to theory development in the growth models perspective and improves our understanding of the character of business power in digital transformation.},

This paper examines contemporary approaches to work-based learning and explores the effect of organisational and workforce demands in a volatile era of global economic uncertainty. Theoretical and conceptual foundations relating to experiential learning, digital education and communities of learning are analysed and discussed. Taking an inductive qualitative approach, the study analyses semi-structured questionnaire data from senior leaders. The widespread adoption of technology exposes challenges to facilitation and the academic-employer interface, impacting upon learning communities and knowledge exchange opportunities. The findings also suggest enhanced leaders’ adaptive traits, including confidence and self-reliance. This study illuminates critical issues associated with contemporary work-based learning, specifically relating to prolonged macro uncertainty and the effect upon workplaces as sites of knowledge and learning, and risks to dynamic relationships between the psychosocial work environment, genuine opportunities to learn and learner well-being.

The present study explores how their ambitions and educational goals affect their approaches to leadership for digital transformation in their schools. The study employs an exploratory and qualitative research approach based on interviews with a full sample of nine upper secondary school principals from Central Switzerland. Transcripts have been analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The findings suggest that all principals express a clear orientation toward student-oriented teaching when integrating technology in their schools. However, there are substantial differences in terms of leadership processes to address this change: One principal oriented toward transformational leadership reported more rapid and more profound changes than all the principals oriented toward a more transactional type of leadership. In this case, transformational leadership is associated with faster implementation of digital technologies and also with a clearer focus on educational goals rather than on tools. This study expands the knowledge on principals’ technology leadership practices as it provides insights into school leaders’ attitudes and concepts and highlights the benefits of transformational leadership.},

Mathematics anxiety comprises negative feelings pertaining to a person’s engagement with mathematics. While much research into mathematics anxiety concentrates on students in second-level and higher education, there has been a paucity of research focusing on mature students learning service mathematics, and particularly in an Irish context. The drive to widen access to undergraduate education means that more and more mature students engage with programmes with obligatory service mathematics courses. The current study employs a quantitative approach to investigate mathematics anxiety among mature students learning service mathematics in Ireland. A survey was administered comprising biographical questions and the Mathematics Anxiety Scale U.K. (MAS-U.K.). The findings demonstrate that mathematics anxiety exists among this cohort, with situations of mathematics evaluation resulting in higher levels of mathematics anxiety. The findings also critique the MAS-U.K. as a method of investigating mathematics anxiety among mature students, and present suggestions for effectively using the scale in future studies.},

This article examines the recruitment practices of 13 leading corporations in high-growth sectors in India. Based on detailed qualitative interviews, it explains why these corporations are unlikely to increase the demand for graduates in ways imagined by policy-makers or proponents of skills-biased technological change. Companies in India are locked into an intense ‘war for talent’, but only for graduates in India’s top-tier universities. We argue that there is a close correspondence between India’s highly elitist university system and corporate talent management strategies, creating a narrow pool of highly mobile Indian corporate elite, but resulting in limited prospects for the wider Indian workforce. In this talent market, the success of the top corporate elite rests on keeping the elitist character of higher education, rather than widening labour market opportunities. This paper also seeks to explain why top corporations in India engage in this ‘war for talent’ when they are not always certain their investments pay off.},

Now more than ever, there is a strong need for digital transformation in AEC. The improvement in the accessibility of consumer-based head-mounted displays (HMD) is attracting different entertainment and research fields to immersive virtual reality (VR) applications. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is known as a promising technology in AEC. The full potential of BIM is not yet employed to empower this field, however, and this could be a result of some barriers still to be surmounted by BIM in both technological and management perspectives. One of these barriers is the communication and collaboration between design, construction, operation, and maintenance phases. VR can fill this gap by providing additional capabilities for BIM which either were not available before or were not possible to employ in practical ways.

As manufacturers are shifting towards digital transformation driven by big data, business analytics is becoming a dominant methodology for strategic decision-making in business management research. In response to this emerging phenomenon, the purpose of the current study is to provide a thorough literature review of the applicability of big data in manufacturing, with a perspective to exploring various research trends in this field and identifying the scope of potential investigations in the future. This study uses bibliometric and visual analysis approaches to systematically identify and analyse research articles from leading business journals in the Scopus database. The study sample included 89 research articles published in ABDC A*/A category journals to map thematic evolution and conceptual clusters related to keywords of ‘big data’, ‘business analytics’ and ‘manufacturing’. Using factorial analysis in Biblioshiny software, the study presents three research clusters in which researchers shall be encouraged to expand the big data/business analytics research in the context of manufacturing.},

   abstract = {Supply chains are increasingly being virtualized in response to globalization and emerging market challenges. Virtualization requires technical innovation using IoT technologies such as smart sensors, and it allows to transmit quality information across the chain. Associated organizational innovation is complex, especially in SME-dominated supply chains, and relies upon intensive knowledge exchange, discussions and negotiation. However, the development of solutions to address socio-institutional barriers to virtual supply chains has been under-researched up to now. This study analyses barriers to virtualization faced in SME-dominated supply chains, that is, the Dutch floriculture. The second step is developing a solution to core barriers in the form of a dedicated simulation game, the ‘Virtual Flower Chain’. Design and experiences are shown. The barriers that the game addresses are a sector-wide lack of cooperation, consumer focus, and sense of urgency, as well as a limited understanding of virtualization. The validation through game sessions shows that 87% of the participants gained more insights about the benefits of virtualization technologies and the willingness to collaborate, rather than blaming others, increased to 89% after the game. Game participants achieved more awareness of their position in a larger system, rather than as an isolated business.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the language industry has undergone a technological revolution, and professionals are increasingly required to have strong technological knowledge and expertise. Undergraduate translation programmes have tried to adapt to these changing market demands, albeit at a much slower pace. However, there still seems to be a significant gap between the increasingly challenging technological demands of the translation market and training in translation technologies (TT) in university degree courses. A previous empirical study investigating the presence of technology in undergraduate translation module syllabi showed that there is little integration of TT into translation modules. This paper presents a follow-up study, the primary goal of which is to comprehensively describe this situation with the testimonies of a cohort of translation trainers in Spanish higher-education institutions at undergraduate level. We expect to contribute to the field by reporting on the challenges experienced by trainers who are trying to integrate technologies into their practical translation modules. Findings show that there is little integration of TT into the teaching methodology of translation modules. This is due, in most cases, to factors that are beyond trainers’ control.},

Through a detailed case study of the background, structure and impact of Industry 4.0 in the Spanish regions of the Basque Country and Catalonia, the work demonstrates how it is not possible to define a policy of promoting Industry 4.0 that is generalizable to all regions and how each region will have to adapt the design and implementation of its Industry 4.0 policies to the specific characteristics of its regional innovation system. Therefore the replication of policies from other regions will not be an effective mechanism for promoting Industry 4.0 since the transition to Industry 4.0 is a very regional specific and diverse process.},

Additionally, stakeholder engagement indirectly and positively mediates the relationship between DESG and brand equity. Meanwhile, customer loyalty significantly mediates DESG and brand equity, and the combination of stakeholder engagement and customer loyalty jointly and significantly mediates the relationship between DESG and brand equity. Furthermore, DESG and brand equity indirectly and significantly impact rural banks’ financial performance during the study.

Although the use of PMSs has been identified as beneficial in the Industry 4.0 context, relatively little research exists on the digital governance that enables firms to lead and control digital processes. The paper posits that digital governance plays an important role in mediating the relationship between PMS use and Industry 4.0 maturity. The data were gathered from 280 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which operate in the service and manufacturing industry in Finland. The results demonstrate that different types of PMSs use cannot provide Industry 4.0 maturity alone, so there is a need for digital governance to fuel different types of PMS use, hence leading to Industry 4.0 maturity. However, diagnostic use of PMSs significantly hinders digital governance, while the interactive use of PMSs significantly drives digital governance. Finally, digital governance facilitates Industry 4.0 maturity.},

In such a turbulent scenario, companies, and especially small and medium-sized enterprise, must dynamically respond to this environment by undertaking a strategic transformation which involves changes in the organisation structure through the right digital interface and mechanisms to creating qualitative customer relationships and capturing value. Business success over time is built on leadership, people-based management, continuous improvements, management based on facts and constant customer focus. The evolutionary path of a firm’s business model driven by digitalisation describes its maturity. This paper aims at assessing the relationship between digital business model maturity and the sustainability of business performance over time. The results of an online survey involving the executives of 162 small and medium-sized enterprise operating in the tourism sector of five different continents have been analysed to test this relationship. Through a Structural Equations Modelling approach, the study found statistical evidence of the positive effect of digital business model maturity on sustainable business success. In this manner, this study contributes to academic literature by linking the concepts of digital transformation, digital business model maturity and sustainable business excellence.},

   abstract = {Small and medium-sized firms are increasingly adopting digital technologies to transform themselves. Yet, the ability of top-management teams to embark on strategic transformations depends on entrepreneurial ideas and initiatives that arise across the firm. We conducted a qualitative pre-study of manufacturing companies to understand their challenges in engaging in and implementing digital transformation. The study drew attention to the prevalence of internal secrecy that inhibits knowledge sharing across units and, therefore, complicates the identification and elaboration of customer-centric innovations based on digital data. Building on our initial findings and research, we then developed and tested hypotheses that relate organisational secrecy, competitive pressures, and the range of digital technologies in use to top management’s shift in focus towards digital innovation. We find, in particular, that organisational secrecy impeds a shift in top management attention towards those forms of digital innovation that require complex cross-unit coordination. We also found that perceived external pressures from competition were associated with an increase in top management’s focus on digital innovation. Our study contributes to the literature on digital transformation and strategy processes more generally by elaborating on how organisational secrecy can hamper strategic renewal. The findings suggest that a culture of openness and transparency can facilitate strategic renewal in established companies.},

   abstract = {The digital transformation involves both risks and opportunities for the sustainability of global supply chains. This systematic literature review of 64 peer-reviewed English journal articles aims to show how the adoption of digital technologies is related to (sustainable) supply chain management practices and associated sustainable outcomes. (Non)existing relationships between these constructs will be examined, which has not been done previously. Content, frequency, and contingency analyses are conducted from a practice-based view. The study reveals three main topics in the literature: (1) a mainstream eco-efficiency debate; (2) supplemented by a data-driven, comprehensive long-term perspective on environmental sustainability; and (3) hard-to-measure substantive sustainability aspects that can be fostered by communication, selective monitoring and certification. An integrated perspective of these three topics is proposed to facilitate a more viable sustainability approach. Based on the identified (non)existing relationships, researchers and practitioners learn about the digital technologies and practices they can use to improve supply chain sustainability. Importantly, it should be recognised that hardly quantifiable targets and related practices are obscured by large datasets. Future research should focus on the integration of economic aspects to ensure the compatibility of long-term substantial sustainability goals and the profitability of the entire supply chain.},

Based on a corpus of newspaper articles, we use a multi-dimensional approach combining content, framing, and metaphor analysis to expose how media report about the digital transformation in the German Mittelstand. In terms of contents, media focus on technical issues, narrowing down the scope of digital transformation. Articles with a main focus on digital transformation show a more positive tonality compared to those with a minor focus. We identified four distinct media narratives. The negative narrative portrays the Mittelstand as in need of help to master the digital transformation, with sickness and military metaphors underlining the negative assessment. The positive narrative reinforces narrow stereotypes of who is successful with digital transformation. The future-oriented narrative evokes a desirable but vague imagined future of digital transformation. The chance-challenge narrative is the only one portraying the Mittelstand both openly and implicitly as being capable of mastering the digital transformation, not least because this narrative also relies on external experts who provide a more varied picture. We contribute to the growing body of narrative entrepreneurship research by illustrating the various mechanisms media use to create a predominantly negative and sceptical assessment of the Mittelstand and its digital transformation.},

An increasing number of established companies from traditional industries have begun to explore the potential of innovation platforms. These companies are often organised as multi-business organisations (MBOs). When introducing innovation platforms, they face tensions between the corporate centre that runs such platforms and business units that develop applications on the platform. Established approaches to information technology (IT) governance in MBOs are ineffective in addressing these tensions because they focus on cross-business-unit synergies, rather than on innovation from business units. To explore this issue further, we conducted a longitudinal case study of an automotive manufacturer that introduced an innovation platform in its infotainment system. The company faced four tensions: rigidity, alteration, mistrust, and competition. To address these tensions, the company evolved its IT governance, allowing for more flexibility for business units, supporting their development efforts, and prioritising them over external complementors. The role of the corporate centre evolved from a gatekeeper to an enabler of innovation. Our findings link the literature on IT governance in MBOs with that of platform governance, providing insights into how MBOs benefit from innovation platforms.},

A strong innovative performance of the EU in this technology field depends inter alia on the extent to which the bundling of resources for innovative activities is achieved and disparities in innovative activities between its member states are overcome. Focusing on Horizon 2020, we trace disparities of knowledge generation in ICT across the geographical dimension and the network dimension. We apply descriptive and analytical statistics as well as network analysis to the CORDIS database and connect our findings to the distribution of power between EU member states and other countries associated with Horizon 2020. We then investigate whether there is power-law behaviour in our empirical data. We find a rather unequal distribution of power between countries that manifests in country size, per capita income and member status in the EU. Future innovation policy needs to prioritise a more cohesive and egalitarian European knowledge base in this strategic technology field and cope with the current imbalances in the distribution of power.},

   abstract = {The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a new global policy to guide the way countries collectively manage and transform the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of people and the planet over the next 15 years. Achieving sustainable development presents all countries and the global policy community with a set of significant development challenges that are almost entirely geographic in nature. Many of the issues impacting sustainable development can be analyzed, modeled, and mapped within a geographic context, which in turn can provide the integrative framework necessary for global collaboration, consensus and evidence-based decision-making. However, and despite significant advances in geospatial information technologies, there is a lack of awareness, understanding and uptake, particular at the policy and decision-making level, of the vital and integrative role of geospatial information and related enabling architectures such as National Spatial Data Infrastructures. This paper reasons that the role of geospatial information in contributing to sustainable development has not adequately been described by either the sustainable development policy practice or by the geospatial professional community. This lack of policy and guidance, with commensurate critical gaps and connection points with national geospatial frameworks, is a visible impediment to developing countries and those most affected by the challenges and need to achieve sustainable development. The global geospatial community now has a unique opportunity to integrate and connect geospatial information into the global development agenda in a more holistic and sustainable manner, specifically in contributing their data resources toward measuring and monitoring the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and their 169 associated targets, through the global indicator framework that anchors the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

However, recent studies have also pointed out that the tourism-growth nexus may be conditional on certain elements like development level and infrastructure, education and human capital among others. Another factor which is believed to moderate the tourism-growth link is the level of digitalisation of the destination country and this research claims that countries with higher levels of digitalisation could benefit from increased tourism economic benefits. This study analyses the moderating role of such digitalisation in the tourism-growth link. The research uses annual panel data of 28 small island economies from 1990 to 2019 and applies panel autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) methodology to analyse the long-run and short-run relationship among the variables. Results confirm the Tourism-led growth hypothesis in both the long run and short run, but more importantly point out that this relationship is moderated or is conditional by the level of digitalisation. In fact, the economic benefit of tourism is found to be higher with increased digitalisation level. Panel Granger Causality tests confirm the causal effect of digitalisation on tourism development as well as a bi-directional causality between tourism development and economic growth. The implications are clear that government and tourism businesses should accelerate the digitalisation process and concentrate on the concept of e-tourism to maximise its return.},

This process belongs to the class of inverse problems or model calibration. For this problem, the approximated nonlinear least squares (ANLS) method based on a Gaussian process (GP) metamodel has been employed by some researchers. A potential drawback of the ANLS method is that the metamodel is built only once and not updated thereafter. To address this difficulty, we propose an iterative algorithm in this study. In the proposed algorithm, the parameters of the simulation code and GP metamodel are alternatively re-estimated and updated by maximum likelihood estimation and the ANLS method. This algorithm uses both computer and experimental data repeatedly until convergence. A study using toy-models including inexact computer code with bias terms reveals that the proposed algorithm performs better than the ANLS method and the conditional-likelihood-based approach. Finally, an application to a nuclear fusion simulation code is illustrated.},

   abstract = {Order picking (OP) is a time- and labour-intensive operation in which human-system errors can lead to deficiencies in quality. This study aimed to identify human factors-related failure modes that cause human-system errors and quality deficits in OP. We conducted a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews with 38 order pickers employed by 14 different companies in four countries. The literature review found 46 papers that identified eight different failure modes related to OP system design: physical workload, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, complexity, memory demand, vision, hearing, and motivation. The interview results confirmed many of the same factors noted in the literature review but also identified communication and supervision failure modes that had not been addressed before. The results illustrate human factors-related failure modes linked to OP system design, operation, and management that ultimately increase quality deficits and pick errors. Further research on human factors and OP system design interaction is warranted, as no assessment tool has been found to support engineers and managers seeking to improve system designs to reduce pick errors.},

   abstract = {How do leaders across different hierarchies motivate employees’ job performance in the new digital age? In order to answer this under-investigated question, we first conceptualise digital performance as employees’ job performance that is attained through using the new generation of digital technologies and then propose a research model that integrates and differentiates the influential mechanisms of the dual leadership factors–top management support and transformational supervisory leadership–regarding employees’ digital-enabled task performance and innovative performance. Specifically, we tested the research model with two different samples, including 230 sales personnel from a large automobile manufacturing company and 206 employees from multiple joint ventures across different industries. We find that top management support exhibits a stronger influence on digital-enabled task performance than on innovative performance through the mediation of data-driven culture, while transformational supervisory leadership nurtures a stronger effect on digital-enabled innovative performance than on task performance through the mediation of digital self-efficacy. Our study consolidates and extends the technology use literature on management support and advances IS leadership theory to the digital context. Our findings also offer practical insights into the effective use of the new generation of digital technologies in organisations.},

   abstract = {In 2017, the newly-elected, Labor-led government of New Zealand boldly declared access to higher-education to be a universal right and committed to a year’s “fees-free” studentship, with the promise of eventually extending it to an entire first-degree programme. Against such a backdrop, this article will examine the role of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as surrogates for “fees-free” higher education and whether the design of such a Higher Education 4.0 platform is even a credible proposition. More specifically, the research question addressed is: can higher education be made universal in terms of access and costs through the intermediation of MOOCs? The case attempts to provide a socio-technical view of such a “value proposition” and concludes that the charter of higher education extends beyond the distribution of knowledge and skills that may perhaps be better delivered with blended learning models than MOOC platforms. A university is more than a certification of core-competencies in that it also brings about socialization and participation. With the undercurrent of design ideals such as “tech for good”, the academic community must examine whether MOOCs are credible substitutes or at-best, complementary platforms. In this era of Industry 4.0, higher education should not be about the creative destruction of what we value in universities, but their digital transformation. Regretfully, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed gaping holes in the sectors’ readiness for online learning. The article concludes with an agenda for large Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) driven by Action Design Research that could fulfil the aspirations of the key stakeholder groups–students, faculty and regulators. It is intended that the case will inform policy makers on the implementation of a Blended Learning platform which draws from the relative strengths of traditional and online delivery.},

The publishing industry is also facing digital transformation, and the traditional paper business is considered polluted and wasteful as it generates carbon emissions. To compare the influence of digital paperless business with the traditional one on environmental performance in publishing, this paper adopts a refined weak disposability model initially introduced by Kuosmanen (2005). The main novelty of the paper is to include two types of desirable outputs in production technology: one is linked to generating undesirable outputs while another is not. Two additional economic assumptions can be imposed on environmental production technology, namely, weak disposability and null-jointness, respectively. We apply the refined model to assess the economic and environmental performance of the publishing industry in China. The paper business generates carbon emissions while the digital outputs (paperless business) may not produce pollution. The empirical results indicate that a vast potential improvement is detected for the digital outputs while limited progress is allowed for traditional outputs. Furthermore, we use the entropy method to obtain a comprehensive digital technology indicator and further explore its influence on performance in the publishing industry.},

Therefore, this study takes Wenzhou as an example to examine the textual content of innovation policy documents using text analysis method and construct a quantitative framework for innovation policy evaluation. Then we use the PMC-AE index model to evaluate representative policies. The results show that the textual content of the policies is reasonable and in line with the real needs. However, there is still room for improvement, including enriching the nature of the policy, strengthening the combination and application of policy tools, extending the policy’s target population and boosting the incentive and guarantee measures of the policy. Both theoretical and practical ramifications emerge from our research. We offer an empirical foundation for the revision, creation, and improvement of the municipal innovation policy on the one hand, while our research also improves the process for assessing policy texts.},

Conservatism without an improved understanding of risks, however, does not cushion against unexpected consequences. Risk scenarios associated with asset failure and inventory shortage are frequently observed in practice. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technology is unlocking new methods that attain significant prediction accuracy for these risk factors. IoT-enabled predictions on asset state of health can drive dynamic decision models that conduct maintenance and replenishment actions more efficiently while reducing risk. In this study, we propose a unified framework that utilizes IoT data to jointly optimize condition-based maintenance and inventory decisions. We formulate our problem as a stochastic mixed-integer program that accounts for the interplay between maintenance, spare parts inventory, and asset reliability. We introduce a new reformulation that is efficient for solving large-scale instances of the proposed model. The framework presented herein is applied to real world degradation data to demonstrate the benefits of our methodology in terms of cost and reliability.},

Drawing on qualitative data from a series of structured interviews and focus groups with MBOMs and other key stakeholders in the Irish MB digital ecosystem, we identity three MBOM digital transformer archetypes comprising unique configurations of MBOMs’ growth and technology mindsets, namely: champion digital transformers, emerging digital transformers, and aspiring digital transformers. For each of these archetypes, we explore the different learning capabilities and mechanisms through which MBOMs manage and sustain their digital transformation efforts.

   abstract = {In recent times, a paradigm shift is observed in the manufacturing domain through the inception of the smart manufacturing (SM) system. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries are striving hard to catch up with this transition. Thus, a need arises to assess their preparedness and subsequently develop an appropriate mechanism for transition. In this context, readiness assessment is a suitable approach that clearly depicts the quantification and qualification of readiness stages through various dimensions. To this effect, this study proposes a generic readiness assessment model with 5 stages, 6 building blocks, and 22 dimensions. Furthermore, the dimensions are ranked using ‘Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA)’ to understand their influence on overall readiness attainment. The practical viability of the proposed readiness assessment model is tested on five Indian SMEs. Based on the readiness level of each organization, recommendations are made to further improve their preparedness for transformation. Other SMEs can utilize this tool as a self-assessment methodology to check their status and subsequently strategize their policies for future transformation.},

   abstract = {Positive Energy Buildings (PEBs) represent an emerging paradigm for high performance in the building sector. This paradigm focuses on the possibility of exploiting the interaction between individual NZEBs and smart Smart Grids, using energy surplus exchange. Acknowledging this technical potential, building sector should re-think the role of individual buildings as nodes of intelligent energy infrastructures with large penetration of distributed renewable energy resources. This requires a better understanding of the emerging properties related to PEBs and an organisation of new alliances across sectors in order to put PEBs nets into practice. However, there is no evidence of a comprehensive socio-technical framework concerning PEBs nets working at scale. This paper aims to fill this gap. Through a literature review, based on Constructive Grounded Theory Method, it proposes a new conceptual framework focused on Buildings-as-Energy-Service as a key enabler for creating PEBs nets. Research findings are organised according to four integrated lines of research, which describe: the trajectory towards PEBs nets; the management of new alliances across sectors; the definition of an ecosystem of applications for PEBs; and, the socio-technical implications in putting PBEs into practice. These research lines may contribute to re-inventing the role of the building sector in delivering tailor-made products and services for a low carbon society. Thus, academic and non-academic stakeholders in the fields of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Planning might find this conceptual framework useful, as it summarises significant potential interactions among these sectors, emerging from recent studies. Highlights A conceptual framework is proposed as a key enabler for creating PEBs nets. New peculiarities offered by PEBs nets are conceptualised The importance of re-thinking buildings as active nodes in infrastructures is motivated. Knowledge fragmentation is recomposed to reshape building sector alliances. Exploratory research, based on the Constructive Grounded Theory method, is conducted.},

   abstract = {The arrival of the pandemic which has affected the entire world, in addition to spreading fear due to the initial inability to manage the health crisis, has increased the fluidity and uncertainty in today’s society. The system of social security itself has not only changed its contents, combining primordial material welfare with a relational type of well-being, but also its form. We have gone from the more conventional form of face-to-face relationships to the more innovative methods making us talk about e-welfare with the use of digital technology. If on the one hand the latter has removed the space-time barriers, connoting itself as smart welfare, on the other hand it has generated a digital divide, with the creation of the digitally poor. During the pandemic, schools, health care and social services have had to invent new operational methods on an experimental level by using cutting-edge organisations to meet their new needs. The aim of the article is therefore to shed light on these changes which are taking place by highlighting the operational and ethical implications of digitalisation in order to find a new approach to social work which has been seen as ‘a beacon in the night of the pandemic’.},

   abstract = {Debates on the future trajectory of Germany’s digital transformation have recently entered mainstream party politics. Rather than forming a coherent trend, however, some parties have begun to signal a much stronger commitment to digital policies than others. Drawing on the issue competition literature, we address two questions: First, which parties strongly emphasise digital policies in their policy portfolios, and do they exhibit clear commonalities? Second, is there a uniform tendency or are there systematic differences regarding the aspects of digital change that these parties emphasise the most? Our evidence points towards a negative status quo rather than being a winner of the political game as a necessary condition for parties to show major shifts in their policy portfolios. We also find a trend of homogenisation regarding the issue areas in which digital policies are emphasised. The studied parties thus seem to have a shared understanding about what matters most, rather than systematically taking up digitisation on issues on which they already have issue ownership. Altogether, our analysis sheds light on how digital policies as an emerging topic gain traction on the supply-side of party politics.},

This paper aims (i) to provide a complex system perspective of the challenges confronting LAUs and (ii) to propose guidelines for managers of LAUs to address them in practice. A multidisciplinary group was formed and conducted an iterative process of research, brainstorming and debate of potential solutions to the following problems considered particularly important by their universities: mental health issues in the university environment, student learning gaps, brain drain, and anti-science movements. Complexity theory and E/HF concepts are integrated to demonstrate that understanding what LAUs are experiencing in a fragmented manner is impossible, and that the interactions between the challenges should be at the centre of the managers’ actions plans. Practitioner summary: Managers of LAUs can benefit from the guidelines proposed to understand the pressing challenges confronting universities and develop systemic approaches to address them.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Omnichannel is a trend also reaching events and their participants. So naturally, the trade fairs will be confronted with this reality of digital transformation. Given that exhibitors generally have the primacy of deciding to participate or not in a trade fair, this study aims to take this further, developing a representative model of exhibitors’ perception of an omnichannel trade fair. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative approach through a survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used on the data collected from 306 Portuguese B2B exhibitors. Within the SEM method, the multi-group causal analysis was also used to analyze the moderating role of the type of exhibitors (between industries and B2B service). Findings: A new model is described, incorporating the causal relationships between exhibitors’ perceived compatibility with omnichannel trade fairs and consequent engagement and loyalty. The model reveals the exhibitors’ understanding of omnichannel compatibility with the trade fair’s context, positively influencing their engagement and loyalty. The results also reveal no significant differences between the types of exhibitors (industries and B2B service). Research implications: Trade fairs continue to be excellent business-to-business (B2B) marketing tools, and the intensity of the use of digital technologies at events will lead to new challenges and opportunities. But few studies have investigated this topic. Thus, this research investigated the exhibitors’ perception of omnichannel trade fairs and their consequences on engagement and loyalty. Therefore, this research is a relevant contribution to the literature on B2B trade fairs and raises new research lights Practical implications: The great differential of omnichannel is precisely in integrating online and offline channels. This positive opening of exhibitors to omnichannel trade fairs extends multiple opportunities and challenges for exhibitors, organizers, and visitors. “Omnicanalization” of trade fairs will imply a convergence strategy that integrates all connectivity channels between the three parties. Originality/value: This study’s findings address the gap in trade fair literature concerning the lack of an omnichannel approach, which is a fresh and pertinent perspective.},

Transforming the operating activities, the internal processes or enhancing the relationships with the customers is vital for business success. However, the existing literature reveals gaps on how digital orientation and relational capacity can lead to performance gains. The study proposes a conceptual model by which companies’ digital orientation can lead to superior financial and non financial performance with the mediating role of relational capacity. Based on a sample of 224 companies the model was tested and validated through the Structural Equations Model. The results show that relational capacity is a key mediating variable between digital orientation and financial and nonfinancial performance. The study offers practical implications for companies about the importance of design digital marketing strategies to engage with customers if the company wants to increase performance. Moreover, the study stresses the value of maintain strong and durable relationships with customers and partners to enhance the relational capacity of companies. The theoretical contribution derives from testing a model that adds empirical evidence to the current state of knowledge and that could be used in future studies.},

Logistics 4.0 is a progressive and vital technology for the MSME sector in developed economies. However, certain inhibitors cause MSMEs to face criticality and difficulty when adopting Logistics 4.0. Therefore, the authors first identified fourteen inhibitors through a detailed structured literature review and then used the Delphi method to finalise the inhibitors for further analysis. Furthermore, the modified total interpretive structural modelling (M-TISM) technique was applied to identify the levels and interrelationships among the inhibitors. Subsequently, the inhibitors were categorised into four main clusters by their dependence and driving power using matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment (MICMAC) analysis. This study reveals that MSMEs must prioritise five critical inhibitors during the Logistics 4.0 adoption process. The authors also develop five propositions. Timely action on the recommendations can help MSMEs owners, managers, and employees quickly adopt Logistics 4.0. Finally, the authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications and future research directions for a better understanding of adopting Logistics 4.0.},

A total of 134 articles were retrieved from relevant databases and publisher engines between 2011 and June 2022. The analysis of these articles enabled us to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on Lean SS; the relationship between LM, SS and Industry 4.0 and the implications of their combination on operational excellence. The results show that while a majority of researchers consider Industry 4.0 to be a driver of LSS and a prerequisite for helping companies access the data and analytics needed, others find them to be complementary and synergistic. Similarly, various authors support the idea that LSS could be a facilitator of Industry 4.0. This study provides an overview of the main research streams in this field and its shortcomings and presents an LSS4.0 framework integrating Lean SS and Industry 4 which will be of great value to academics and practitioners working in this area.},

   abstract = {After the economic collapse in 2008, we observed rapid changes among media markets, digital transformation of information, and the increasing role of social networks in communication, anti-democratic forces use the freedom of speech and the press to share illiberal rhetoric. Considering these phenomena, this study aims to verify how ruling elites use militant democracy means in consolidated democracies to combat anti-democrats by restricting citizens’ fundamental freedoms to express their thoughts and beliefs. The main argument is that different threats for the freedom of speech and the press have occurred in a consolidated democracy: abusing regulations about hate speech crimes and public incitement to hatred, political interventions in the media system, violating relations between the media market and political system, favouring public media and avoiding using restrictions against them. The scope of those threats is different, resulting from using neo-militant instruments or replacing them with quasi-militant democracy means. The methods employed for the analysis are the qualitative analysis of sources and the quantitative analysis of data in the comparative perspective. Austria, Finland, and Sweden–three EU member states recognised as consolidated democracies, with a democratic corporatist model of media systems–were selected for the study.},

Small-scale farmers face significant challenges and barriers to adopting digital technology. This study contributes to the literature on digital development in three ways: present the economic, political, and social factors affecting digital adoption in the AVCs; highlight the implications for governance and institutional challenges;adds knowledge to the analytical value of the Choice Frameworkto study digital technology adoption. This paper after identifying more than 100 papers and articles, uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aligned with Cooper’s [(2010). Research synthesis and meta-analysis: A step-by-step approach (5th ed.). Sage] approach to examine 52 articles published from 2014 to 2019, ultimately selecting the most relevant 36 studies. The study uses the Choice Framework that operationalizes the Capabilities Approach (CA) as a theoretical window for this research. Papers were classified into four different categories: economic; political; social factors; institutional/governance. The findings show: - the role of the state in governance and institutional support is critical to facilitate the collaboration and participation of different actors;-the importance to develop a comprehensive localized developmental implementation framework that can support the adoption of digital solutions to support small-scale farmers. Limitations for this study are highlighted and areas for further research are suggested.},

Specifically, this article investigates the following research paradox: predictive analytics, as driven by a logic premised on predicting the future, lock Great State University into a never-ending present. Through Brian Massumi’s concept of a logic of preemption, this paper explores how a quest for proper predictive analytics locked this student success initiative into a hamster wheel of a never-ending present, where the only space and time of action was here and now. It is argued that the function of predictive analytics in higher education is to produce space and time through dividuation and continuous algorithmic variation, freezing both past and future and restricting spacetimes of change to the present.},

   abstract = {In a world where financial capital serves as the backbone of individual and societal economic health, understanding the mechanisms that can stimulate or hinder its accumulation is critical. This study explores how the accessibility of banking services and the integration of digital finance can influence the accumulation of financial wealth, as well as disparities in household savings. Drawing on data derived from the Finscope Consumer Survey for Togo 2016 and the Harmonized Living Standards Measurement Study 2018 for Togo, this study employs a range of analytical methodologies including propensity score matching, double difference, and smoothed instrumental variable quantile regression tools. The outcomes of this study underscore that access to banking services and digital finance significantly enhances physical asset investment and the adoption of sound financial practices rather than an increase in bank savings alone. Therefore, the emergence of digital finance can be seen as a missing link in the formal financial system’s ability to improve the efficiency of financial service provision and make a significant contribution to reducing inequalities in wealth accumulation. This study sheds light on the significant decrease in inequality concerning the capacity for wealth accumulation among households.},

   abstract = {Technology acceptance research has shown that trust is an important factor fostering use of information systems (IS). As a result, numerous IS researchers have studied factors that build trust in IS. However, IS research on trust has mainly focused on the trust relationship between the user and the IS itself, largely neglecting that other targets of trust might also drive IS use from a user's point of view. Accordingly, we investigate the importance of different targets of trust in IS use. Therefore, we use the concept of a network of trust and identify four different targets of trust that are prevalent from a user's point of view. Afterwards, we develop our research model and evaluate it using a free simulation experiment. The results show that multiple targets of trust are important in the context of IS use. In particular, we highlight the importance of a second target - trust in the provider - which is equally important as trust in the IS itself. Consequently, IS providers should focus not only on fostering users' trust in their IS but also on positioning themselves as trustworthy providers. In addition, we show that a third target - trust in the Internet - has significant indirect effects on multiple constructs that impact IS use.},

Although the adoption of digital technologies by firms has been studied extensively from a technical point of view, previous research lacks insight into the managerial aspects of digital transformation, which, given the transformation’s interdisciplinarity, might have substantial implications for information systems research. In particular, it is unclear how small and medium-sized family-controlled firms (known as family-owned Mittelstand firms) with resource constraints handle digital transformation. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on rich data from 127 semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study of 15 family-owned Mittelstand firms from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. All of these firms are active in the manufacturing industry but vary in terms of their digital transformation progress. Based on within-case and cross-case pattern analysis, we propose that the digital transformation of Mittelstand firms is a process consisting of three stages, namely, process digitalisation, product and service digitalisation, and business model digitalisation, and we reveal triggers for each stage and the dynamic capabilities needed throughout this process. Moreover, we identify three combinations of enablers and barriers that support or hinder the development of dynamic capabilities and thus accelerate or impede the advancement of the digital transformation process.},

A total of 515 masters’ level students from 7 universities participated in the survey. The participants were recruited by employing a two-stage stratified purposive total population sampling technique. The study findings confirmed that despite their preferences for print material, Millennials were using electronic material for reading more frequently. However, the study showed that the reading purpose influences the choice of the reading format. Furthermore, the availability of electronic reading content in the public domain and open access contents may be a reason for increased use of e-content, as free websites were the preferred method of millennials for obtaining reading material. Social networking websites and intelligent search engines like “Google” were also in use and play a role in finding the relevant information and reading e-content.

While digitalisation is perceived as an impetus for change, either due to the opportunities or threats it brings about, not all industries are able to change unlimitedly. We seek to understand digital transformation concerning products and services perceived to have a wider public value. Our empirical case is the newspaper industry in Norway, which has a strong collective identity tied to the societal function of independent journalism. We find that an industry with a resilient identity leaning towards preservation can learn how to use the digital space to adapt and innovate effectively. The adaptation and innovation processes are shaped by the interplay between the collective identity and the nature of digital work and innovation. The outcome is a continued emphasis on retaining the core mission but with an increasingly pragmatic approach to how and in what form it is safeguarded. Continuous collaborative experimentation and deliberation on the fit between innovations and the collective identity is a key change mechanism. Our study contributes to a better understanding of collective identities and their interplay with innovation.},

   abstract = {Research question: The number of studies dealing with digital innovation in sport marketing has increased rapidly in recent years. These studies address the global phenomenon of digital transformation and its impact on the field of sport marketing. However, most studies have not considered digital transformation in its full complexity nor analyzed its facets through the lens of value co-creation. Therefore, this article reconciles the fragmented research on digital transformation in sport marketing with the current understanding of value co-creation to develop an agenda for sport marketing research. Research methods: We conduct a systematic scoping review of the literature on digital transformation of value co-creation in sport marketing. The scoping review combines a database search and a manual search, in which we identified 270 relevant articles. Results and findings: Most studies on digital transformation in sport marketing relate to research about social media. Based on the scoping review, we reorder the literature from the perspective of value co-creation and identify relevant research gaps. Based on these research gaps, we develop an agenda for future research in sport marketing, including methodological approaches. Implications: This article provides scholars with a basis for innovative future research in the digital era of value co-creation in sport marketing and enhances the repertoire of sport managers for facing the challenges of digital transformation in the sport business.},

However, telemedicine is a discontinuous digital innovation, and incumbent health care organizations are lagging in its adoption. We combine research on IT innovation adoption and discontinuous innovation to study the relative role of two drivers of discontinuous innovation adoption: digital complementary assets and the regulatory environment. Our findings from 1,753 acute care hospitals across 30 European countries suggest that digital complementary assets have a stronger effect on telemedicine innovation adoption than the regulatory framework. In addition, we observe application- and business model-specific differences. Overall, our findings add the role of organizational versus regulatory drivers of discontinuous innovation adoption to information systems research, emphasize the importance of digital complementary assets for the adoption of discontinuous innovation by incumbent organizations, and provide new insights into how the diffusion of telemedicine innovation can be accelerated.},

Companies collect large volumes of real-time machine data and are seeking new ways to use it in furthering data-driven decision making. A challenge for these companies is identifying throughput bottlenecks using the real-time machine data they collect. This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm to better identify bottleneck groups and provide diagnostic insights. The algorithm is based on the active period theory of throughput bottleneck analysis. It integrates available manufacturing execution systems (MES) data from the machines and tests the statistical significance of any bottlenecks detected. The algorithm can be automated to allow data-driven decision making on the shop floor, thus improving throughput. Real-world MES datasets were used to develop and test the algorithm, producing research outcomes useful to manufacturing industries. This research pushes standards in throughput bottleneck analysis, using an interdisciplinary approach based on production and data sciences.},

However, despite the recent rapid growth of digital retailing and online shopping, the impact on travel behaviour remain poorly understood. Although the issue of the substitution and complementarity between conventional and virtual retail channels has been extensively explored, few attempts have been made to extend this work so as to incorporate virtual retail channels into modelling frameworks that can link shopping and mobility decisions. Here, we review the existing literature base with a focus on most relevant dimensions for personal mobility. How online activity can be incorporated into operational transport demand models and benefits of such effort are discussed. Existing frameworks of shopping demand are flexible and can, in principle, be extended to incorporate virtual shopping and the associated additional complexities. However, there are significant challenges associated with lack of standard ontologies for crucial concepts and insufficiencies in traditional data collection methods. Also, supply-side questions facing businesses and policy-makers are changing as retailing goes through a digital transformation.

It has the potential to weave positive changes to firms and impact organizational structure layers. Therefore, it provides an impetus for the collaboration of factories, suppliers, and customers. Nevertheless, due to the difference of Industry 4.0 vision among companies, there is a lack of unified perception and approach of its implementation roadmap. Therefore, many firms in both developed and developing countries that step in the way of digital transformation encounter not only organizational, technological, and operational challenges but are also compelled to cope with a large deal of confusion.

Through the extensive literature review and experts, twelve readiness criteria have been identified and validated. The relative importance weights of readiness criteria were determined by IVPF-AHP and the IIoT adoption readiness degree is calculated by IVPFS. The proposed approach enables manufacturers to make a rational decision on whether they are ready to initiate IIoT or take early remedial actions to increase the success rate of the adoption possibility.

Based on data representing the experiences of China’s listed commercial banks from 2013 to 2021, this study empirically examines the impact of the digital economy on credit risk by using a panel fixed-effect model. The findings indicate that the development of the digital economy helps to reduce credit risk faced by commercial banks. Institutional variables, such as financial supervision and the legal institutional environment, have significant mediation effects of the digital economy. By increasing the intensity of financial supervision and improving the legal institutional environment, the digital economy can reduce the credit risk faced by commercial banks. Interestingly, the effect of the digital economy on credit risk is not uniform across all banks. State-owned commercial banks benefit more from the digital economy in terms of reducing their credit risk than on non-state-owned banks. The inhibitory effect of the digital economy on the credit risk of commercial banks is significant in eastern China but not in central and western China.},

To address this issue, this study investigates the survival mechanisms of MSEs in the digital economy platform, including the barriers they encounter when adapting to sharing economy practices. Additionally, the study examines the digital literacy capabilities of MSE actors and the extent to which these capabilities impact the continuity of businesses involved in the sharing economy. Using a descriptive research approach with 300 MSE actors in East Java Province as respondents, this study reveals that, aside from receiving financial assistance, digitization is essential for MSEs to avoid failure. MSE actors, who previously relied solely on traditional channels for product marketing, are now compelled to use digital platforms and encouraged to participate in sharing economy practices. The study indicates that, despite the perceived benefits of MSE actors’ engagement in the sharing economy practice, the profit earned must be shared with the application owner, without any guarantee of proportionality to the risks they bear. Digital transformation, however, presents a unique opportunity for both new and established MSE actors to upgrade their businesses. Notably, online promotion is much more accessible and cost-effective, with options such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google Business. Nevertheless, the readiness of MSE actors to adopt digital transformation is uneven, as some possess outdated gadgets and inadequate digital literacy. Therefore, digital literacy training for MSE actors is a crucial need.},

As a result, IS projects have become increasingly ambitious in terms of both goals and scale, making it even more challenging for managers to exercise control over such projects. While prior research focused primarily on the direct and interactive effects of formal and informal control modes on IS project performance, recent research directs attention to the importance of considering project managers’ control styles (i.e., how managers interact with controlees to enact controls). Corresponding studies also indicate that “either/or” control approaches–as opposed to “both/and” approaches–are no longer viable in today’s complex environment. As such, our study draws on an ambidexterity perspective to theoretically develop and empirically test the direct and interactive effects of control-style ambidexterity on IS project performance. Using matched-pair data from 146 IS projects (from 146 high-tech firms), we find that control-style ambidexterity improves project performance–directly and in combination with both formal and informal control. The study results contribute novel insights regarding the effective control of IS projects in the digital era and help explain mixed findings in prior literature, thereby facilitating continued theory development in the research area.},

It sets out to refine the broad category of ‘semi-periphery’, distinguishing between upper and lower-order semi-periphery. It shows that compared to established members of the automotive semi-periphery, newcomers are often poorly equipped to thrive in the new competitive environment. Since it takes decades of organic accumulation to develop competitive assets that provide resilience, newcomers that used to thrive in the competitive environment of the integrated periphery often turn out to be the weakest members in the semi-periphery. Based on expert interviews, the article illustrates the theoretical arguments comparing the evolutionary trajectories of the Austrian and Hungarian automotive industries. We show that Austria, exemplifying the case of within-category upgrading (within the upper semi-periphery), can leverage its strong innovation potential, dense network of capable domestic-owned suppliers, tradition of cluster-based and industry–university collaboration, and developed market for technology. In contrast, the between-category transition of Hungary was propelled by the rising wage-level, while other indicators would not qualify it for the club of semi-periphery countries. Evolutionary trajectories in the lower-order semi-periphery can easily be derailed if industrial policy gets stuck in its–previously highly effective–integrated-periphery role.},

In all samples, satisfaction significantly influences students’ continuance usage intention with the online learning. In some samples, self-quarantine has a direct effect on continuance usage intention and plays a moderating role in Romania sample. The findings contribute to the universities and instructors how online systems factors elevate students’ continuance usage intention. The uniqueness of this study is the integration of three theories to obtain research objectives. The details of the results and both theoretical and practical implications have been described in the paper.},

However, AI adoption remains limited among Canadian firms. This research aims to identify the key dimensions of AI-driven digital transformation (AIDT) and develop a grounded theory that provides a rich and nuanced understanding of how the AIDT process unfolds within Canadian SMEs. The study reveals that the AIDT process is shaped by the interplay of five core dimensions: evaluating transformation context, auditing organisational readiness, piloting the AI integration, scaling the implementation, and leading the transformation. The first four dimensions follow a sequential, stage-like progression, while the fifth dimension is recurring and omnipresent, exerting a continuous impact on the other phases. AIDT is characterised as a path-dependent, slow evolutionary change spectrum that demands firms adapt by developing their sensing, seizing and reconfiguration capacities to evolve and sustain their evolutionary fitness. The study explores several theoretical and managerial implications that arise from the findings.},

Content analysis is employed to identify and assess the framing of AI, robotics and related themes in the documentation. Findings indicate only one subject mentions AI to position subject content and none mention robotics. An analysis of the framing of related themes, such as digital technology, data, and information ethics, is discussed. Findings also indicate multiple areas for the inclusion of these topics within the five categories of the ALIA foundation knowledge, while allowing for differentiation among programmatic and institutional foci. This paper argues that a form of integration of these topics in LIS professional education will be necessary in order to meet future skills needs.

   abstract = {Scheduling is a complex task due to the need to optimise multiple competing objectives and react to unpredictable events that may occur during production execution. The strategy of predictive-reactive scheduling can be used to reconcile the conflict between the original schedule and the current shop floor situation. This study seeks to present an inventory data-driven predictive-reactive production scheduling model that supports the evolving concepts of the Industry 4.0. Periodically, a machine learning technique provides predictive scheduling considering a best-case scenario according to an established Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Then, material non-availability causes disruptions in production, which triggers the Simulation-Based Optimization (SBO) method to handle these events. Thus, SBO provides a reactive schedule with the best set of priority rules to sequence jobs on each machine according to the data on the shop floor. This model was validated with a real case study using data collected from a metal-mechanical company. Considering the service level KPI, the results showed that the model is able to find a better solution in the compared scenarios. Therefore, even in a dynamic and stochastic scenario, with machine breakdowns, quality problems, raw material delays, and accuracy issues, the model proved efficient in mitigating these variations’ effects.},

A toolbox was also developed to support the use of the framework. It outlines a comprehensive landscape of popular and emerging digital tools in digitalizing urban services. Essentially, the K-A framework provides a ‘how-to’ in terms of identifying potential tools, while the digital toolbox shows ‘what-are-the-options’ for the users of the framework.

By reviewing early work of network theorists and Internet scholars as well as literature on the governance of the commons, this paper argues that beyond market, states, and their hybrids and beyond private property and public sector regimes, there exists political space for social practices and transformative legal interventions that can give shape to radically different institutional actions for the management of the world’s infocomputational resources. Programmable commons and the public value of programmability are thus introduced as parts of a broader political project that aspires to democratise access to, and management of these resources. By drawing on the history of a family of commons–namely intellectual commons, infrastructure commons, and global commons–this paper explores the material form and impact of infocomputational technologies and presents a blend of bottom-up and top-down initiatives for their commons-based organisation.},

   abstract = {In an era of increasing global challenges, two paradigmatic shifts–the digital and green transitions–have gained traction due to their potential impacts on industrial ecosystems and societal inequalities. Termed the ‘twin transition’, these shifts underscore the synergies between technological advancements and environmental sustainability. Highlighting its importance in post-COVID-19 recovery, the special issue examines the twin transition’s potential to drive industrial innovation and affect social, economic, and geographical inequalities. The seven articles in this special issue explore the impact of the twin transition on corporate innovation strategies and investment, alongside the economic, social, and geographical implications. Key findings underscore the need for diversified technological investments, especially in AI, and enhanced digital infrastructures. Policy recommendations advocate for aiding firms lagging in digitalisation and developing region-specific innovation policies. The research sets a roadmap for future inquiries into the interplay of digital and green transition, broader economic impacts, and policy-driven strategies.},

To keep their competitiveness, companies search continually to improve their efficiency, flexibility, and performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), new technologies are developed to increase connectivity and automate processes. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is known for its capacity to solve complex problems using statistical methods. I4.0 affects almost everything including LSS. Thus, a new combination is emerging LSS4.0 aiming at further increasing the operational excellence for companies. Therefore, the aim of this paper, as the first scoping review in this field, is to present the results of existing studies on the LSS and I4.0 integration, find the gaps in the literature, and provide directions for future studies. The paper proposes a framework that categorises the findings into three main discussed directions, which are relationship, implementation, and impact on performance.},

Tourism and cognate courses offered by higher educational institutions are essentially a part of the tourism system. This study aims to emphasize the perspective of tourism educators with respect to upcoming challenges in the tourism discipline and ways to reinvent and reboot the tourism education in the post-COVID-19 phase. The study adopted a qualitative approach and a total of 22 responses were interpreted. A thematic analysis using the Nvivo 12 plus software was done. Even though there was variability in the respondents’ background, a significant emphasis on curriculum design, industry collaboration, and excellence in research was mutually suggested by the educators. The study suggests that ambidextrous management in tourism education be adopted in post-COVID-19 phase. In other words, educators must become adept at the delivery of courses in a variety of modalities that would enable them to cope with the short and medium-term impacts of teaching in a COVID-19 (incremental innovation), while providing by anticipation of future demands (from industry and students), cutting edge curriculum (radical innovation).},

   abstract = {While multiple mechanisms for value creation from big data analytics (BDA) exist, their application in everyday life can create trade-offs, particularly in the context of service robotics where the dispersion of autonomous digital technologies creates potentials for data-driven efficiency gains. Attending to personal preferences in such contexts, increasingly vital for customer acceptance, may run counter to efficiency, thus constraining value creation and rendering efficiency-personalization trade-offs a key managerial challenge. For the case of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we formalize this trade-off and design a machine-learning approach to handle it by drawing on a unique dataset comprising 35,000 drives by 1,850 users. We consider the real-time dynamics and user interactions that affect the decisions of AVs and develop a model extension that allows for leveraging the properties of sharing business models to make better-informed decisions. Our study contributes to information systems (IS) AV research by providing an artifact that targets both efficiency and personalization of AV operations as well as the dynamic balance between the two. With the focus on everyday life contexts, our study points to the value of incorporating trade-offs between competing goals as well as human-centered perspectives in information systems designs for research on BDA value creation. For practitioners, our work provides a practical and generalizable approach to realize the potentials of service robots without risking customer acceptance.},

The governance of the digital transition, fully inserted in globalised capitalism, are not being able to reduce polarisation, economic inequalities, or the worsening environment. The article argues that failure in economic policy is closely linked to failure in political economy. The prevailing neoclassical approach is not being able to comprehensively explain the foundations, behaviour and results of digital economic life. To overcome this limitation, the article proposes a new narrative, the emergence of a new explanatory figure of economic behaviour and exchange. Homo digitalis extends the egotistical, isolated, and rational precepts of Homo economicus, and incorporates the scope of social welfare and environmental sustainability as enabling goals. The main components of Homo digitalis are the emergence of multiple biological, social and virtual identities and worlds; the integration of new forms of artificial and intelligent life into our bodies and minds (transhumanism); and the consolidation of a new egalitarian rule based on the access-platform-collaboration identity.},

The pace at which digital information and communication applications have been developed in recent years challenge healthcare managers to choose assertively those with the largest potential impacts on their operations. In this paper, we propose using value stream mapping, a technique from the lean healthcare (LH) toolbox, to guide the choice of H4.0 digital applications that are more likely to support the improvement of value flows in healthcare organisations. We propose a three-step method, starting with mapping current and future value streams of the process under analysis, gathering data from team members on the indicated kaizen bursts and H4.0 digital applications, and finally assessing and ranking H4.0 digital applications that best support improvements and comply with attributes that characterise successful technological innovations. Our propositions are illustrated through a case study conducted in the sterilisation unit of a large public university hospital. Our findings indicate that three H4.0 digital applications should be prioritised to support the improvement of the value stream under analysis. Our method combines the simplicity of LH with more sophisticated solutions brought by H4.0.},

We also collected data on the adoption levels of I4.0 design principles, whose analysis was conducted through the utilization of multivariate data analysis techniques. Our results indicated that, depending on the I4.0 design principle, OC profiles (Clan, Adhocracy, Market and Hierarchy) may either corroborate or impair its adoption, allowing the verification of the hypothesized relationships. The understanding of the association between OC profiles and I4.0 design principles provides practitioners with arguments to identify possible problems during their digital transformation. As changes in OC require significant efforts and are usually time-consuming, companies that can anticipate those issues might face a smoother transition towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution, hence, obtaining competitive advantages.},

Summary: Entrepreneurship education, the process of knowledge, skill, competency, and attitude development, aims to maximize the effectiveness of the entrepreneurial capacity building. The pandemic boosted the digital transformation of higher education and brought the online incubation platform NETMIB (Network of multidisciplinary ideation and business model generation) to life.

The framework supports the ongoing debate over valuable solutions in KM by focusing on process, system, mechanisms and technologies, and infrastructure as key variables mirrored in value propositions. A value-based perspective on KM expanded the extant literature because actors are connected in a complex setting hosting mutual value creation, in which interactions and institutions enlarge the context in which value is created and experienced. The framework represents guidelines for describing how knowledge shapes the value co-creation process.

Among those changes is replacing legacy information systems (LIS) with updated systems that integrate data, platforms, and software across all operational functions. The development of a broad legacy replacement system requires extensive resourses and a core development team composed of technical professionals with development oversight and operational experts representing the diverse interests of the functional units. Within the team, replacing LIS raises task conflicts in the distribution of system resources across operational departments and perception differences in the replacement system’s alignment with the organization’s needs. Prior studies suggest deploying collaborative strategies to resolve task-related conflicts on resource allocation and design preferences without contextual consideration. We built a model rooted in conflict survival theory to consider conflicts arising in the design of the replacement system, identify appropriate design team mechanisms, and examine conflict resolution strategies targeted to the context. A mixed-methods study of survey results from 119 legacy replacements and interviews of legacy replacement project managers indicates that teams adapt responses to the different conflict types inherent to legacy replacement design and should further consider selecting a conflict resolution strategy. Identifying appropriate actions and distinct conflict resolution strategies adds to task conflict theory and advises practice selecting the more appropriate activities and strategies specific to replacement system design.},

Therefore, many companies have adopted digitalization to address the rapidly changing environment. However, few studies have explored the mediating mechanism between digitalization and collaborative planning. Based on structural equation modeling, this study examines how digital transformation can improve collaborative planning through the mediating roles of management participation and information sharing. The results indicate that digital transformation significantly affects management and information sharing. Additionally, management participation and information sharing positively affect collaborative planning. However, this study reveals that digital transformation does not directly influence collaborative planning. Overall, owing to a lack of research exploring the mediating mechanism between digital transformation and collaborative planning, this study contributes to digitalization and manufacturing and provides valuable suggestions. Fundamentally, companies that want to develop digitalization and encourage collaborative planning should consider the effects of management participation and information sharing.},

The concept of Industry 3.5 is relatively new and mainly involves creating a transition from Industry 3.0 to 4.0. In particular, this study analyses the several causal indicators of Industry 3.5 on manufacturer performance using covariance-based structural equation modelling. The manufacturer performance is evaluated from the extent of opportunities obtained by businesses, which is investigated using three indicators: digital decision-making, digital transformation, and total resource management. The results indicate that these are the key driving factors that determine the manufacturing performance in Industry 3.5.},

By combining the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with the triple bottom line, this research aims to examine the impacts and acceptance of fifth-generation technology. We analyzed 695 data sets collected from Taiwanese manufacturing and healthcare organisations using structural equation modelling, a new factor-based analysis. We elucidate user attitudes and beliefs, and measure the possible impacts on both the perceived usefulness of and subjective norms regarding the acceptance and use of fifth-generation technology. The major contribution is to understand the users’ acceptance of new technology. The results showed that the participants’ perceptions and consciousness regarding fifth-generation technology affected sustainability in both manufacturing and healthcare organisations.

Circular supply chain management optimises resource utilisation and minimises waste in achieving competitive advantage; however, prior studies failed to build enablers for industrial improvement under qualitative information. This study adopts the fuzzy Delphi method to arrive at a valid group of attributes. Fuzzy set theory deals with the uncertainties from qualitative data, and fuzzy interpretive structural modelling builds the hierarchical structure under uncertainties. The best-worst method confirms the consistencies. This study stipulates a four-level hierarchical structure in the seafood processing industry. The results show that organisational capability and agility, technological advancement and economic benefit are dominant aspects. Commitment of leadership and managerial support, suppliers’ collaboration, firm culture, readiness for organisational change and sustainability concept integration are top criteria for industrial improvement.},

This paper draws on a systematic literature review of recent research published by accounting professional bodies outlining the impact of digital technologies on the accounting profession. By taking advantage of this work this study critically assesses the types of skills and personal qualities that graduates as future accountants will need and explores the implications for accounting education and university curricula. The analysis reveals that necessary skills for future accountants may be summarised into four categories: (a) Ethical skills; (b) Digital skills; (c) Business skills; and (d) Soft skills. The analysis reveals ‘adaptability’ and ‘lifelong approach to CPD’ as the two essential personal qualities for future accountants. The practical implications for university accounting education are summarised in a proposed conceptual framework. The proposed conceptual framework: (1) acts as a roadmap for universities to align their accounting curricula with the developments in professional body syllabi; (2) helps university accounting education teachers to update, enrich, and refocus their teaching and learning approach to the requirements of the 4IR; and (3) promotes the coordination and rationalisation of the skills and personal qualities currently pursued by employability agendas at university, course, and module levels.},

In the context of this project the current state, future goals and barriers in between have been researched through literature studies, surveys, and interviews. Several similar studies have been done in the past; however, the barriers are still there. The paper, therefore, introduces a novel framework to study technology transfer. It identifies three key vectors of transfer: standards and regulation, software, and people. Along these vectors, it identifies elements that pull and elements that push technology, but which need to overcome the various frictions and barriers. These are then structured according to the PESTEL approach. This approach encourages the holistic study of factors beyond technology. The paper concludes that there is a need for a better way of deployment, organizing, marketing, and learning about new technologies which would mostly benefit small and medium enterprises which lag most in the use of ICT. This could be implemented in the form of industrial digital platforms as a part of the Industry 4.0 strategy.},

The experimental group used the proposed method during the semester, the control group did not. Before and after the semester, the following tests were conducted: diagnostics of leadership abilities (Zharikov and Krushelnitsky), Eysenck’s self-assessment of mental states, and methods for identifying communicative and organizational abilities (COA-1). The obtained results were compared using the Student’s t-test to identify significant differences. In all tests, the experimental group showed statistically significant improvement in all indicators. Similarly, significant statistical differences were also found between the results of pre- and post-test, which allows one to assert that the proposed method contributes to leadership qualities development and reduction of negative emotions in students. Thus, the experimental group scored an average of 26.71 (out of possible 50 points) on the pre-test and 37.01 on the post-test, demonstrating a significant increase in the level of leadership qualities from weakly expressed to strongly expressed. According to the post-test results, the difference between the groups becomes statistically significant for both communicative and organizational tendencies (p = 0.023 and p = 0.027, respectively). In practice, the study results can be used to implement leadership development programs in universities.},

While traditional IT governance approaches have lent themselves well to extracting value from a long-lasting competitive advantage, they can become a liability if agile companies need to continuously reinvent themselves in pursuit of a new, “transient” competitive advantage. To that end, a temporal dimension of IT governance (when and how fast to decide) becomes as important as its structural (who decides what) and procedural (how to decide) aspects. In this paper, we adopt a “ternary” view on governance and build on the extant literature in IS, strategy, and organisation design as well as exemplar case studies to explore how traditional approaches to IT governance structures, processes, and relational mechanisms are altered to improve sensing, deciding, and responding capabilities in turbulent business environments. These mechanisms are then summarised into four digital governance principles to guide future research and practice. Those principles are: 1) disciplined autonomy, 2) IS-Business convergence, 3) permeable boundaries, and 4) incremental financial commitment including fast experimentation.},

Our data reveal a sequence of different kinds of social interactions over the course of a change process, from collective-focused interactions (i.e., kindness and sharing) in stable contracts to transactional interactions (i.e., “what is in it for me”) following psychological contract disruption, to relational interactions (i.e., vigilance about equity in social exchange) in psychological contract repair, and to a final return to resonance and alignment with others and a return to psychological contract maintenance. Our results suggest that social interactions play a more potent role in the dynamics of psychological contracting than is currently recognized in the literature. Finally, we discuss a number of implications for dynamic models of psychological contracting.},

Although SMEs are flexible in operation, they bear disadvantages such as accessing financial resources, recruiting talents, and limited managerial capacities. Digitalisation is, therefore, more challenging for these companies. Following an open-end approach for theory development, the paper generalises empirical evidence of a medium-sized manufacturer to a conceptual model and an implementation pathway to fast-track digital transformation. The company successfully adopted multiple SCQM systems and Industry 3.5 in a relatively short period. Knowledge management is the key to optimise knowledge flow and facilitate digital transformation. The paper contributes to the supply chain management literature by proposing an SCQM and Industry 3.5 integration model and proposes a pathway for such integration in developing markets. This approach has been proved to be an efficient way to fast-track integration and provide significant organisational benefits to the companies.},

For example, the global pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation and encouraged more online learning and working. Furthermore, reducing the speed of climate change is one of the major issues of our time. To be able to deal with major changes in our environment, employers, employees, and students (future employees) need to readjust how they evaluate their business, organizational activities, and education. Business schools have the responsibility to prepare the students with skills and values to engage in this rapidly changing environment. This means a change from the traditional profit maximization approach only to, among others, the development of global competencies and a global mindset. The development of a comprehensive framework for Global Citizenship in business education will therefore help organizations and educators alike. Based on an extensive literature review and an empirical study through focus groups and in-depth interviews of the professional field and educators a model of Global Citizenship for business education and practitioners is presented. The model of global citizenship consists of components encouraging the development of global competencies and attributes. These competencies and attributes are needed for (international) professionals to act as responsible global citizens.},

This study is one of the first to test the effect of three moderators, business culture renewal, organisational structure, and strategic renewal, on the relationship between BMI through digital transformation and business performance. An empirical study was conducted on 198 South African and 226 Dutch SMEs to achieve this. The Exploratory factor analysis, regression analysis, and correlation analysis findings confirm that BMI through digital transformation positively impacts SMEs’ overall business performance. Moreover, the findings show that when SMEs increase their BMI through digital transformation, business performance will increase if (1) the business successfully implements a flexible organisational structure and (2) renews its strategy. The findings indicate that business culture renewal does not have this same effect. Also, the multivariate analysis of variance shows no significant differences between the business performance of SMEs from the two countries. Managerial implications relate to identifying how SMEs can achieve BMI innovation through digital transformation, which is still lacking. Furthermore, SMEs should adapt their existing organisational structure and strategy to accommodate digital transformation changes.},

As a result, it was possible to realize that the wide worldwide portfolio of contributions in the literature can be grouped in seven main clusters, which, in turn, are further synthesized through a proposed framework including three main blocks about models, tools, and business approaches about collaborative manufacturing and management in I4.0. It was also possible to recognize that learning, and further, co-learning are key issues correlating collaboration with I4.0, along with the human factor, which assumes a central role in linking these two domains, which combined, are of utmost importance to enable companies to reach a sustainable development in the current digitalization era. Future open research questions should be explored in order to further analyse industrial understandings on the importance of the underlying communication, learning, and collaboration approaches, along with supporting methods, means, and tools, to properly approach collaboration issues in I4.0, for promoting sustainable development of companies.},

   abstract = {The digital transformation of traditional broadcasting is of particular interest to media scholars worldwide. In Russia, terrestrial broadcasting that has in recent decades dominated the national media system with large audiences and attracting the major advertisers has been affected by digitalization of the national media industry, the rapid growth of the internet and the shift of young audiences to social media. This has resulted in new tensions and growing uncertainties in the Russian broadcast market forcing broadcasters to reshape traditional strategies under pressures of digitalization. The study analyses visions of online strategies for Russian broadcasting companies in the context of ongoing industrial changes. Based on the data from semi-structured interviews with senior managers of the leading Russian broadcasting companies, who discussed the digital practices of their companies. The authors argue that Russia’s audiovisual media companies are currently going through the initial stage of digital transformation. The transformation process has slowed, because media managers have to make decisions under extremely high market uncertainty resulting from changes in the advertising market and in media regulation. Also, broadcasters continue to view the state as an important source of financial support, especially during the digital switchover in 2009–2019. The high level of the state control in the Russian media business has resulted in the high market concentration rate and deceleration of the technological development thus threatening traditional business model, especially in the television market. Yet, digital products created and disseminated by Russian broadcasters on the digital platforms are still perceived by television managers as supplements to traditional broadcasting. The same is true of the internal working processes in broadcasting companies in which digital departments often remain small and are not fully integrated in the corporate managerial system. Moreover direct financial effects of the digitalization are estimated as low. But many broadcast managers consider digitalization and creation of new business models are inevitable, though companies have still not elaborated holistic online strategies and continue to develop online activities under their own momentum.},

A stylized narrative is that a few regions dominate the making of these technologies and enjoy a virtuous cycle of increasing employment, innovativeness, and in-migration of the creative class. Regions merely applying these technologies may get into a vicious cycle of increasing unemployment, out-migration, and decreasing innovativeness. Following the normative governance turn in regional political economics, this theoretical policy paper pitches a framework of three complementary institutions to direct the technology-driven structural change for regional catching-up. Firstly, a system for innovation and entrepreneurial activity creates jobs by supporting exploitation of complementarities of application, co-development activities, and product innovation within mature and emerging sectors. Secondly, education provides creative and entrepreneurial skills to exploit technological opportunities and upskills workers for emerging sectors. Thirdly, labour market and social security institutions are to allow rationalization in mature sectors, incentivize hiring and learning on the job, as well as encourage innovative ventures, notably in emerging sectors. Challenges of implementation of the framework due to path-dependence, co-evolution, and multi-scalarity as well as applicability in different varieties of capitalism are examined.},

This requires sufficiently long data series, but the necessary input data are often lacking in the case of complex control strategies. This article compares a new method to extrapolate yearly CSO volume reduction by simulating a limited number of CSO events. The method showed a good accuracy (2–3% deviation) when applied to a synthetic example. When applied to a real case study in Copenhagen (Denmark), the method showed a tendency to overestimate the performance of the control. The results underline how performance of real time control strategies is strongly affected by yearly variation, non-linearity and interactions among the elements of the system. It is thus suggested to use a mix of different performance indicators when evaluating control performance in conditions of data scarcity.},

The aim of the paper is thus to explore the practical implications and impact of RPA in the procurement function in order to improve our conceptual understanding of this recently introduced practice. As first movers, seven case studies from various industries were selected based on their significant successes and experiences in the field of digitalisation in the procurement sector. The findings confirm the relevance of some recognised attributes of procurement automation, while other attributes have also been explored. The study suggests that RPA impacts on procurement in operational, organisational and relational terms. Furthermore, we identify the motives and challenges when implementing this type of initiative in the field of procurement.},

The plans are determined through a two-level MILP model and are iteratively evaluated by a detailed discrete-event simulation model to guarantee capacity-feasible solutions at the scheduling level. Through an industrial case study of a multistage assembly line design collaboratively operated by humans and mobile shared robots, near-optimal solutions comprise lot-sizing decisions, the release schedule of production orders, the allocation of tasks to humans or robots, and the number of robots per period. Moreover, by addressing a set of propositions to assess the methodology, the results highlight the advantages of the hybrid approach to converge into optimised operational decisions and analyse the process dynamics.},

The Lean Six Sigma approach is re-evaluated and possibly upgraded to enhance its suitability with Industry 4.0 technologies to provide maximum benefits for any organisation. However, the integration of Industry 4.0 within the lean six sigma framework is associated with various challenges like privacy issues and the non-availability of skilled labours which was not studied extensively in the existing literature. Hence, this study identifies the challenges in adopting the Industry 4.0 technologies within the lean six sigma framework and provides a detailed overview of their interrelationships and hierarchy. A Delphi-assisted total interpretive structural modelling was designed for this study in which the Delphi method was utilised to identify the challenges and the total interpretive structural modelling method was employed to process the challenges and decide the contextual interrelationships. The categorisation of the challenges was done by the application of cross-impact matrix multiplication to the classification. This study indicates the necessity for information technology infrastructure development specifically catering to data security and its important role in enhancing the intellectual capacity of an organisation through the development of its personnel. The finding of the study and the roadmap developed will help the practitioners and managers towards successful adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies within the lean six sigma framework for their operation excellence, and enhance the performance of the business and organisational efficiency.},

This study employs structural equation modeling to rigorously test the proposed hypotheses, drawing upon a researcher-designed survey administered to 382 MSMEs. The findings provide valuable insights into the barriers that hinder digitalization adoption in developing countries, emphasizing the crucial roles of government support, knowledge creation and absorption, and competitive intensity. Moreover, the study uncovers the positive impact of firm engagement in digitalization on post-digitalization performance.

After the 2008 financial crisis the remit of a bank Treasury has expanded in terms of scope and strategic significance, evolving from a transactional cash manager to a balance sheet custodian.

Adoption of digital technologies and related innovation that underpins the Fourth Industrial Revolution can address many of the traditional Treasury challenges and deliver a wide range of benefits. The adoption of digital technology in bank Treasuries tend to be lower than in other business areas within a bank.

There is thus a need for researching a Treasury specific approach that can provide guidance on developing a digital implementation strategy and enable the transition towards a next generation ‘smart’ digital Treasury department.

   abstract = {A methodology is proposed for systematic map assessment to contribute to landscape-change research. Two major topic areas are dealt with, namely: content, quality and usefulness of landscape information on different maps; and methods used in the spatial conversion of maps into digital systems (e.g. geographical information systems). The major focus is on information about physical landscape characteristics (e.g. land cover) and land uses. The approach was tested using a sequence of nine large- and medium-scale basic maps of the island of Ruissalo in SW Finland from between 1690 and 1998. Fundamental differences were found in the thematic consistency of landscape information, mainly related to the scale, purpose and generalization of landscape information on different maps. Spatial matching was tested for a set of three old maps using four image rectification functions. The results showed that spatial matching of old maps is difficult, and success in rectification is influenced by many factors. Evaluation and selective transformation of landscape information from maps and the use of supportive information from other sources can assist in landscape-change analysis based on map sequences.},

   abstract = {The emergence of Industry 4.0 has brought in its wake an important number of challenges and opportunities for organisations across the globe. To cope with such a fast-changing environment, organisations have been steadily implementing different types of technologies, and at different stages. One of the most disruptive and promising technology is blockchain, and its potential to transform various aspects of organisations’ business and operations, including the supply chain relationships, is tremendous. In line with the global research trend in this domain, this paper proposes a multi-stage model of adoption (intention, adoption, and routinisation stages), for a better understanding of blockchain diffusion across supply chains. We drew on the diffusion of innovations theory, the resource-based view, dynamic capability, the technology adoption model, and the institutional theory to propose a multi-stage model. We validated the model using PLS-SEM, which was applied on data collected in India and the U.S. Our results showed that, from one country to another, there are essential differences in the variables that determine blockchain innovation and in the stage of diffusion. Additionally, our proposed model provided a good explanation at all stages of blockchain diffusion. This study offers significant and valuable contributions in terms of theory and management.},

The mediating role of supply chain internal and external collaboration is evaluated based on data collected through a survey of Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that firms’ DO has a positive effect on a firm’s economic and environmental performance, and that this relationship is mediated by both internal and external collaboration. This study provides an in-depth understanding on how DO strategy affects firms’ performance through supply chain collaboration as a structure, from an SSP perspective. Finally, it proposes corresponding managerial suggestions for practitioners to improve performance.},

While much is known about such relationships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), they remain taken for granted and under researched in the creative industries. We argue that they are pivotal for different domains of research and policy, notably, cultural policy, higher education, innovation systems, and regional development. To that end, this paper aims to open up consideration of these relationships which we argue 1) stimulate innovation and 2) make broader contributions to local communities and economic regeneration via a creative economy approach. Using the Triple Helix framework, we explore university-industry-governemnt relationships and knowledge exchange mechanisms via a comparative analysis of two creative industries case cities: Shenzhen, China and Brisbane, Australia. Although different in some important respects the two cities have both adopted creative industries policy frameworks. We found important differences between the cases in the roles and relative strength of the three sectoral actors. This study also shows a need for strategic incentives to foster collective capacity and governance interventions as a push to broker relationships that were not there before. Focussing on boundary spanning we also argue that cultural policy should have formal mechanisms and informal interactions to build a sustainable innovation ecosystem based on knowledge exchange.},

Our main findings were that "relevance" is the strongest driver of recall, satisfaction and behavioural change. Social interactions amongst learners and between faculty and learners are possible in the digital world, and we observed a trend of the young learners in favour of digital learning, especially with improved technical platforms enabling social interaction. Other findings were that new skills are required by the teaching faculty and that hybrid formats were identified by all participants as the model of the future.

   abstract = {Emerging careers in technology-focused fields such as data science coupled with necessary graduate outcomes mandate the need for a truly interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. However, the rapid pace of curriculum development in this field of inquiry has meant that curricula across universities has largely evolved in line with the internal disciplinary strengths of each institution rather than in response to the needs of graduates. To assist with the development of data science subjects the themes and content that contribute to each subject should be objectively validated. We propose the use of an objective test for data science curricula to quantify whether a particular degree programme maintains an interdisciplinary perspective unconstrained by single discipline bias. The test analyses a given curriculum and quantifies the subject components by category using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.},

   abstract = {Financial transactions are part of everyday life, yet banking has largely withstood the digital transformation within most European countries. Recently, there have been initiatives that merge the digital and the financial sphere by integrating the transactions that run through established financial infrastructures into digital platforms. Large data-driven companies hereby seek access to financial transactions and try to embed payments within their platforms. This contribution discusses differing models of how tech-driven companies gain access to financial infrastructures, and how recently introduced policies engender these processes. Within Europe and the United Kingdom, banks that operate through financial infrastructures and hold most transactional data are now required by regulators to provide access to their customers’ accounts. The platformization of financial transactions is thus not purely a technical question, but it also is a remarkable example of how politically enforced changes in the materiality of data lead to reconfigurations with broader economic and social consequences. It results in the transformation of money into a form of (transactional) data and shows how the value of money and data depends on the technological underpinnings that determine the capability of their circulation. In order to understand their valuation, we need to take the material assemblages that enable their distribution into account.},

Construction markets have changed with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Turkish construction enterprises securing more projects overseas. Understanding and exploiting the competitive advantage possessed by enterprises from major advanced economies is being challenged by enterprises from newly industrialised economies. This study investigates the competitiveness factors of the Korean construction (KOC) enterprises to understand how they have been successful in exploiting their competitive advantages. The competitiveness evaluation model (CEM) is developed using system dynamics which compares the project performances between the models generated by general and Korea-featured competitiveness factors in winning work in the ICM. The findings reveal that ownership of the enterprise, government strategy and support for the construction industry enterprises, strong leadership, technology-intensive, and special characteristics of large Korean enterprises (Chaebol system) could be critical factors for creating competitive advantage.},

In 2017, Policy Lab in the UK Cabinet Office advertised the first UK job for a “Policy Designer” requesting skills, such as visualizing complex data, creating and testing prototypes in policy delivery environments, and facilitating workshops with people of all backgrounds. Since then, many UK central government departments have followed suit and by 2022, around 50 Policy Designers work in various government departments. According to Nesta, there are more than 200 government labs around the world and ∼60 in Europe. Around ten of these are concentrated in UK central government and the first UK policy labs opened their doors in 2014 in the Cabinet Office and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance. However, the design for policy agenda is also on the rise in Eastern Europe; and Latvia has been identified as an example of good practice by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In 2018, the Latvian Innovation Laboratory was opened in the State Chancellery and now in 2022, it embarks on its third distinct phase of operation. This article charts the rise of government labs in the UK and Latvia to explore different experiences and identify good practices in building capability for policy design across Europe. The purpose of this research is not to make a comparison between the two countries, as they are on very different stages of their journeys, but to identify strengths and weaknesses in the supply and demand for policy design to drawn out lesson learned for other European countries. What has been the role of policy labs in the rise of the policy designer in the UK and Latvia? To what extent is there a professional community of policy designers in either country? Bobrow outlines seven preconditions for a professional community: self-identification as a policy designer, a professional association, journals, standards for certification, broader attribution of special expertise, a core foundation of knowledge, and capacity building programmes. This article explores the emergence of policy labs and policy designers in the UK and Latvia, the attributes, skillset, challenges, opportunities, and whether according to Bobrow’s criteria policy design is a professional community.},

The coherence of Japan’s postwar productionist model began to fray in the 1980s, and was lost at both macro and micro levels in the 1990s, contributing to secular stagnation. The paper steers a nuanced path between the view that this stemmed from Japan doggedly maintaining its postwar model, and conversely, from abandoning it. Since the mid 2010s, Japan has embarked on digital and green transformations under the banners of Society 5.0, DX, ESG/SDGs, green growth and sustainable capitalism. These are bringing about institutional and ideational change, but if a new coherence is to be attained, an internal contradiction must be acknowledged and addressed.},

The growing body of research addressing the issue of imbalances in DEEs has raised the challenge of how to recommend policies specifically designed to overcome the causes of such imbalances. This paper explores the issue of platformization in three developed and high-income countries in the European Union: Germany, France and Austria. The framework and empirical measurement of the Digital Platform Economy (DPE) Index are used to analyze the state of DEE in these three countries, identify the most prominent weaknesses that could be barriers, and propose policy recommendations to overcome these barriers and promote the development of DEE. The results of the three-step investigation present the current state of DEE in each country and find that similar constraining elements in the Digital Multi-Sided Platforms of the three countries have the most potential to systemically disrupt the DEE balance. Tailor-made policies with a holistic approach are recommended to address these constraining elements and target overall DEE growth. The results of this study are expected to motivate future research highlighting the issues surrounding multi-sided platform markets in the context of digital economic development in the European Union.},

However, newer academic literature focuses on explaining why public support for local media has become a necessity from a market failure and societal point of view. Almost no attention is dedicated to the question which known public support instruments might be considered as helpful from the perspective of local media and their digital transformation strategies. Therefore, this study draws on strategic path dependence theory and investigates how local media’s perceptions of innovation constraints (i.e., lock-in mechanisms), their innovation status (i.e., lock-ins) and their preferences for public support instruments to enable innovation (i.e., public un-lock mechanisms) differ depending on the type of strategy. Four strategies are compared: two content strategies (multimedia formats and artificial intelligence applications) as well as two commercial strategies (revenue diversification and digital payment models). Data about the four strategies are collected with an online survey of local media, which operate in the Swiss Canton of St. Gallen. The findings show significant differences between the investigated strategies and suggest a differentiated approach to public support of local media in the digital age.},

It was found that campus design, physical environment, and facilities may influence students’ choice of institution, but these have less weight than other factors such as the university’s reputation and teaching quality. Most students believe that opportunities for higher quality teaching and learning exist at the new campus, as all participants reported that the new teaching rooms have improved layouts and incorporated more technology. Also, most students perceive their overall student experience at the new campus as good or excellent, and every participant rated their overall satisfaction as the same or higher at the new campus compared to the old campus. No student was less satisfied with the new campus. The research findings suggest that institutions and students may both derive considerable benefits from a new purpose-built campus that has been well-designed and constructed.},

These forms of digital capitalism have begun to infuse the higher education landscape by merging with existing political demands for universities to become more data-driven, competitive, and market-focused. This article presents a case study of the education business Pearson and its expansion of the digital platform as a model for global higher education reform. A key ‘edu-business’ in the ‘global education industry’, Pearson has pivoted to online program management platforms, on-demand digital learning platforms, and intensive mobilization of data analytics to enact its strategic business priorities. These developments position Pearson as an authoritative source for both the evaluation and valuation of HE as a market. The analysis foregrounds the micro-processes involved as Pearson has sought to make, exploit, and maintain market opportunities in HE, demonstrating how the market form of digital capitalism is being reproduced by commercial power-players in the global higher education industry. As an actor in the sociotechnical arrangement of markets, the digital platform is a key participant in HE reforms that are intended to align the public mission of universities with the private interests of digital capitalism.},

In this article, we examine how edtech investors imagine and invest in the future of higher education through an empirical case study of a UK investing company. Utilising concepts and methods from economic sociology, we analyse how investment companies engage in techno-financial ‘futuring’ practices. We identify two kinds of futuring practices. First, investors’ imaginary practices produce qualitative ‘fictional expectations’ about the future of education, supported by quantitative financial valuation practices that predict the monetary returns on investment available from funding edtech. Second, we analyse the specific investment-supporting operations of edtech investors, highlighting how imagined futures of education are funded into existence (or not) as investors select and support edtech products or services. In these ways, imaginaries of the future may be materialised in educational institutions through financial investments in specific edtech products. We particularly trace how investment imaginaries and operations shift from edtech markets as selling commodities to edtech industry controlling digital products and resources as assets. Therefore, the two identified complementary futuring practices function as processes of ‘assetisation’, aimed at turning educational services and resources into digital assets with calculable future value for edtech investors.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify different types of technology-based retail services (TBRS) for brick and mortar environments and analyze them by developing a framework that can be used to classify TBRS in respect of their dimensions, categories and category elements. The research design is twofold. First, this study conducts a systematic literature review to identify a relevant body of various TBRS in scientific literature. Second, it uses grounded theory as a method to analyze the identified TBRS from part one, in order to expose TBRS classification dimensions for developing a classification framework. This study identified 35 TBRS from 124 peer-reviewed articles, published worldwide between 2003 and 2019. It shows that TBRS can be classified along four dimensions: (1) participant issues, (2) technology issues, (3) information issues, and (4) intended purposes. The findings indicate that the majority of TBRS has technology-generated customer contact and is a fixed in-store totem with a low task complexity. Most TBRS enhance customer experience or improve store management. This study addresses a significant and on-going change in retailing. It provides insights into the TBRS market and offers an analytical classification framework to take TBRS to pieces, showing their elements and purposes. The framework can both guide future research and aid retail practitioners in analyzing TBRS.},

Within higher education, there is a driving imperative to adapt to the new digital environment not only in areas involved in learning and teaching but also among research teams. While libraries play an important role in developing the digital literacy of researchers as individuals, little attention has been paid to the digital capability of the research team. A review of the literature was undertaken of digital transformation frameworks and models across business, government and higher education. No applicable models or frameworks were found to be suitable for a research team environment. A digital capability model was developed, drawing upon the critical elements discussed in the literature. This model enables library staff to assess the digital capability of the research team, allowing them to not only tailor their services to specific research teams but also driving changes to overall service offerings to better meet the needs of researchers across the organisation. Using this model changes the nature of library staff’s conversation with research team leaders.},

Building on a resource-based view, this work examines the impact of AI on SC risk management for SMEs. A structural model comprising of AI-risk management capabilities, SC re-engineering capabilities and supply chain agility (SCA) was developed and tested based on data collected from executives, managers and senior managers of SMEs The main methodological approach used in this study is partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The results identified the use of AI for risk management influences SC re-engineering capabilities and agility. Re-engineering capabilities further affect and mediate agility. PLS-SEM and ANN were compared and the results revealed consistency for models A and B. Current levels of demand uncertainties in the SC challenges managers in making complex trade-off decisions that require huge management resources in very limited time. With AI, it is possible to model various scenarios to answer crucial questions that archaic infrastructures are not able to. This study combines a multi-construct agility concept and identified non-linear relationships in the model.},

This model counters the logic of technological outsourcing upon which many assumptions and critiques of the smart city rest, and thus reveals ways in which a more generative discourse can be forged. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews with senior stakeholders from public and private sector organizations, we develop a case study of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Through coordinated efforts to reorganize the public sector’s technological functions, develop nation-wide skills upgrading programs, and repatriate overseas tech talent, the government strives to assemble an ideo-technical ecosystem of talent, skills, and civic-mindedness in Singapore. This is an ecosystem designed to establish the public sector as the driver of urban innovation, and thus maximize the benefits of “civic tech”.},

   abstract = {Industry 4.0 mainly focuses on the application of modern technologies (digitalization) and the changing role of human beings (digital transformation) in modern production and logistics systems. Besides the basic principles of digitalization, interconnectivity, and autonomization, the importance of human-centered decision-making processes, such as the selection of strategic suppliers, is also increasing, as complex, novel, and unstructured decisions cannot be fully computerized. In this context, there is still a lack of understanding of which formal patterns in the strategic supplier selection process will lead to better supplier performance. Until now, most of the literature emphasizes a minor number of process-related factors in the strategic supplier selection process leading to limited support for the individual decision-maker. This study introduces a cause-effect model that extends prior research by investigating the impact of process formality, as a comprehensive measurement construct of target-, information-, organization-, and heuristics-related process factors in the strategic supplier selection process on supplier performance and purchaser satisfaction. Based on the usage of variance-based structural equation modeling in a large-scale field study, a significant relationship between process formality and supplier performance as well as between process formality and purchaser satisfaction is substantiated.},

This paper explores similarities in their approaches to the public funding and planning of care robot development, commercialization, and implementation since the late 1990s, and what the differences reveal about their contrasting priorities in science, technology, and innovation policy, as well as differential treatment of care robotics as an industry and as a research domain. I conclude by arguing for the importance of studying such funding mechanisms and institutional actors to better understand their key role in shaping the emergent landscape of care robotics.},

Using multi-source data from a sample of 73 CEOs/entrepreneurs and 377 middle managers in China, we find that in DT: (1) ambidextrous learning is positively related to organisational performance; (2) entrepreneurial leadership has a positive impact on ambidextrous learning; (3) ambidextrous learning mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and organisational performance. Our results further reveal that change in operation strengthens the effect of ambidextrous learning on organisational performance while it has no significant impact on the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and ambidextrous learning. Finally, we discuss how our ﬁndings extend the studies of entrepreneurial leadership and ambidextrous learning and provide implications for DT practices.},

   abstract = {Background: Good interactions are essential in caring for people with dementia. There is a lack of knowledge about interaction approaches used by caregivers in person-centered dementia care. This study aimed to understand interactions in person-centered dementia care. Methods: A search for relevant publications was undertaken in 2020 on two electronic databases, MEDLINE with full text and CINAHL Plus with full text. This was supplemented by manual searching of the reference lists of relevant articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to determine the relevance of the articles. Data extraction included publication year, country, study setting, aim, design, definition of person-centered dementia care, elements of person-centered dementia care and interaction approaches used by caregivers. A Donabedian quality framework was used to group the elements of person-centered dementia care into three categories: structure, process and outcome. Results: A total of 25 articles were included in the review, all from developed countries. A conceptual framework was developed for the delivery of person-centered dementia care. It includes the organizational structure, ie, management and resources, a competent workforce and physical environment; the dementia care process, ie, respectful interaction underpinned by good knowledge about the care recipients in a calm, peaceful environment; and care outcome, ie, the social, psychological, and physical well-being of the care recipients. Interaction approaches used by caregivers in providing person-centered dementia care were classified according to the six purposes of interaction: to know and understand the care recipient, to keep the person happy and satisfied, to make the person feel safe and secure, to calm the person, to support self-identity, and to guide the person in conducting daily activities. Conclusion: The delivery of person-centered dementia care needs to consider organizational structure, the dementia care process, and care outcome which together foster a positive environment for meaningful interactions between caregivers and care recipients. The identified interaction approaches could be used by dementia care trainers to develop training materials.},

The study focuses on the central issues of the evolution of the digital transformation (DT) process. This paper proposes a theoretical framework of digital transformation in traditional manufacturing based on environment, people, organisation, and technology synergy. We chose a large textile company in China as a case to explore the process of DT practices in the traditional manufacturing industry. The results of the study showed that data accessibility has a positive impact on a strategic responsiveness during organisation’s DT, driven by data, information, knowledge and wisdom synergy. In the process of DT, the availability of information positively impacts the industry and the social well-being of an organisation. DT has a negative impact on individual willingness to share outlier knowledge and employee role perceptions. This study is both a complement to the deconstruction of the mechanism of DT in the manufacturing industry, and a new attempt to tap the laws of digital technology in the knowledge age.},

Developing a cost-based competitive advantage while ensuring a high-quality product is a critical problem in intelligent manufacturing. From the perspective of big data and reinforcement learning, the authors designed a reward value combining transaction, interaction, and measurement data by combining the reward mechanism and Markov decision for a combination of different raw materials in the intelligent textile factory. The authors propose a big data-driven application to the depth of the reinforcement learning to solve problems and build a big-data-driven matching model based on deep reinforcement learning to cotton matching. The offline strategy is designed to construct a memory bank and neural network, and the incentive mechanism of reinforcement learning is used to iterate the optimal yarn matching scheme to achieve the goal of intelligent cotton matching. The results show that deep reinforcement learning can be optimised using big data on the premise of quality assurance. Manufacturing costs can be optimised using a matching model of big data based on a deep reinforcement learning model.},

It then critiques the interplay between the two, concluding that despite being influenced by campus-based instructional delivery in its early days, distance education is now influencing campus-based education. Implications of convergence are also discussed. Arguably, distance education universities should be proud of the increasing presence of distance education in campus-based universities and have confidence in maintaining their advantages. As for campus-based universities, a systems approach is needed if they intend to take advantage of this ‘unorthodox’ mode of education. Finally, it is suggested that both campus-based education and distance education are at the center of higher education because they are now equally conventional.},

As a result, many enterprises strive to leverage digital technology to gain new processes, products, services, and business models, thereby enhancing their competitive edge. This paper mainly focuses on how digital innovation based on different value-creation methods can help enterprises build their core competence. Using a sample of 254 questionnaires from manufacturing enterprises in China, this study investigates whether and how efficiency-based, convergence-based, and generativity-based digital innovation supports the development of core competence using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Further, this paper examines the moderating effect of absorptive capacity. The empirical results indicate that digital innovation encourages the establishment of core competence, and absorptive capacity strengthens the role of efficiency-based digital innovation but inhibits convergence-based and generativity-based digital innovation.

The implementation of carbon emission reduction will inevitably have an impact on industrial development. Three different carbon emission scenarios were established. Based on the average annual carbon emission growth rate of the past decade, it is set as a medium carbon scenario. According to the economic development stage and actual social development situation of each region, the corresponding annual average carbon emission growth rate is increased and decreased to set up high carbon and low carbon scenarios. The adjacent accumulation gray multivariate model for industries is established based on different scenarios. The results indicate that the carbon emission scenarios most suitable for industrial development in various regions are different. Heavy industrial provinces and cities such as Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei have the highest industrial output value under high carbon scenarios; Provinces and cities with high levels of industrialization, such as Jiangsu, Shanghai, Guangdong and Chongqing have the highest industrial output value under low-carbon scenarios. The industrial output value of Hebei is expected to grow the fastest under the high carbon scenario, reaching 2.15 trillion yuan by 2030. The industrial output value of Guangdong achieves the greatest improvement under low-carbon scenario. It is expected that the industrial output value of which will reach 6.86 trillion yuan by 2030, ranking first in the country. Therefore, the setting of carbon emission scenarios needs to be tailored to local conditions, increase technological innovation efforts, and further promote industrial development.},

By exploring this phenomenon, we examine alternatives for sustainable development during such turbulent circumstances mediating the destruction arisen from the crisis. We unveil the mechanisms that reveal the large-scale digitalisation that emerged as part of the response to managing the crisis. We find that during this crisis in China, the WOPs from policy, technology and demand perspectives facilitated the leapfrogging of the digital transformation in numerous social and economic areas. More importantly, we also discover that the WOPs are unevenly distributed among firms, time, and locations. Based on these results, we put forth that the COVID-19 pandemic brings a relative window of opportunity (RWOP) to society, impacting industries and firms. However, these impacts are disproportionately distributed. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to illustrate how a social crisis leads to WOPs enhancing digital transformation.

Results of mediation effect model show that enterprises’ blockchain innovation activities mainly improve TFP through three channels: alleviating financing constraints, reducing supply chain concentration and inefficient investment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that electronic digital data processing blockchain patents have the highest practical value, while financial blockchain innovation inhibits the improvement of TFP in China. Blockchain innovation can bring positive effects on the TFP of manufacturing enterprises and leasing and business service enterprises. The increase in TFP of leasing and business service enterprises brought by blockchain innovation is nearly 70 times that of the baseline regression.

Yet, previous research has not systematically explored the correlation between the digital economy, QoL, and carbon emissions. This paper explores the influence of the digital economy and of changes in QoL on carbon emissions, using a system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model. To do this we first use principal component analysis to calculate an objective QoL and a digital economy index using provincial panel data in China from 2006 to 2018. The results demonstrate that both the digital economy and QoL exhibit inverted U-shaped effects on carbon emissions. Our results also show that the growth of the digital economy improves QoL while mitigating the influence of QoL on carbon emissions. Thus, these findings illustrate that policymakers can rely upon the digital economy to help reconcile potential conflicts that arise between QoL and carbon emission reduction goals. Overall, these findings add a new dimension to carbon reduction policies. We propose that policymakers can improve QoL and reduce carbon emissions by coordinating the scale and efficiency-enhancing effects of developing the digital economy. In addition, regions that rely on energy industries should consider the efficiency-enhancing effect of the digital economy when formulating provincial and national emission reduction policies. Key policy insights China aims to improve the QoL of its citizens while achieving carbon peak and neutrality goals in the coming decades. This study demonstrates how the digital economy can both improve QoL and reduce carbon emissions. Given the non-linear impact of QoL on carbon emissions, policymakers should not be concerned that climate mitigation policies will deter or damage efforts to generate to QoL improvements. Countries should develop digital economies to improve QoL while simultaneously paying attention to its efficiency improvement effect, which can reduce carbon emissions. Policymakers should focus on the enhanced efficiency improvement effect of the digital economy on the allocation of resources, particularly in regions with energy-intensive industries as economic pillars.},

We observe that only if the carrier with less potential market encroaches could it exist a situation that the forwarder originally linking to the carrier with larger potential market becomes the only choosing mixed agency. Beyond that, the probabilities of two forwarders considering mixed agency simultaneously are relatively small only if the agency fee is low or the substitution degree is high is satisfied. However, the factors influencing whether each carrier encroaches are significantly different. For the carrier with smaller potential market, the agency fee is the most important determinant, whereas the other pays more attention to the substitution degree.},

Based on case studies, a theoretical framework is proposed to explain the key internal and external drivers of SCI and the impact mechanism of SCI on transformation performance. The framework suggests that SCI contributes to transformation performance through five channels: standardisation, operational risk, product modularisation, knowledge sharing, and added value. It also offers preliminary insights on how transformation performance can offer feedback on SCI at different enterprise life cycle stages.},

Our study shows that the upstream CSR leads to an improvement in social welfare, regardless of the downstream market competition mode. However, the impacts of upstream CSR are more significant under Cournot than under Bertrand competition. Moreover, an upstream monopoly with CSR has a stronger incentive to pass on cost savings downwards to benefit consumers. Despite these advantages, being socially responsible does not pay off for upstream monopolies. Therefore, economic support from the government is necessary and important to encourage and promote CSR practices.},

Based on measuring the comprehensive index of enterprise digitisation and enterprise vitality, this paper discusses the influence and mechanism of digital transformation on enterprise vitality. It is found that digital transformation has a positive promoting effect on enterprise vitality, and with the improvement of the level of development vitality, it shows a marginal increasing trend, but with the evolution of the enterprise life cycle, it shows a marginal decreasing trend. Mechanism analysis shows that digital transformation promotes the vitality of enterprises mainly by improving productivity, alleviating information asymmetry and improving resource allocation. With the improvement of regional market integration, institutional quality, scientific and educational resources and industrial upgrading, digital transformation plays a more important role in promoting the vitality of enterprises. There exists obvious industry concentration, executive background and property right nature heterogeneity. The conclusion of this paper provides a series of empirical evidence for enterprises to digitally release their vitality and promote the high-quality development of enterprises.},

Understanding the adoption of digitalization and collaborative digital platform between participants in industry is important, particularly the path of digital transformation and the impacts they create. However, these issues have not been fully explored in the maritime logistics industry. This study thus developed a model that incorporates digitalization, digital logistics platform adoption, organization’s digital transformation, as well as organizational performance, and examined the associations between them through six research hypotheses. Postal questionnaires were distributed to shipping companies, port operators, shipping agencies, and ocean freight forwarders in Taiwan. The survey yielded a total of 165 valid responses. Subsequently, CFA was applied to verify the model, and SEM was employed to examine the proposed hypotheses. The main findings of the study indicate that enhancing digitalization and embracing digital logistics platforms can significantly contribute to digital transformation. Both digitalization and digital transformation have a positive impact on organizational performance. However, the adoption of digital logistics platforms currently demonstrates an insignificant effect on organizational performance at this stage. Consequently, leveraging the lens of network effects theory, the findings are further discussed, and implications are suggested.},

With the development of the digital economy, digital transformation is affecting the evolution and upgrading of many traditional enterprises, including maritime enterprises. In the post-COVID-19 era, start-up small and medium-sized enterprises will need to consider the importance of enterprise risk management to achieve transformation and upgrading. The purpose of this study is to provide guidance for the establishment and upgrading of risk management systems for start-ups based on the identification of risk management strategies of maritime enterprises and the evaluation of their performance. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and importance-performance analysis methods were used to rank the operational risk, financial risk, market risk, innovation risk, and disaster risk according to sub-items and screen out the risk management schemes for priority improvements. Through empirical research, it was found that the financial risk and market risk response schemes have the lowest performance and need to be prioritised for improvement. This study argues that start-ups can appropriately challenge their risk management strategies to meet potential risk management needs based on their own circumstances.},

To perform AS-ALD, area-deactivation or -activation processes should be implemented in advance using selective surface modification through a photography-based lift-off process and printing techniques. This study introduces a novel approach for Al2O3 AS-ALD using inkjet-printed inhibition patterns. ALD-inhibition patterns with two-layer structures of fluorocarbon (FC) thin film and photoresist (PR) were patterned by inkjet printing. Low surface energy FC thin films were used to block the Al2O3 nucleation and growth during the ALD process, and PR was patterned to easily remove ALD-inhibition patterns using a lift-off process. To demonstrate AS-ALD, an Al2O3 thin film approximately 10 nm thick was deposited via an in-house built system with a multiple-slit gas source. The proposed AS-ALD method was evaluated for topological analysis using atomic force microscopy and surface composition analysis using a time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry after Al2O3 deposition and a lift-off process. Finally, a 6 nm thick Al2O3 film was selectively patterned by the lift-off process using an inkjet-printed 1.28 μm thick FC-covered PR inhibition pattern.},

Although perceived value is a key driver of smart product/service development with unique experience, existing research has rarely systematically explored the perceived value of smart PSS that can be identified, which could lead organizations to be unable to adapt to this rapid digital transformation. Thus, this study adopted smart kitchen appliances to identify which dimensions of perceived value are influential in the development of the smart PSS with UX. The primary objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a comprehensive perceived value scale of smart PSS; and (2) validate the scale’s stability and goodness of fit. The analysis results of this study show that a one-order confirmatory factor analysis is effective for verifying the scale. Five latent variables, usefulness, flexibility, reliability, fee, and technicality, and 19 observable variables can be used as effective evaluation measurement indicators to demonstrate that a value-based viewpoint is crucial for development of the smart PSS with UX in the organization.},

The objective of this research is to theoretically identify the crucial success elements for DT in container lines by evaluating four main theories: (1) innovation diffusion theory, (2) resource-based view theory, (3) stakeholder theory, and (4) competence motivation theory. Accordingly, the CSFs identified were ‘stakeholder expectations’, ‘organisational competency’, ‘technology acceptance’, and ‘individual motivation’. A survey was then crafted and handed out to major container lines. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was then conducted to analyse the collected data. The results show that organisational competency is the most important CSF, followed by technology acceptance, stakeholders’ expectations, and individual motivation. The top three sub-CSFs are financial stability, regulatory bodies’ expectations, and digital readiness. This research paper contributes to theory and management practices by providing a holistic theoretical framework to identify and rank the CSFs of DT in container lines. Overall, this research paper enriches current literature on the DT of container lines and offers new insights into container lines in the CSFs in the implementation of DT.},

According to cases of common goods in Jeju, South Korea, the coupling effects of several public policies could motivate the privatization of common goods. Second, an empty area in common goods consists of a high level of participation with democratization and a low level of common condition. High participation with democratization can avoid privatization and increase new open business models of common goods. Third, active open innovation with a high participation in democratization and expansion of new business models based on tacit knowledge of common goods could be the activating engine of regional innovation systems.},

In comparison to most other university models that offer, at best, one course in digital marketing, this paper details a blueprint to infuse all courses in the marketing curriculum with marketing theory, digital marketing technical skills, and experiential learning activities. Based on constructive alignment theory, and with assistance of the ADDIE Model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation), the University was able to involve all stakeholders before updating the curriculum and hire and train faculty in a speedy manner to meet market needs. All marketing courses were modernized to incorporate experiential components (e.g., simulations, client projects, etc.) that reinforce relevant marketing theories and specific technical skills. Results show that by integrating digital marketing activities in all courses, graduating seniors developed not only skills but the ability to apply them and a current perspective of digital marketing and analytics that has made it possible for them to enter a career in digital marketing post graduation.},

We analysed the data emerging out of 59 semi-structured interviews and 90 hours of non-participant observation in order to contextualise our investigation within the healthcare setting which in our case was a large hospital undergoing one of the biggest single-site implementation of digital health technology in Europe at its time. Our empirics is aided by ethnographic techniques and Gioia’s methodology has resulted in a grounded model which has implications for both scholars and practitioners. Through discussion with the end-users within the organisation, the findings highlight three processual landmarks which have been theorised using Erving Goffman’s conceptualisation of ‘framing’. In our study these have been referred to as intrinsic, frictional, and transitional frames, depicting the cognitive progression of end-users when interacting with digital artefacts as well as negotiating the institutional complexity. The three dynamic frames exhibit stage-specific occurrences and offer a complete abstract of a very large and difficult digital implementation project. Theoretically, our study offers a basis for scholars to conceptualise the processual nature of digital transformation through the lens of framing. Interactive dynamics remain underrated or largely ignored when it comes to implementation of such large projects, but we make it salient through the three empirically derived socio-cognitive frames. These frames in our view serves as a practical toolkit for practitioners in any setting visualising the implementation of a digital transformation project.},

Notably, a univocal definition of the characteristics of data-driven product service system is still missing. Therefore, this paper represents a first attempt in the systematic definition of data-driven services types and their features as a fundamental step to support their understanding and development. To accomplish this aim, the paper proposes a holistic view of data-driven product service system characteristics, employing a two-level hierarchical conceptual framework for business to business applications. The framework is constructed with a theory-building approach involving multiple industrial companies. The paper eventually reports a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the framework.},

This result is robust after accounting for a series of endogeneity and other tests. A further examination reveals that operation efficiency, information transparency, and reputation are inducement mechanisms. We also find that the promotion effect is particularly more pronounced for state-owned firms in areas with sound product market development and supply chains with lower supplier concentration.

The digital transformation of enterprises has not only reshaped business models and industrial boundaries, but also boosted the high-quality development of China’s economy. This paper reviews the existing literature and discovers that digital technology promotes enterprise production efficiency through cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and innovation. Based on the data of listed manufacturing companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2009 to 2017, this paper constructs a differences in differences (DID) model to empirically study the relationship between digital transformation and production efficiency. The results revealed that the implementation of digital transformation plays a significant role in promoting economic benefits and the results of the lag regression method are still robust. Based on this, combined with the actual situation of Chinese enterprises, this paper proposes countermeasures and suggestions to promote the development of enterprise digital transformation. The conclusion is of great significance for Chinese enterprises to occupy a dominant position in the new wave of global industrial revolution.},

The results suggest that having political connections can significantly improve financial performance and that the quality of internal control plays a partial mediating role in state-owned enterprises. Moreover, when digital transformation is taken as a moderating variable, the role of political connections or internal control in enterprise performance will be weakened. Enterprises should take full advantage of political connections and establish a high-quality internal control system. When enterprises do not have political connections, they can actively carry out digital transformation to change the situation.},

However, by 2019, employment polarization was as high as 94.74% in China, and middle- and low-skilled workers faced severe employment challenges. Therefore, this study aims to explore the impact and mechanisms of the digital economy on employment polarization. To this end, data were collected from 30 Chinese provinces between 2014 and 2019. The results show that the digital economy’s development has intensified job market polarization. Technological innovation further intensifies the structural imbalances of the digital economy’s labor market, leading to employment polarization. However, the information effect and efficient government governance help alleviate the digital economy’s employment polarization. This study advances the focus on employment equity and opportunities for low-and middle-skilled employees.},

Based on 32 semi-structured interviews with local journalists from 20 media organizations across four large cities in China, our study investigates how journalists navigate multiple social media platforms and employ data-driven sourcing as complements to traditional sourcing practices. We find the disruptions caused by the pandemic have unexpectedly converged with the ongoing developments of platformisation and digital transformation in China. We also reveal the subtlety of the field’s refractions of external shocks and structural constraints, as evidenced in journalists’ sourcing practices amid the crisis. Variations in their navigation of multiple sourcing options, i.e., platform-swinging, giving voice to the data or the lingering effect of hysteresis, are identified as contingent on media type and locality, platform affordance and popularity, as well as practical sensibilities towards each sourcing option at their disposal. Expanding the wide-ranging field theory to China’s specific social and political contexts, this study offers a valuable window to discern technology-induced changes and the field’s refraction effect to external influences.},

   abstract = {Background: This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes in emergency department (ED) presentations incurred by patients with alcohol use disorders. Methods: A retrospective quantitative analysis was conducted on patients’ ED presentations between December 2011 and January 2019 in an Australian regional health district. The health district has five EDs serving rural, regional, and metropolitan areas. Patients with alcohol use disorders were divided into two groups for comparison: those who had interactions with the community-based Drug and Alcohol (D&A) services and those who did not. Results: A total of 2,519 individual patients with alcohol use disorders made 21,715 ED presentations. Among these patients, 75.4% did not have interactions with the community-based D&A services. Compared with those who had, these patients were older, more likely to be diagnosed with abdominal pain (26.9% vs 12.0%, p < 0.001) and chest pain (16.2% vs 8.6%, p < 0.001), and had longer mean length of ED stay (7 hours and 41.7 minutes vs 6 hours and 25.6 minutes, p < 0.001). For the patients who had interactions with the community-based D&A services, their 28-day re-presentation rates decreased from 55.5% (2013–14) to 45.1% (2017–18); however, were higher than that of those who had no interactions (41.1% to 32.8%). Overall, 21.9%−24.5% of the patients were frequent ED presenters (i.e., ≥4 visits per year). Frequent ED presenters were proportionately higher among the patients who had interactions with the community-based D&A services, consistently over the relevant years. Although patients with alcohol use disorders frequently presented to EDs, their alcohol use disorders were only identified in 8.9% of their presentations. Conclusions: Patients with alcohol use disorders were often unidentified in EDs. Those who did not have interactions with the community-based D&A services were less likely to be diagnosed with alcohol use disorders when presenting to EDs.},

Most existing studies on journalists’ adoption of and media’s discourse around data-driven journalism have focused on Western contexts. The present study focuses on Hong Kong, a non-Western society where data-driven journalism is nascent. This study applies the diffusion of innovation theory, the technology acceptance model, and the trading zone framework to explain how journalists adopt data-driven journalism and how this journalistic practice is communicated to the public through media coverage. An online survey was conducted with news professionals in local media organizations (n = 255), as was a supplementary content analysis of news articles on data-driven journalism published in Hong Kong media in 2009–2019 (n = 57). Survey results revealed that perceived ease of use and perceived popularity were positively associated with the adoption of data-driven journalism. The more designers were involved in the news production process, the more likely it was for participants to adopt data-driven journalism. Additionally, most media coverage highlighted the positive outcomes of data-driven journalism—particularly its observability and usefulness—as well as the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. The implications of applying data science to news production and the sociotechnical context of Hong Kong are discussed.},

The distinct Chinese context for crisis communication, with both an authoritarian government structure and a digital transformation of society, challenges theories originally developed in the Western countries. To address this issue, this study proposes a three-theme analytical framework to examine crisis communication practices in the Chinese context: (1) an audience (or stakeholder) orientation—focusing sense-making, (2) a proactive and interactive approach—focusing communication, and (3) a community—focused approach—focusing a long-range precrisis perspective.},

Findings reveal that not only is there a positive and interactive relationship between creative workers and ICT, but the combination of creative workers and ICT leads to higher levels of GVA growth. Moreover, creative workers were found to have a larger impact on growth in comparison with traditional human capital measures (i.e. graduates). Thus, findings from this research suggest that the creative class should not only pay attention to socio-economic preferences of individuals, but it must include wider social resources, such as ICT.},

There is, however, a lack of sufficient theoretical research on practical cases, which hampers the development of place quality brand. This study investigates how place quality brand can influence high-quality manufacturing development through an ‘advanced standard system + quality certification pattern’. We employ a moderated mediation model that involves place quality brand, advanced standards, absorptive capacity, and four dimensions of high-quality manufacturing development (quality level, economic benefit, green development, and technology innovation). Partial least-squares structural equation modelling reveals that place quality brand has a significant effect on all four dimensions. Advanced standards partially mediate the relationship between place quality brand and high-quality manufacturing development. Absorptive capacity plays a moderating role between place quality brand and advanced standards; it also moderates the indirect effects of place quality brand on the four dimensions, with a stronger mediating relationship under high absorptive capacity. These findings improve our understanding of the relationship between place quality brand and high-quality manufacturing development and can inform government strategies.},

The results of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-PM) revealed the following: first, self-efficacy did not affect intention directly, but through the chain mediation of expected outcomes and interests. It mirrored the effectiveness-oriented instructional mindset of teacher educators. Second, identity commitment to student teacher learning and a supportive environment at the institution affected self-efficacy but did not affect expected outcomes directly. The multigroup analysis revealed that for those who had attended pre-pandemic online teaching training, a supportive environment significantly affected their expected outcomes when using online teaching. This study argued for the importance of entry-level training to facilitate peer support and mentoring for teacher educators working with online teaching strategies.},

Practitioners and academia have raised attention to develop supply chain traceability (SCT) in the context of Industry 4.0 technologies in order to improve operational efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Drawing on the extended knowledge-based view, this study has collected 303 questionnaire surveys to test the impact of SCT practices on improving food manufacturers’ sustainability performance, addressing on the economic, environmental and social sustainability, with consideration of knowledge integration and environmental dynamism. Our results show that: (1) SCT has a significant positive impact on the three pillars of sustainability performances among food manufacturers. (2) Knowledge integration mediates the relationship between SCT and sustainability performance; (3) Environmental dynamism plays a moderating role in the direct path between SCT and social performance. This study contributes new theoretical insights to highlight knowledge integration in support of traceback investigation for improving sustainability performance a dynamic environment. The results make substantial contributions on better implementation of sustainable food supply chain, to enhance operations and supply chain practices in the food chain, and to support government policymaking in an environmental dynamic context.},

In this regard, the digital economy has an important influence on the industrial structure and economic development, but whether it is conducive to large-scale pig farming (LSPF) needs further study. This study assesses the development level of the digital economy in 31 provinces of China and examines the transmission mechanism of the digital economy in LSPF. The results demonstrate that the digital economy can contribute both directly and indirectly to the LSPF through improved technological innovation, enhanced merchandise sales, and reduced labor costs of raising pigs. More importantly, the digital economy has a significant negative spatial spillover effect on LSPF; that is, it is not conducive to large-scale farming in neighboring localities. The results of the heterogeneity analysis further show that the digital economy is more significant for regions that have been identified as LSPF key and potential growth areas. The findings provide a reference for policymakers and professionals in emerging economies to facilitate the scale-up and sustainability of the pig industry.},

   abstract = {Digital technology can empower citizen journalism as well as state media in authoritarian regimes. China’s propaganda apparatus has undertaken a series of transformations to adapt itself to the changing media environment. This study investigates this adaptive process by drawing on over five million Weibo posts created by 103 newspapers between 2012 and 2019. Results show that through the digital transformation, newspapers are deliberately distancing themselves from their Orwellian past of abstract dogmatism to openly embrace infotainment. A soft-news-centered production model has emerged as the new journalistic paradigm on social media. Not only commercialized outlets but also mouthpiece newspapers produce more soft news than hard news. Regression results further substantiate that soft news is a gateway to propaganda, whose popularity can spill over into propaganda news. For every 100% increase in soft news popularity, propaganda popularity will rise by 38.5% in the following month. News outlets that have garnered attention to soft news can transfer that attention to their subsequent propaganda. These results illuminate how propaganda works in the digital realm, how authoritarian propaganda could be enhanced by infotainment, and why a less political platform could be more susceptible to political intervention.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic forced a dramatic change from face-to-face learning environments to intensive learning environments. This study aimed to identify and quantify the determinants of student learning effects and their conduction mechanism in intensive online environments. Using a structural equation model and a questionnaire survey, this study proposed and validated the relationships among six constructs including student engagement, perceived learning, satisfaction, instructor behaviours, student characteristics, and the state of health, well-being, and sense of community-related (HWC) issues. 306 valid responses from civil engineering students in 19 universities in China were used to validate the proposed relationships. The measurement and structural model evaluation indicated that the model fit of the fitted model is acceptable with x 2/df = 2.548, RMSEA = 0.071, AGFI =0.78, and CFI = 0.93. The results first showed the key factors for student learning effects from the instructor, the student, and the HWC issues with a factor loading greater than 0.8. This study further inferred from the different path coefficients in the fitted model and the mediating model that instructor behaviours greatly influence student perceived learning and satisfaction through student engagement with a contribution of 100% and 58%, respectively; student characteristics have a decisive impact on student perceived learning with a path coefficient of 0.59; HWC issues negatively impact student satisfaction with a path coefficient of −0.11. The findings enrich online education theories in an intensive online environment by clarifying and quantifying the influencing mechanism of the determinants. The findings also advance education practices for students, instructors, and educational administrators by helping them find out their contribution to learning effectiveness and the key factors to improve future online teaching levels.},

To fill this gap, we explore the nexus between digital government and firm total factor productivity (TFP), and uncover the potential transmission channels behind this connection by focusing on Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2017 and utilizing panel regression with firm-, year-, and province-fixed effects. Our findings confirm that digital government has constructive effects on firm TFP. Furthermore, empirical results suggest that this favourable impact can be transmitted through three channels of firm transaction costs and innovation, digital infrastructure construction, and government-market relationships. Further analysis reveals that the beneficial effect of digital government on firms is more significant in provinces with low fiscal transparency and complex topography, indicating that digital government compensates for the disadvantages of low fiscal transparency and inconvenience of steep terrain. Based on these conclusions, we provide suggestions for government digitalization to improve the performance of government-microeconomic complementation.},

Based on quantitative data analyses, first, the article scrutinizes the share of online campaigners among members and the importance of digital campaigning for the toolbox of electioneering. Social media are essential campaign tools even if only about half of campaigners actively participates in such activities. Still, only a small group of campaigners categorically rules out engaging via social platforms. Secondly, the article analyzes which groups of members are more likely to participate in social media campaigning, showing that higher age, being male and holding a university degree is associated with a lower probability to participate in such activities. Additionally, these newer forms of campaigning are rather used by highly engaged members who are familiar with party routines.

Digitization promotes incarcerated people’s social skills, self-esteem, rehabilitation, and re-integration into society. Yet, many offenders are digitally incapacitated because they have never utilised digital technology or because they were denied access to any while incarcerated. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap. In this study, we systematically review the extant literature on prison rehabilitation to explain how the inclusion of digital rehabilitation of offenders makes re-entry successful and guarantees enhanced post-prison life in a digitalised society. To the best of our knowledge, this paper—which relies on the Good Lives Model and the Critical Theory Approach—is one of the first systematic literature reviews on digital prison rehabilitation. The Good Lives Model and the Critical Theory Approach are used in combination to investigate the three realms of digital prison rehabilitation: successful re-entry, post-prison life, and the digital society. We found that most of the prison rehabilitation practices and policies are still offline and do not cater for the digital realms. We conclude that the use of digital rehabilitation could facilitate a smooth transition back into society and ensure an improved post-prison quality of life in a technologically advanced society. By combining current digital technologies with augmented and virtual reality researchers in digital prison rehabilitation can create models that foster a new reality of prison rehabilitation.},

This study employed an explanatory research design involving the use of simulated data to mirror the situation in the banking industry. To this end, the big data analytical approach considered is machine learning that involves a neural network with two-layer feed forward, one hidden layer and five hidden neuron layers created to detect the presence of fraud and classify them into two, viz.: fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities. Both the input and output target samples are automatically divided into training, validation, and test datasets, while the confusion matrix is employed to visualise the percentages of correct and incorrect classifications. Furthermore, the clustering of the fraud indicators was also carried out to group them based on their similarities. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of neural networks in classifying internal fraud into three levels of risks and fraud detection. This is evidenced in the percentage of correct classification (95%) and misclassification (5%) obtained from the confusion matrix. The model also demonstrates the feasibility of clustering the potential red flags of internal fraud. This study provides an understanding into the attributes of internal fraud and a practical guided approach to implement an integrated forensic accounting and big data technology framework for internal fraud mitigation. The forensic accountant should ensure that the machine learning models are regularly updated with new datasets for automatic classification and clustering analysis. There is still scanty information regarding the integration of forensic accounting and big data technology for mitigation of internal fraud risk in the banking industry. Hence, it is envisaged that this study will contribute to the method, theory and practise of internal fraud mitigation.},

   abstract = {This paper explores the Agile methodologies, Scrum and Kanban, to define their advantages and limitations of use. The methods are compared for their use in software development, specifying which would be a suitable option for a game development process focusing on maximizing productivity and quality of the software. Exploration of use cases and methodology guides are discussed, defining the benefits of choosing Kanban or Scrum for a software development team. Findings show Scrum to be a method that focuses on the verbal communication through sprint meetings and reviews. Kanban is described as a visually driven framework that utilizes a Kanban board and cards for communication. Scrum is a strict method can only implement change after a sprint, while Kanban is more flexible and can make changes at any point in the development process. A hybrid of the two methods, Scrumban, is also investigated and found to be an alternative for users who find aspects of both methodologies to be appropriate for their team. There is a great deal of consideration required for independent game developers as they need to reflect on their team dynamics and situation before determining which methodology is best suited for them.},

There are a variety of ways in which such industrial-related policy approaches can be developed and implemented. Varying aspects of industrial and economic innovation often occur within a regional context, which can change policy is developed and implemented, dramatically and with little warning. This paper applies a case-based approach to examine enabling and constraining factors of regional innovation policy in two cases - Ontario, Canada and Massachusetts, US. Moving beyond a linear conception of regional innovation, this research explores how policies and modalities for collaboration can facilitate Industry 4.0 and related innovation ecosystems. Our analysis suggests that regional innovation impact is influenced through four principal factors: industrial clusters; context; collaborative synergies; and network intermediaries. Additional research could focus on an expanded case examination of the relationship between top-down policy approaches and the operation of regional innovation ecosystems coupled with bottom-up market- and stakeholderdriven analytic approaches.},

BDA enhances organizational agility, as it is highly valuable for the identification of opportunities and threats (i.e. the sensing process of agility); however, with the exception of aiding decision-making tools, seizing its benefits for reacting (i.e. responding) is more difficult without organizational adaptation. Hence, the changes required to exploit the full capabilities offered by BDA, particularly at the organizational level, are considerable. From a theoretical perspective, through a narrative literature review, this paper highlights several possibilities of organizational changes for enhancing a company’s agility and leveraging BDA to achieve enhanced performance in turbulent contexts. The findings are then related to three organizational theories. This work ends in a conceptual model and several research paths for future studies. From a managerial perspective, this paper highlights, through several examples, the importance of top management’s role in achieving the necessary organizational changes to enhance the companies’ responding capabilities.},

Hence, it is significant to explore these leaders’ behaviors and practices in times of crisis, the factors that helped them cope with the sudden changes and lead digitally, and the extent that the dimensions of the transformational leadership style had on their performance. Through eight semi-structured interviews, results revealed practices of Arab female educational digital transformational leadership that helped them maintain their own and their organization’s performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. These practices include, building relationships, motivating and recognizing team efforts, open communication, adaptability, a strong sense of emotional intelligence and self-control. While these leaders consider themselves democratic and transformational leaders, an emergent theme showed that they implemented the changes as a coercive activity. This study suggests for policy-makers to form strategies and policies that would increase teachers’ leadership skills in preparation for potential leadership positions.},

It is, therefore, possible for the field of Social Work to draw on these advantages in order to connect with the unconnected by strengthening online mutual support networks among users. The aim of this article is to examine whether ‘connectedness’ in social networking sites improves online social capital and resilience of social service users. Through our analysis of social networks carried out on an experimental model, we observed the patterns of connectedness on Facebook of 50 social service end-users from Málaga, Spain. The detection of online communities through the modularity algorithm has allowed us to ascertain whether individuals’ offline realities mirror their online realities. At the same time, we examined the influence certain interactions (likes, comments, etc.) have on leadership through online ethnography. Finally, online social capital, understood as the combination of connectedness and online interaction, has been correlated with users’ resilience. The results reveal that both connectedness and interaction feed themselves and have correlations with resilience.},

The data comes from Turkey’s 2012 input–output table. The location quotients use industrial employment statistics from the Turkish Statistical Institute. The technological and knowledge intensity classification follows Eurostat. The findings reveal 10 cluster templates in Turkey. Spatial distribution of the highpoint clusters reveals that most regions contain highpoint clusters with low technology and low knowledge-intensive sectors. The results reveal that highpoint clusters in Turkey’s regions contain industries whose technologies do not demand high skills, knowledge and sophistication. Limited existence of high-tech industries and low knowledge intensity in Turkey’s industry composition is a limiting factor for transition to high value-added manufacturing. Special emphasis should be directed towards constructing regional advantage, given the current levels of technology and knowledge intensity.},

The results show that a positive U-shaped nonlinear relationship between insurance density and digital economy, and there is an inflection point in insurance density. When insurance density is lower than the inflection point, an increase in insurance density will inhibit digital economic development; when it exceeds the inflection point, a further increase in insurance density will promote digital economic development. Furthermore, there is a positive U-shaped nonlinear relationship between insurance density and traditional technological innovation, which is conducive to digital economic development. As such, insurance density affects digital economic development through the transmission of traditional technological innovation. The findings have reference significance for developing countries to improve their insurance penetration rate and develop their digital economy to promote economic development.},

Although we acknowledge the need for immediate decisions by educational stakeholders to facilitate online learning, our findings indicate the necessity of (a) careful examination of the features of potential platforms or tools and (b) a trial of such features prior to integration within an educational system. From an instructional design perspective, educational technologists should pay special attention to the degree of gamification, especially beyond the primary school level, as it may negatively impact incentives for student interaction and engagement.

In response, a group of sales scholars recently convened at the American Marketing Association’s Winter Conference to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing salespeople and their firms before, during, and after a sales crisis. Thus, based on this session and subsequent follow-up discussions, this paper develops a framework detailing how the sales function should prepare for, withstand, and learn from a sales crisis. In so doing, we argue that sales crises can originate internally and externally to an organization and can impact the entire sales organization, the sales manager, and/or individual salespeople. Moreover, viewing a sales crisis simply as a turning point rather than a devastating event, we highlight the implications for salespeople and their managers who must inevitably deal with sales crises and the changes involved. Finally, we conclude with potential future directions for sales scholars interested in exploring the impact of crises on the sales function, as the next sales crisis is likely just around the corner.},

   abstract = {Purpose: An ageing population presents a challenge for municipal eldercare in Sweden due to difficulties recruiting staff and there being a strained economy. A strategy involving welfare technology is presented as one such solution. An important group to carry out this strategy involves those who work with welfare technology in municipal eldercare. In this paper we describe their perception of welfare technology, and the challenges and opportunities they perceive in utilizing it. Methods: A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to all Swedish municipalities and answered by 393 respondents. Analyses show that the respondents were representative of the different professions who work with welfare technology within municipal eldercare. Results: Welfare technology was perceived as being more reliable and safer than humans with regards to supervisions and reminders. The respondents acknowledged factors that slowed down the implementation of welfare technology in municipal eldercare organizations, such as resistance to change, lack of finances, lack of supporting evidence, lack of infrastructure, high staff turnover, difficulties with procurement and uncertainties about responsibility and laws. Conclusions: We found that the people who work with and make decisions about welfare technology in municipal eldercare organizations were generally very positive about the deployment and use of such technology, but there appear to be problems within municipal eldercare organizations to realize this vision. The lack of structured implementation processes and coherent evaluation models indicates inequality of the access to welfare technology and, as a result, even though Swedish eldercare is publicly funded, the availability of welfare technologies and their usage differ between municipalities.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION The research findings show that implementing welfare technologies in municipal eldercare must include transformed working processes and long-term strategies or they may lead to conflicts of priorities or unstructured implementation processes. Structured implementation processes and coherent evaluation models are needed for equality of access and availability of welfare technologies in municipal eldercare. High staff turnover negatively affects the deployment of welfare technology and the root cause of high staff turnover needs to be addressed.},

In today's unprecedented business environment, the survival of organisations is in technological advancement and online presence. When masses rely on digital financial payments, there is a pressing need for the financial sector to offer innovative products and services to meet customers’ needs and achieve sustainable performance. This paper aims to investigate the impact of data analytics on the productivity of banks in Pakistan and employed two-step system generalised methods of moments for estimation. The findings suggest that 5.9% productivity is increased for banks that invested in data analytics on average. It was also found that productivity increase is associated with an investment in data analytics compared to a mere investment in any software. However, the moderating role of dynamic capabilities on the relationship between data analytics and banks’ productivity is insignificant, which raises a question on the relevance of research and development expense with human capital development. It is recommended that banks should invest in those analytics that have predictive, visualising and analytical capabilities. The use of these innovative technologies should be combined with training and human capital development to ensure sustainable firm performance.},

The findings revealed that security, privacy, perceived risk, usability, flexibility, and cultural and social interference significantly impact the use of NDIDs. Considering HCCS in NDIDs usage, especially in risk-conscious cultures, is crucial. Low cybersecurity awareness and trust impede NDIDs adoption, emphasizing the need for cybersecurity education and awareness.

In order to develop such radical innovations, organizational separation of innovation efforts has been advocated by many as an effective strategy. We have conducted a longitudinal case study of a radical innovation project at a born-digital company. The company established a separate organization to develop radical innovation, but over time, the innovation drifted from radical to incremental. Even keeping the organization separate proved difficult. In explaining the events in the case study, we follow the argument that new theories of digital innovation can be developed with reference to the specific properties of digital artefacts. We outline how properties like editability and distributability may contribute to innovation drift, i.e., the proclivity of radical innovation ambitions to gradually drift towards more incremental realizations. Due to their nature, digital artefacts can diffuse through the organization and, thus, pose a challenge to the effectiveness of organizational separation as a strategy for innovation. With this work, we contribute to the literature on digital innovation by responding to calls for research on new theories of digital innovation and the demand for greater appreciation of digital materiality in organizing. We also challenge the prevailing view of digital innovations as radical and aim to open a debate on the possibility and considerations surrounding incremental digital innovations.},

Digital image forensics is playing a major role in this direction to identify authentic digital images and has classified forgery detection techniques into two type broadly-Active and Passive. The active process needs to authenticate pictures by taking out the watermark or digital signature inserted in it. On the other hand, passive technique either required using special devices not the original content presented to demonstrate forgery of the picture. This paper proposed a search area optimization algorithm in which we used Normalized Cross-Correlation for feature matching or to detect the highly correlated areas of the forged image and Fast Fourier Transform to optimize the search area by converting the image into the frequency domain. The experimental outcomes portray that copy-paste image forgery can be effectively perceived by using the proposed approach and the computed value of precision rate and recall rate is also higher than the earlier methods},

Increasingly, smart cities are considered as social innovation processes to achieve sustainable and inclusive urban development, being influenced by broader socio-economic and institutional contexts of cities. This paper explores ‘smart city transitions’ across varied urban contexts, in particular, how smart city transitions are enacted and how they contribute to inclusive urban transformation and public value. Using a multiple case studies approach, the research investigated infrastructure planning practices in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Seoul in Korea, Portland in the U.S. and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam, cities that were known for strong efforts to establish integrated platforms to enhance societal benefits. Our analysis showed that each city has addressed its goals around sustainability, equity and affordability by reinforcing the engagement of multiple actors with the support of integrated platforms that facilitate open and multi-directional information flow in a transparent manner. In Amsterdam, innovative solutions for sustainable use of resources have been invented and distributed through multi-level social networks, contributing to the transformation into a circular economy. In Seoul and HCMC, the city's persistent efforts to utilize an open and integrated platform resulted in proactive engagement and collaboration of public and private actors in improving quality, equity and efficiency of transit services. Portland has tackled inequitable access and mistrust issues by setting principles for data governance and facilitating equity in the adoption of innovative technologies. Our research revealed that four cities established different forms of integrated platforms such as a centrally-controlled platform and a community-centred platform in order to address specific socio-economic issues within an institutional setting of each city.

The integration of urban infrastructures with information and communication technologies enables the development of new operations models. Digitised infrastructures offer opportunities for public and private organisations to design and deliver more customer-centric products or services, particularly for those that require geographical proximity with consumers in the online to offline (O2O) context. A framework is developed and used to analyse three case examples. These cases illustrate the emergence of new operations models and, demonstrate how smart cities are redefining the characteristics of operations models around their scalability, analytical output and connectivity. We also explore the feasibility, vulnerability and acceptability of each new operation. This paper contributes to our understanding of how smart cities can potentially transform operational models, and sets out a research agenda for operations management in smart cities in the digital economy.},

We extend the fit-viability model (FVM) and develop a value-based technology adoption model through an empirical study of 242 managers mostly in medical and financial industries. Managers in such organizations are likely to consider fit and viability in adopting blockchain technology to store and protect data. Drawing upon Fit-Viability and Task-Technology Fit models, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), we test a model with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to assess managers’ intention to adopt blockchain technology. Our findings indicate that functional and symbolic benefits have positive impact on managers’ assessment of task-technology fit. Furthermore, viability is an important criterion in adopting blockchain technology.},

The study adopted an exploratory qualitative research approach to investigate resource integration practices among client firms and social media agencies. 29 expert interviews were conducted with senior social media personnel from both client firms and social media agencies. Data analysis was conducted using a thematic analysis approach to analyze interview-based data. The findings specify that client firms and social media agencies can use their shared operant resources to engage in resource integration activities specific to social media, which can lead to higher-order resource formation that can drive value co-creation. Social media marketing research has largely been dominated by consumer-centric studies. Lesser focus has been given to exploring how social media has been adopted by firms, and how they use social media as a part of their marketing strategy. To that end, the current study contributes to the area of firm-centric research on social media marketing by empirically exploring the relationship between client firms and their social media agencies via the conceptual lens of S-D logic value co-creation. Specifically, the novelty of the study lies in its examination of the social media-based operant resources which are exchanged and integrated within the agency-client dyad, as well as the examination of the resource integration activities which underlie said resource exchanges.},

This paper reports the development of a nomenclature system for components to enable better information management in offsite construction projects in the digital era. Firstly, criteria for suitable names are derived from current construction practices, other matured naming practices and information quality requirements. Then, through collaboration with industrial stakeholders to balance different needs and arrive at common understandings, we propose a nomenclature system that confers names upon offsite construction components. The system is validated and refined through a project-level case study and a policy-level focus meeting. The key contributions of this study are to articulate the widespread but rarely explored need for a nomenclature system for offsite construction, to exhibit the criteria for such a system and to describe the process of development with collaboration of the industry. Future research is encouraged to investigate the optimal component level for a name, develop automatic naming tools, and modify and validate the nomenclature system in other regions.},

A conceptual model is developed, tested and validated using an online survey targeting ordinary citizens of the country. Based on 313 responses, the findings suggest that citizen trust and confidence is positively influenced by a government transformation, and this relationship is mediated by both government performance and citizen satisfaction. In addition, the results show that key factors must be met to achieve transformed government through the use of e-government systems: transparency, accountability, and meeting citizens’ expectations.},

This technology, which underpins cryptocurrency, provides an immutable, decentralised, and transparent distributed database of digital assets for use by firms in supply chains. However, not all firms are appropriately suited to adopt blockchain in the existing supply chain primarily due to their lack of knowledge on the benefits of this technology. Using Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC), this paper identifies the adoption barriers, examines the interrelationships between them to the adoption of blockchain technology, which has the potential to revolutionise supply chains. The TISM technique supports developing a contextual relationship-based structural model to identify the influential barriers. MICMAC classifies the barriers in blockchain adoption based on their strength and dependence. The results of this research indicate that the lack of business awareness and familiarity with blockchain technology on what it can deliver for future supply chains, are the most influential barriers that impede blockchain adoption. These barriers hinder and impact businesses decision to establish a blockchain-enabled supply chain and that other barriers act as secondary and linked variables in the adoption process.},

Policy innovation in this sector helps diplomats understand the importance of adopting communicative styles that are in sync with wider societal trends. We review lessons that MFAs have learned and are still learning from operating in data-rich and real-time environments during international crises, and restrictions on their ability to innovate. A more networked " duty of care " , drawing on the use of social media and more analytical digital collaboration with the non-governmental sector, is producing results and often making collaboration a condition of success. Informational aspects of securing nationals abroad are increasingly citizen-driven. We argue that the " digital shift " in consular assistance reveals how MFA effectiveness and legitimacy are becoming more dependent on citizen participation, and that achieving policy objectives has become more underpinned by understanding trends in people's online behaviour. In the years ahead, MFAs are likely to become more explicit in making the argument that a digitally literate and a natively digital citizenry is expected to help governments assisting nationals abroad, and reinforce their emerging view that nationals abroad should assume more responsibility for their own security.},

To address this research gap, this study empirically explored the punctuations and diversity in attention allocation within China’s national e-government issue from 2001 to 2018. By employing the latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to analyse relevant articles on e-government in the People’s Daily, we derived 10 distinct dimensions hidden in the corpora and constructed an original dataset of the e-government agenda. The empirical findings revealed that the information processing in the domain of the e-government in China are leptokurtic, and a gradual decrease in the intensity of punctuations with the enhancement of central coordination and civic participation was also observed. We also found that the dynamics of attention diversity partially followed the theoretical expectations of classic scholarships. By examining patterns of attention allocation across multiple dimensions within a certain policy, our findings speak to literature on PET and agenda diversity and increases the externality of relevant theories derived from the cross-domain analysis.},

Promoting innovation through alternatives to credit means integrating vulnerable and excluded customers into mainstream financial systems.

Even though both types of news consumption are positive predictors of voting at both levels, local news consumption is more relevant when predicting local voting, and national news consumption when predicting national voting respectively. Moreover, the results indicate that traditional media are still a significant positive predictor of local voting while digital media are not. Neither traditional nor digital media platforms play a significant role in predicting national voting.

Together with all the authors contributing to this Special Issue, our objective is to give smart city research more robust scientific foundations and to generate theoretical propositions upon which subsequent large-scale empirical testing can be conducted.

The quantity of information available online today has never been so abundant, and easy access to information calls into question the role, purpose and ‘usefulness’ of museums. A century after John Cotton Dana called for a ‘useful’ museum, in-house start-up hubs where creative entrepreneurs can work, collaborate and create within the museum are being implemented. In doing so, these museums are reimaging Cotton Dana's vision for the ‘useful’ museum into one that is fit for purpose in this digital age. The present article focuses on how three museums are responding to the disruptions provoked by the proliferation of digital technologies and a broader interpretation of the museum's remit, by redefining their role, purpose and practices. By developing a space for creative entrepreneurs within their museums, Te Papa (New Zealand), New Museum (USA) and ACMI (Australia) are redefining what a museum of the 21st century could be. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with senior managers at these museums, this article examines the strategic, practical and theoretical implications that these spaces, commonly referred to as ‘start-up hubs’, have for museum practice.

However, the adoption of I4.0 in developing countries like India needs deliberation in the perception of sustainability. This paper aims to identify sustainable I4.0 barriers and evaluates interrelationship amongst the barriers. Twenty barriers to sustainable I4.0 are determined from the literature review. Expert’s opinions are taken to finalise the identified barriers. Data are collected from Indian footwear industries and have been further analysed using the Fuzzy-DEMATEL approach. The results show that ‘Lack of new organizational policy’, ‘Lack of customer feedback and cooperation towards I4.0 and sustainable practices,’ and ‘Lack of infrastructure’ are the most significant barriers. The study guides the industries of developing economies to formulate an effective strategy for the adoption of I4.0. The future scope of the survey includes an extension to other emerging economies to improve the reliability and validation.},

   abstract = {Nowadays organizations are increasingly engaged in talent management, because it allows firms to grow rapidly by leveraging on human capital. Most antecedent studies focused on expectations and motivations of talents living in developed countries. Though, a little is known about career expectations of talents in emerging economies, and whether they diverge from those of developed countries or not. However, this information might be of use for several motives. First, emerging countries have a high growth rate. Second, these talents may be effectively harnessed from domestic and non-domestic firms, depending on whether their expectations are met or not. Consistently, this study aims at exploring the career expectations of individuals in emerging countries, by capturing the heterogeneity of expectations between emerging and developed countries due to cultural, politic, economic, and religious differences. As a matter of fact, emerging countries are frequently characterized by low levels of both income and employment, differently from many developed countries. For such motives and because of the absence of valid employment alternatives, talents might be more willing to engage in entrepreneurial initiatives rather than attempting to be employed in an organization. Thus, the primary intent of this explorative study is to understand what are the factors that affect career expectations of talents in emerging countries. Consistently, a cross-sectional principal component analysis (PCA) was used for hypotheses testing. The sample refers to a set of African countries, based on data availability for 2019. Data used for the analysis are drawn from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and they refer to individual entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes. Notably, findings show that career expectations of talents are driven by motivation and opportunity, especially in the male groups. However, the study also originally shows that the need for achievement and the willingness to stand out are the main drivers of talents’ expectations. In a nutshell, talents may prefer independence over the employment status. Implications of the findings, at a business level, suggest that companies in emerging markets should revisit their talent management strategy in order to avoid the loss of many talented employees. As instance, they should grant more independence, raise the income, and favour internal and female entrepreneurship. Thereby, the original findings of the study contribute both theoretically and practically to the research domain by specifying that career needs of talented people vary according to context and time.},

A single, qualitative case study research design is employed to conduct an in-depth analysis of a retail SME. The data shows evidence of mimetic pressures that are perceived by the retailer. A trajectory of organizational responses to these pressures are identified by examining the changes that the investigated retailer made in its organization. By probing deeper into retail SMEs’ decisions to use e-commerce as a vehicle for international growth, this article contributes to extending the understanding of how internationalizing retail SMEs can respond to mimetic pressures and adopt e-commerce strategies that provide a fit with their business models. One empirical case provides limited possibilities for generalization. Further studies that can enhance the understanding of retailers’ various responses to mimetic pressures of e-commerce in different contexts are therefore suggested.},

Existing literature shows a slow adoption of DTs in the minerals industry, which is largely due to challenges associated with geological unpredictability, legacy system integration, cost, skill gaps, cybersecurity, and lack of standards. Combining immersive visualisation with real-time spatial computer graphics could improve the usability and acceptance of DTs in the minerals industry which has been used successfully in training while underexplored for operational scenarios. The study concludes by highlighting the need for further research to understand the effectiveness of such an approach in mineral operations.},

This sequential mixed-methods study explores the role of virtual meetings in the generation of process innovations in the Ministry of the Interior of the city-state Hamburg in Germany during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on observations, informal interviews, documents, group discussions, and an online survey, we combine qualitative and quantitative methods to develop, test, and elaborate on a conceptual model. The model describes how and why the virtual meeting format relates to meeting performance and facilitates process innovations in organisations. Our findings show that digital meetings are perceived as equally burdensome, but more effective than face-to-face meetings. We explain this finding by identifying three shared affordances of virtual meetings: effortless attending, sequential speaking and liberated interacting. We theorise that the mechanisms behind the shared affordances in virtual meetings are process constraints, which turn out to be enabling limits for creative collaboration. We conclude that virtual meetings (unintentionally) bring about brainstorming facilitator rules, spur organisational creativity, and therefore turn out to be an (underestimated) practice for stimulating process innovations.},

This is why digital twins have become quite popular in recent years in both rail and road domain applications, and some researchers and engineers have started considering the term as a buzz word that attracts increased interest in their research. In some cases, this leads to misunderstandings regarding the digital twin concept, especially if the discussion relates to digital twins built on physics-based models. This paper’s detailed review has been performed to address this issue considering the application of vehicle system dynamics theories as a basis for development of digital twins and the implementation process in digital twin studies. The results show that most works are focusing on digital twin developments at the ‘top level of the pyramid’ and more comprehensive research and investigation studies are needed in terms of the application of vehicle system dynamics in design and construction of digital twins.

We aimed to explore changes in knowledge, attitudes, and challenges regarding e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine how e-learning has influenced academic performance. METHODS We conducted a self-administrated electronic survey to collect information on undergraduate medical students' e-learning. We evaluated its validity, reliability and pilot tested the instrument. RESULTS Between August 7 and 19, 2020, we received 995 responses. The majority of respondents answered that they knew about the tools used for e-learning, such as mobile learning, links, online classes, e-assessment; 84% (n=836), 82% (n=815), 82% (n=811) and 80% (n=796), respectively. Two-third of the respondents gained fair/very good knowledge from online classes and discussion boards; 65% (n=635), and 63% (n=620), respectively. Regarding attitudes, less than half had "somewhat" adequate knowledge and proper training; 45% (n=449) and 36% (n=361), respectively, and less than a third had "somewhat" positive feelings; 29% (n=289). The reported challenges were poor Internet speed (55%, n=545) and the lack of clinical experience and physical examination skills (51%, n=512). There is a statistical difference between the test score for the first and second semesters for year 6, year 5, year 4, and year 2 (P value < 0.05). CONCLUSION Most respondents reported that they knew about e-learning tools and answered that they gained fair/very good amounts of knowledge accompanied by acceptable attitudes. The challenges need to be addressed to improve e-learning infrastructure. The transition to e-learning accompanied by increased academic performance.},

   abstract = {Brand iconisation refers to the way a brand comes to symbolise the values, needs, and aspirations of the members of a particular cultural group. More than a decade of research has emphasised the many benefits that iconic brands bring to companies and has identified how brands become icons through a process of matching with cultural opportunities emerging in society. However, the way an iconic brand comes to be de-iconicised and how managers can shield brands from this risk is still under-researched. The aim of this paper is to contribute to knowledge regarding iconic brands by following the life of one iconic brand at national level, examining its history and its impact from the point of view of cultural performance. Our research contributes to the field of cultural branding through a genealogical study of how a brand becomes a national icon before becoming de-iconicised as circumstances change. Our research identifies five types of brand episode that can lead to de-iconisation. Our research therefore adds new developments to iconic brand theory. It also contributes to discussing the concept of iconic brand resilience, mainly through the role of cultural intermediaries, such as filmmakers.},

It can be affirmed that the formalization of digital assets in national law will create a legal basis for exploiting the values of digital assets, thereby encouraging the development of innovative enterprises, technological innovation; and this is also a basis for collecting taxes on profits earned from investment activities that contribute to shaping a trading market of a new asset.

We collected data from the training of new operators in a quality inspection workstation. Two distinct scenarios were considered: before and after the adoption of I4.0 technologies. Data from 10 operators were collected in each scenario; the quality inspection cycle was repeated by each operator 30 consecutive times. A 2-parameter hyperbolic learning curve model was used to assess the learning process in the two groups. Results indicated that operators supported by I4.0 technologies had a significantly higher learning rate than those performing the same tasks without I4.0 support. No significant difference was found in the final performance level between groups. Our study bridges a theoretical gap in the relationship between I4.0 and learning by directly comparing the effect of digital support on the training of new employees in a manufacturing environment. We also offer arguments to support managerial decisions with regards to I4.0 adopti-on at an operational level. That allows organisations to prioritise their digitalisation efforts so that the training of operators in workstations can be expedited.},

The study contributes to extant knowledge with a deeper understanding of how brand innovativeness affects brand trust in consideration of the mediating role of MBE in the mobile booking context. Also, the validation of the MBE measurement scale with six dimensions provides valuable insights into the literature of experiential conceptualization.

   abstract = {Background: COVID-19 pandemic is a reason to revise traditional approaches to medical education. The disadvantage of online education is inability to train practical skills. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of training students on an interactive pediatric simulator during distance learning. Patients and Methods: An online survey was conducted during quarantine COVID-19 to clear out the attitude to distance learning of third-year students of the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (n = 150). During training the level of students’ motiva-tion to learn decreased, and what is most important their practical skills deteriorated. Eighty-four out of 150 students had the effectiveness of their training on the multimedia simulator “Filatov. Pediatrics” analyzed. Results: The simulator reproduces clinical tasks using three-dimensional models of children of different ages and genders and has access to personal computers of students. The cases include imitation of a dialogue with a virtual patient, methods of physical examination, the appointment of laboratory and instrumental methods of research, treatment. The use of a pediatric simulator showed greater efficiency in mastering practical skills compared to a group of students who did not use the simulator in class. Summing up the results of the intermediate objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) on physical examination on dummies of the Simulation and Accreditation Center showed better results in the main group (n = 48) compared to the control (n = 36). The students who additionally studied on the simulator completed the tasks on the checklist on a cardiology dummy by 98.3 ± 1.5%. In the control group, the percentage of completed tasks was 94.3 ± 1.3 (p = 0.05). The OSCE for examining the respiratory system on an auscultative dummy revealed 97.3 ± 1.5 and 93.1 ± 1.4%, respectively (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The interactive pediatric simulator is a tool for mastering practical skills of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the use of which the OSCE results are significantly higher.},

This contribution investigates the role of localisation technologies by using an abductive qualitative approach. We analyse how local media managers’ everyday activities shape the capability of creating, identifying, and experimenting with new business opportunities in a local news media market–discussed here for location-based services (LBS)–in a case study of a local news market with local journalists with managerial responsibilities and newsroom managers. Doing so, this contribution comments on activities undertaken concerning evolving technologies. The findings indicate that the selected local media managers do not experiment with LBS, and most organisations use LBS only for advertising. We reveal the factors explaining this finding to be the media managers’ limited information about technological developments, their lack of experimentation within core areas, and media organisations’ constraints to the acceptance of mistakes.},

   abstract = {By drawing on a business model lens, this study proposes that the competitive performance of servitization is higher for manufacturing firms selling long-lifespan products since they better develop the key elements required for transitioning towards integrated Business to Business (BtoB) solutions delivery. Additionally, the study argues that the moderation role of product lifespan is stronger in advanced stages of servitization as it reduces replacement and information costs. To test these hypotheses, this study merges a unique survey of Manufacturing Multinational Enterprises (MMNEs) and the Lifespan Database for Vehicles, Equipment and Structures (LiVES). Results show a positive moderating effect of product lifespan in the relationship between servitization and performance. Following this finding, across firms with high-intensity servitization, the firm that sells longest-lifespan products is predicted to capture most value from servitization. Overall, the present study suggests that the implementation of recurrent services during an extended product lifecycle provides an opportunity for BtoB solutions delivery and product usage optimisation. By including product lifespan in the equation, we improve understanding of why servitization is an excellent mechanism for managing long-lasting industrial relationships and explain why servitization boosts performance in some manufacturing industries but has a neutral effect on others.},

Hence, we focussed on investigating Revans' conceptualisation in a co-located context by paying particular attention to the ‘different forms of learning' that emerged from it. The research setting for this study involved two coworking spaces in Bangalore, India, whose constituents were co-located start-ups and established enterprises. Held from January to March 2020, the study involved conducting exploratory, semi-structured interviews with twelve firms. The findings suggested that in a co-located environment, a) firms learnt ‘vicariously' from a rich, external knowledge base during the enquiry-led Alpha phase b) firms learnt ‘experientially', through learning by doing and reflecting in the implementation-focussed Beta phase c) firms learnt through the process of ‘emergence’ that resulted from personal reflection and team interaction, in the revelatory Gamma phase. This study lends a novel direction in acknowledging that vicarious learning, that is, learning through the experience of others, serves as a starting point for problem-solving in a co-located context. We demonstrate that firms gain familiarity with the problem through vicarious sources, that is, from those experienced co-located firms who had journeyed on a similar path.},

We first evaluate the development status and prospects of FinTech in China and construct theoretical influencing hypotheses. A ‘supply-side’ FinTech development index is constructed using principal component analysis. We employ panel data models and use financial data from 22 listed China’s commercial banks between the year 2013 and 2020 to empirically test the hypothesized relationships. Multiple approaches are used to deal with endogenous problems. We also estimate the impact in a difference-in-difference model specification. The results show that FinTech development effectively facilitates the expansion of bank credit and the relationship continues to hold after remedying endogeneity issues. We further find that the impact is heterogeneous across banks in terms of bank type and bank size, with the impact on state-owned commercial banks being the least significant and the impact on small banks being the most significant. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We surveyed 365 news organizations across 38 countries or regions and inspected their Facebook Messenger accounts with a mixed-methods approach. We found that less than half of the surveyed news organizations implemented Messenger, and only 67 Messengers were responsive—i.e. able to produce at least one response. We used the walkthrough method to interact with the Messengers with 22 pre-defined search queries on information seeking and navigation related to COVID-19. Then we used qualitative content analysis to examine the contents generated by the Messengers. Some Messengers are out of service or could only provide limited services (e.g. generating templated responses or closed-ended options). The Messengers in different news organizations demonstrated great variations in their capacity to understand the queries and interact with the audiences and reparative strategies to handle search failure. We proposed a three-category typology of news chatbots and offered practical and constructive suggestions for news organizations.},

Quality management is becoming increasingly challenging as model variety, and highly complex products harbour the danger of distributing defective products in the market. Data analytics has started gathering the interest of quality researchers and practitioners, who investigate approaches, algorithms, and methods for supporting the manufacturing quality procedures in the context of Industry 4.0. This trend is facilitated by the wide expansion of sensory technology and the accelerated adoption of information systems by the manufacturing firms. Since quality and process control has been identified as one of the major challenges with a high potential of big data analytics, in this paper we investigated the manufacturing quality research field from a data analytics perspective. Specifically, we examined the existing literature, we provided clarity to the Quality 4.0 research field, we synthesized the literature review outcomes, and we identified the research gaps and challenges. On top of them, we proposed directions for future research.},

The results confirmed that expectations and confirmation of expectations have a positive and significant relationship on customer satisfaction with digital assistants.

Against this backdrop, in 2018, the city councils of Barcelona, Amsterdam, and New York formed the Cities’ Coalition for Digital Rights (CCDR), an international network of cities—currently encompassing 49 cities—to promote globally citizens’ digital rights. Inspired by Arendt’s famous quote, this article explores what “the right to have digital rights” may currently mean, drawing on a sample consisting of 13 CCDR cities.

To fill this research gap, this article interprets the adoption of the ‘transformative change’ approach in Europe as a paradigmatic case of multi-level policy implementation in the European Union. Taking advantage of an institutional approach drawing on path dependency, it considers how transformative change is happening in two Member States (France and Germany). It does so by focusing on the policy mix adopted to address grand challenges and the type of governance mechanisms mainly used to secure legitimization and coordination. Albeit within the same EU framework, this article shows a diverse development of the innovation policies in the two Member States with the use of a different mix of policy instruments in line with their traditional domestic institutional contexts. Institutional contexts also filtered the early stages of the responses to the COVID-19 crisis. These results have specific implications useful for policy makers and practitioners in the design and implementation of regional innovation policies across different European contexts.},

We first examine the effects of path-dependent behaviours, manifested as product line retention and extension, on incremental and radical innovation performance. In investigating this relationship, we join the institution-based view and propose that the effects of path-dependent behaviours are contingent on political and economic institutional forces. Using the samples of Chinese listed pharmaceutical enterprises from 2010 to 2016, we reveal that path-dependent behaviours are conducive to incremental innovation but detrimental to radical innovation. More importantly, while economic institutional forces can enhance the effects of these behaviours on both types of innovation, political institutional forces can mitigate their negative impact on radical innovation.},

The advent of new e-businesses, i.e. mobile applications, requires investigation into which are the successful variations of e-businesses that have been selected and retained for surviving the new digital era, and how they have been formed. A mixed qualitative-quantitative business model analysis of 2250 mobile applications of the Google Play Store is proposed. Results are interpreted according to evolutionary lenses. Content apps, whose value is driven by their efficiency, lock-in, design, and ability to add complementary monetisation mechanisms (i.e. In-App purchases) beside the ads value capture schema (or ‘mixed’ for ‘pay per download’ apps), are the ones that can survive digital Darwinism. E-business models and their innovations are the products of evolutionary processes; from that, e-business models should be evaluated and re-evaluated over time according to the modifications of the multi-level environment.},

Identity providers provide identity as a service for the cloud customers to facilitate the access to resources, but often provide no informed choice of the supply arrangements. The cloud customer requires a say in the elements of service that impact their expectations and quality of service–particularly in relation to the security and privacy of information. In this paper, we provide a novel software solution for addressing the problem. It allows for selecting a most trustable provider, in terms of security, privacy, risk, and standards. The application architecture uses a trust evaluation model as a third-party agency for informing the service user of evidence for and against a choice. A case study and application build demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed method in a real cloud environment.},

We use the novel Cross-Section augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) estimation technique which accounts for cross-sectional dependence and cross-country heterogeneity issues. We find a positive impact of renewable and non-renewable energy on economic growth, but a negative effect of financial development on economic growth. We also find a positive and statistically significant influence of ICT on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Renewable energy and ICT diffusion can be considered important determinants of improved economic activity, job creation and better environmental quality. Pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality tests were used to examine the causal relations among the variables. The findings of this study have considerable policy implications for the selected countries.},

This study aims to assess the level of immediate satisfaction of Vietnamese social work students with online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 186 undergraduate-level social work students in a national univeristy in Vietnam completed an online survey on Qualtrics. The results show that students faced multiple problems with their participation in online courses due to the Internet access quality, such as disrupted connection and low-quality sound. Although being unfamiliar with online learning, most students reported no major difficulty, and having support available for their online learning. Students’ level of satisfaction with face-to-face teaching was significantly higher than that of online teaching on all criteria.

However, so far, most of the discussions have been centred on automation technology with less emphasis on training of seafarers who shall operate them. Depending on the level of autonomy, it is imperative that these ships will still be operated by humans either onshore or onboard. Thus, it is critical to identify the training needs of operators and the facilities that will be required to deliver them. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on maritime education and training (MET) of future operators of autonomous and unmanned ships. An extensive review of the literature revealed that currently, there is an absence of a framework for training the future operators of autonomous vessels. Moreover, the exact equipment that will be needed for training is also not known. As the literature on operational requirement of autonomous ships is limited, this paper expanded the review of the literature to industries which have already embraced the autonomous systems and in particular the framework utilised for training the workforce that operates and manage those autonomous systems.},

These changes seem likely to persist after the pandemic. Additionally, other unforeseen events, although likely not as pervasive as the pandemic, could occur at any time. In this context, the ability of salespeople to keep their mental abilities sharp is vital in overcoming challenges and moving forward. This study highlights the emerging psychological capacities that help salespeople cope with new work circumstances following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as dealing with other unforeseen events, and identifies ways to develop these psychological capabilities. Findings from in-depth interviews with 20 salespeople suggest that patience (P), consideration (C), and responsibility (R) are the emerging psychological capacities that motivate salespeople to achieve positive outcomes during and after the pandemic. These capacities can be developed through the exercise of passion and purpose, gratitude, long-term thinking, self-reflection, and self-compassion. We found the P.C.R. framework to fit the existing psychological capital (PsyCap) model, providing nuances to our understanding of PsyCap by proposing a framework with the emerging psychological capacities that salespeople require to succeed in the post-COVID personal selling environment. The study’s limitations and future research directions are also discussed.},

It reflects the decisions and behaviour of individual actors and the functioning of organisations and their management bodies. However, within the sport governance literature there is a notable absence of work focusing on trust. This study examines the association of trust and structural features within national governing bodies’ (NGBs) boards. Research methods: 242 board members of 65 NGBs from Germany participated in an online survey which comprised questions on trust indicators and boards’ structural features. Probit models were employed to analyse the association between trust indicators, individual board membership characteristics, and the boards' structural features. Results and findings: Results suggest that trust is a multifaceted phenomenon, affected by various (beneficial and detrimental) variables in the specific context of NGB boards. The study makes numerous interrelation and governance dynamics recognisable, with board size, board members’ skill differentiation and temporal stability of boards appearing to be particularly relevant. Implications: The paper complements the professionalisation literature and the leadership discussion in the context of sport governance, particularly with regard to trust-enhancing working conditions within boards. The study also aligns to the good governance literature, revealing that in some respects the issue may be seen to be about trade-offs between trust-based effects and their resultant (positive or negative) outcomes for organisation, board or individual.},

However, international tax law has seemingly failed to keep pace with rapid technological developments, which has likely led to inequalities between the tax burden of traditional and digital business models. Thus far, there has been no consensus regarding the issue of fair taxation of the digital economy at the international and EU level. As European policymakers have begun to experience noticeable amounts of pressure to act, several EU countries have pushed forward and introduced unilateral measures to ensure they receive a fair share of the tax revenues pie. However, it is unclear whether national digital taxes can overcome the tax challenges stemming from the increasing digitalisation of the economy. Thus, newly proposed and implemented national digital taxes in Europe are thoroughly elaborated in the context of their relationship with double tax treaty law, the perils of double/multiple taxation, their coherence with European law, their global and regional impact on competition and competitiveness, their contribution to tax revenues and the establishment of fair taxation conditions. The analysis concludes with a presentation of pertinent suggestions regarding national and supranational tax policy.},

The hypotheses deal with the influence of a gatekeeper’s relevance assessment service on a consumer’s decision-making. The empirical findings provide a taxonomy of decisive attribute levels and their part-worth utilities which affect consumers’ decisions. From this, media management recommendations can be derived. Some findings may be worrying for media management. For example, search engines will increase the competitive pressure on journalistic media the better they provide personalised search results. However, the results also indicate that users’ search behaviours open up a large field for media companies’ brand-driven distribution strategies. This is possible because almost half of search engines’ search queries are by brand name or media label. The weakness of media companies is revealed above all in the field of advertising. Nonetheless, media companies are still highly competitive due to their journalistic potential. In view of the research results, media industries should modify their business models in such a way that they integrate more of the superior characteristics, compared with the algorithms of well-known Internet intermediaries, into their editorial journalistic work.},

Yet the online approach for assessment presents a number of challenges, particularly when evaluating clinical competencies. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, reliability and validity of an online Virtual Clinical Encounter Examination (VICEE) to assess non-psychomotor competencies (non-procedure or manual skills) of medical students. Method: Sixty-one final year medical students took the VICEE as part of the final summative examination. A panel of faculty experts developed the exam cases and competencies. They administered the test online via real-time interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual patients, along with faculty and IT support. Results: Student and faculty surveys demonstrated satisfaction with the experience. Confirmatory factor analysis supported convergent validity of VICEE with Direct Observation Clinical Encounter Examination (DOCEE), a previously validated clinical examination.

   abstract = {Digitization and its impact on regions and clusters remains overlooked in the literature, and constitute this present paper’s goal. How does an industrial district transit collectively to the adoption of new radical changes brought about by Industry 4.0? This study explores the role of collective actors and innovation platforms during the early stages of a pilot policy to stimulate a collective transition of an entire MID (Marshallian Industrial District) into Industry 4.0. We posit that institutional isomorphism and the existent social capital in MIDs is a double-sword phenomenon that can also positively constitute an enabler for fostering change on a collective-basis. Technology transitions, such as Industry 4.0, can be supported and led by collective actors that are central in facilitating the adoption of Industry 4.0 in MIDs, enticing innovative firms to engage in that transition, establishing, legitimizing, and embedding a new set of processes, practices and inter-firm arrangements for digitizing and then promoting imitation: the positive leverage of isomorphism. Thus, MID transition is facilitated through capitalizing on the MID logic of cooperation-competition and isomorphism, by developing and promoting a collective understanding of the new paradigm, building a supportive infrastructure, educating in the new technology and avoiding cognitive inertia.},

This article examines the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on platform-based food-delivery drivers in China, particularly focusing on labor conditions. Drawing on 52 in-depth interviews with drivers from top Chinese food-delivery platforms, this article shows that the precarity of drivers’ work and life is dramatically amplified by the pandemic, resulting in escalating work insecurity, financial instability, and subservient class identity. More specifically, drivers struggle with increased physical risks, livelihood crisis and inflamed racism. All this results from the reorganization of algorithmic labor process and management facilitated by the coalition of food-delivery platforms and Chinese states, which results in surged workload, unpaid labor, uncompensated prolonged production time and extra investment in production assets.},

However, few studies examine how digital finance affects corporate investment efficiency. We use the data of Chinese A-share listed companies for 2011–2017 and the provincial digital finance index developed by Peking University to document that digital finance significantly improves corporate investment efficiency. Our findings are supported by extensive robustness tests. In addition, we identify two mechanisms by which digital finance may affect corporate investment efficiency: by reducing financing constraints and stimulating corporate innovation. We find that digital finance has a more pronounced effect on non-state-owned enterprises, small firms, firms in the central and western regions of China, firms with fewer loans, and firms with a higher dependence on external financing, indicating that digital finance increases the inclusiveness of financial markets. Finally, our economic consequences test shows that digital finance increases the total factor productivity of firms. Overall, this study provides insights for developing countries. In particular, it suggests that digital finance can increase firms’ resource allocation efficiency.},

This study focused on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) for a critical engagement with the theory that researchers have already been employing in sport tourism research, and tourism ideal affect developed based on the affect valuation theory for those that have yet to be critically applied in sport tourism. The study aimed to investigate (a) TPB’s predictive power of intention and actual behaviour in sport tourism contexts, and (b) whether such predictive power can be enhanced by adding tourism ideal affect. Two-wave data collection was implemented in Japan, involving 418 adults. The findings demonstrated that TPB could significantly predict intention and actual behaviour in sport tourism contexts. Subjective norm predicted intention, while intention predicted sport tourism behaviour. Although adding tourism ideal affect did not improve the predictive power of intention and actual behaviour, tourism ideal low-arousal positive affect was found to be negatively related to sport tourism behaviour. Along with theoretical contributions, this research suggests that strengthening promotions involving tourists’ significant others (e.g. adding family components) by targeting Japanese people who have a lower level of tourism ideal low-arousal positive affect may be an effective approach to further sport tourism development in Japan.},

However, how the affordance of such components influences perceptions and behaviors of consumers remains unclear. We extend stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory to the online review system. Specifically, we combine affordance theory and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to investigate the relations among the affordance of review systems, consumers’ perceived beliefs, and their loyalty. Methods: We surveyed 320 customers on their online shopping experiences in China. We tested our hypotheses using the partial least squares path structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. We report the direct effect of affordances of review components on consumer loyalty and its indirect effects on consumer loyalty through perceived beliefs. Results: Our results show that integrity and social interaction affordance of review components have significant relations with perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived enjoyment. Intelligent topic mining reveals a positive relation on perceived enjoyment. Operability has a positive relation with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. These three consumer-perceived beliefs can mediate, to different degrees, the relationship between affordance of review components and consumer loyalty. Conclusion: This research takes an innovative approach to offer insights into the relationships between IT affordances and consumer perceptions. We examine S-O-R theory through the lens of information technology and extend S-O-R theory by integrating IT affordances. Our research findings pave the way for businesses to design and implement more effective online review systems.},

   abstract = {Currently, knowledge networks develop to establish common data spaces. A common data-space offers mutual exchange and reusability for data sources and their derived information and provides access to structured knowledge and even creates wisdom. The geospatial domain becomes included in those knowledge networks and, therefore, creates spatial knowledge networks. ‘Geospatial’ is moving from a special expert domain to a ‘normal’ common data source that is processed for specific data science use cases. Maps with their different levels of abstraction according to its transmission task may offer (1) strategies to enhance processing performance, due to its abstraction, (2) persistent references of map features throughout different scales (abstractions) and (3) improvement of the transmission of spatial information, which includes the transmission interfaces as well as geo-communication. This paper tries to identify new functions for maps in new developing application areas. For example, a ‘universal semantic structure of topographic content’ could help to establish relations/links across domains that only have their own feature keys. We try to set the scene of cartography in a common data-space and highlight some requirements in the world of spatial knowledge networks, which are needed for automatization, machine learning and AI. According to Gordon and de Souza location matters: ‘Mapping is not simply a mode of visualisation, but a “central organizational device for networked communications”, an adaptive interface through which users can access, alter and deploy an expansive database of information, and a platform to socialize spatial information through collective editing, annotations, discussion, etc.’ [Gordon, E., & de Souza e Silva, A.

Quarterly observations from 1998-2020 have been utilized for the advanced-panel model entitled Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR). The initial findings confirm slope heterogeneity, interdependence between the cross-sectional units, stationarity properties, and panel cointegration. The results through FM-OLS, D-OLS, and FE-OLS justify that energy innovations, digital trade, and environmental regulations control ecological damages. In contrast, economic freedom and growth are causing more damage to nature, like ecological footprints (EFP). Similarly, the results through MMQR confirm that the impact of energy innovations, digital trade, and environmental regulations is accepted as a panacea to control environmental degradation in G7. However, the magnitude of the coefficient varies across different quantiles. More specifically, the findings show that the impact of energy innovations is highly significant at 0.50th quantile. In contrast, through digital trade, the impact on EFP is only significant under medium and higher order quantiles (i.e. 0.50th, 0.75th-1.0th). Contrarily, economic freedom is causing more EFP across all the quantiles, where the findings are highly significant at 0.75th quantile. Besides, a few other policy implications are also discussed.},

This means that physicians must increase the time spared for each patient again by the precise proportionality. This may lead to exposing the accuracy and quality of the course of action to be taken for the patients. Increasing the physician’s required time for one patient means that the physician can see fewer patients. This will create an issue with the medical management authority as more physicians are needed, and higher expenses will be required. Purpose: The two questions that arise here are 1. Identify the potential opportunities and challenges for extensive data analysis in the healthcare sector. 2. Evaluate different ways in which big medical data can be analyzed? Methods: The authors identified the four concerned parties representing the four potential solutions dimensions to answer these two questions. These parties are 1. physicians, 2. health information systems management (HISM) departments, mainly the EMR system, and 3. Health management departments 4.

This article first discusses various notions of resilience, especially unpacking state-centred and societal approaches to resilience. In the empirical section, it identifies and compares the views and approaches to the resilience of the EU and Ukraine. The qualitative content analysis shows that their views on resilience identified in the official documents have differed substantially over the last few years. Yet, the top-down (or state-centred) approach clearly dominates in both environments. While the EU links resilience to stabilisation of the area, Ukraine has formulated the concept only recently, connecting it first with the desire to belong to the EU community, but soon tested it in the face of a Russian attack. Therefore, the war has triggered severe discussion, not only about the future commitment of the EU to the Eastern region but also pushes both actors (often unwillingly) towards adapting their societies in a rapidly changing world and possibly towards reformulating the concept as such.},

   abstract = {Open systems have been of interest to the research and industrial community for decades, e.g. software development, telecommunication, and innovation. The presence of open manufacturing enterprises in a cloud calls for broadly interpretable models. Though there is no global standard for representation of digital models of processes and systems in a cloud, the existing process modelling methodologies and languages are of interest to the manufacturing cloud. The models residing in the cloud need to be configured and reconfigured to meet different objectives, including complexity reduction and interpretability which coincide with the resilience requirements. Digitisation, greater openness, and growing service orientation of manufacturing offer opportunities to address resilience at the design rather than the operations stage. An algorithm is presented for complexity reduction of digital models. The complexity reduction algorithm decomposes complex structures and enhances interpretability and visibility of their components. The same algorithm and its variants could serve other known concepts supporting resilience such as modularity of products and processes as well as delayed product differentiation. The ideas introduced in the paper and the complexity reduction algorithm of digital models are illustrated with examples. Properties of the graph and matrix representations produced by the algorithm are discussed.},

On this basis, the study uses multiple empirical methods to analyze the effect of digital finance on inclusive green growth. The results reveal that digital finance significantly promotes inclusive green growth through the mechanism of technological innovation. In addition, the threshold regression model indicates that digital finance has a marginally increasing effect under single threshold constraints of its development level and coverage breadth. However, digital finance has a marginally decreasing effect under the single threshold constraint of traditional finance development level. Finally, a heterogeneity test indicates that digital finance significantly promotes inclusive green growth in regions with low per capita GDP, those with a high agricultural GDP percentage, and central and western regions.},

We focus on two forms of IT strategies: digitalization and embeddedness in IT outsourcing networks.

Investing in technical network control security systems such as anti-virus and intrusion detection systems reduces external breaches. Implementing identity and access management security systems such as biometric scanning and user authentication decreases internal breaches but increases external breaches. However, organizations’ embeddedness in IT outsourcing networks weakens the impacts of these technologies investments on external breaches but amplifies the negative relationship between identity and access management security systems and internal breaches. Our results offer an alternative understanding of organizational IT security investments and explain contrary results found in prior studies. Practical guidelines on organizational IT security strategies are discussed.},

This study examines how the digital economy impacts enterprises’ substantive green innovation and its mechanism using data drawn from a sample of Chinese listed companies covering 2011–2019 and focusing on internal control and long-term investment. The findings of a mechanism analysis indicate that the digital economy can significantly enhance enterprises’ substantive green innovation by promoting the quality of internal control and stimulating long-term investment. Incorporating internal governance and agency issues into the research framework reveals that a higher level of corporate governance enhances the facilitation influence of digital economy on enterprises’ substantive green innovation. Heterogeneity test results show that digital economy has a peculiarly significant role in enhancing the substantive green innovation of enterprises with a high proportion of management ownership. Not only does this study enrich the research on the microeconomic consequences of digital economy and the drivers of enterprises’ green innovation, but its implications also suggest that China should accelerate the construction of new infrastructure and the green transformation of domestic enterprises.},

Through the cases of the US and India, the authors conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the global digital divide between the two worlds, affecting core social sectors like education and health. The larger implication of this is a broadening inequality between the Global North and Global South in leading development indicators like the Human Development Index.},

By merging these perspectives, these authors advocate a diversification of meaning and scope which underscores the involvement of actors in the social (re-)construction of regions. A new analytical perspective on smart regions will be suggested that distinguishes between the three dimensions of discourse, implementation and regulation and refers to concomitant spatial effects as well as to implications for planning practices and procedures. Therewith, the paper encourages critical reflection on normative concepts of smart regions as well as on the usability of ICT for solving local problems.},

However, the advent of hybrid media systems during the last decade(s) has altered how journalists cover politics and how audiences consume relevant content. In this context, live blogging has emerged as a web-based alternative to traditional TV broadcasting. To explore whether and in which forms the trend toward hybrid media systems is empirically traceable in current journalism practice, the present study focuses on political live blogging from four popular media outlets covering the two 2020 US presidential TV debates. It applies a discourse-oriented, mixed-methods, corpus-based approach and specifically considers sourcing practices as well as the normalization of professional role conceptions and practices of objectivity. Results suggest that political live blogging establishes multi-layered and multi-authored discourse that places strong emphasis on accountability and disclosure transparency by updating and linking information, while maintaining the journalistic gatekeeping/gatewatching function. It further emerges that political live blogs are characterized by an informal tone but also by a continuation of traditional news media practices as regards objectivity, as instantiated by the salience of debate topics and political terms and by a clear delineation of information from opinion and contextualization.},

By conducting situational analysis of publicly available policy documents and official government communication, the paper traces how pandemic platforms contract and expand in response to evolving pandemic management needs, and gives an account of the evolution of institutional dependency across different domains of authority and technology development. Using Vietnam as a case study, this paper contributes to ongoing theorisation at the intersection of platformisation and infrastructuralisation in pandemic social service provision. The paper is an invitation to examine the increasing entanglements of technology and citizenship performances around the world as they unfold throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond.},

   abstract = {There is a large body of research investigating the impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) on economic growth; however, the empirical evidence on growth and its volatility simultaneously driven by ICT diffusion has still remained scarce so far. To fill this void, system two-step generalized method of moments (S-GMM) estimator and a new proxy capturing the product of growth and its fluctuation is employed to determine the nexus between ICT penetration and the interaction of growth and its volatility. Using a comprehensive panel of 122 economies covering the period 2000–2019, we find that all proxies for the ICT revolution show positive impacts on the product of growth and its volatility. This means that an increase in ICT diffusion could lead to both higher growth and lower growth volatility. To offer robust and consistent results, ICT growth and its volatility nexus are confirmed through several econometric techniques such as panel quantile regression, the control of fixed effects, alternative measure for the interaction between growth and its fluctuation, and across countries with different national incomes. The research could give rise to use of this proxy for the product of growth and its volatility with inverse hyperbolic sine transformation in the empirically econometric model for the future studies.},

Drawing on concepts from Beck’s critical theory of the risk society and critical discourse analysis, this study examines the public discourse on risk events during the launch of NemID, a personal digital identifier for Danish citizens. This research illustrates our difficulties and challenges in managing some of the fundamental social risks from societal digitalisation. Limited institutional capabilities for digital technologies force public officials to depend on private companies motived by profit instead of the public interest. Beliefs in digital technology as the primary determinant of social and economic progress also present many public management dilemmas. When digital risk events occur and citizens’ fears are stoked by news media and public discourse, public officials seem to have no other strategy for managing the escalating fears than systematically distorted communication. The continued rise of the digital risk society demands that IS research respond to the challenge of generating knowledge for its public management.},

   abstract = {Can mobile payment platforms (MPPs) elevate Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) healthcare service quality (HSQ)? In a region home to more than one billion people yet beset by a paucity of services and infrastructure, mobile devices and platforms are rapidly gaining ground. Rising healthcare needs and costs along with the fact that more than 60% of SSA lives in areas nearly 1.5 miles away from paved roads that lead to hospitals and banks, accessibility to traditional financial services remains a serious concern. As Sub-Saharan hospitals increase billing access via mobile payment platforms, there is little understanding of whether and how mobile payment platforms influence healthcare service quality (HSQ). Drawing upon economic utility and trust perspectives, this study develops an integrative model to examine mobile payment platform utility’s impact on patient trust, commitment, and HSQ perceptions. The model is empirically tested using a survey of 527 patients from the West African country of Nigeria. Results reveal a distinct amalgam of MPP utility, trust, and commitment as antecedents to HSQ perceptions, thus generating important insights and contributing to the ongoing inquiry of how digital platforms in developing countries can influence socio-economic development. Overall, the results support the study’s hypotheses and underscore the important role of MPPs.},

This is because of its potential to cause drastic and widespread shifts in many aspects of life that are comparable to those of the Internet and smartphones. More specifically, generative AI utilizes machine learning, neural networks, and other techniques to generate new content (e.g. text, images, music) by analyzing patterns and information from the training data. This has enabled generative AI to have a wide range of applications, from creating personalized content to improving business operations. Despite its many benefits, there are also significant concerns about the negative implications of generative AI. In view of this, the current article brings together experts in a variety of fields to expound and provide multi-disciplinary insights on the opportunities, challenges, and research agendas of generative AI in specific industries (i.e. marketing, healthcare, human resource, education, banking, retailing, the workplace, manufacturing, and sustainable IT management).},

We used a mixed-method analysis on a set of papers collected for a comprehensive review to identify common themes, components, and patterns that repeatedly emerge within Australian-based digital health studies. Three major and four child themes were identified as the foundational aspects of the proposed ontology. The child themes have more precise concept definitions, inherited and distinguishing attributes. Out of 179 recognized concepts, 33 were related to the Healthcare theme; 23 concepts formed a cluster of employed devices under the Technology theme; 40 concepts were associated with Use and Usability factors. 60 other concepts formed the cluster of the consumer–user theme. The theme of Digital Health was seen as being connected to 2 independent clusters. The main cluster embodied 21 extracted concepts, semantically related to “data, information, and knowledge,” whilst the second cluster embodied concepts related to “healthcare.” Different stakeholders can utilize this ontology to define their landscape of digitally enabled healthcare. The novelty of this work resides in capturing a consumer–centered perspective and the method we used in deriving the ontology–formalizing the results of a systematic review based on data-driven analysis methods.},

While chatbots can be used in various disciplines, they play a particularly significant role in medical education. We present the development process of OSCEBot ®, a chatbot to train medical students in the clinical interview approach. The SentenceTransformers, or SBERT, framework was used to develop this chatbot. To enable semantic search for various phrases, SBERT uses siamese and triplet networks to build sentence embeddings for each sentence that can then be compared using a cosine-similarity. Three clinical cases were developed using symptoms that followed the SOCRATES approach. The optimal cutoffs were determined, and each case’s performance metrics were calculated. Each question was divided into different categories based on their content. Regarding the performance between cases, case 3 presented higher average confidence values, explained by the continuous improvement of the cases following the feedback acquired after the sessions with the students. When evaluating performance between categories, it was found that the mean confidence values were highest for previous medical history. It is anticipated that the results can be improved upon since this study was conducted early in the chatbot deployment process. More clinical scenarios must be created to broaden the options available to students.},

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) helps radiologists efficiently extract and diagnose the abnormal portions. The healthcare market is currently experiencing rapid development owing to the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper proposes a framework that integrates machine learning and intelligence-based e-Health service systems that can be used as an application of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. This framework consists of a classification approach for diagnosing the abnormalities in lung CT images using a whale optimisation algorithm (WOA) optimised wavelet neural network (WNN). WOA optimises the input features, initial weights, hidden nodes, momentum constant, and learning parameters of a WNN in the proposed system. The proposed approach extracts the Laws 16 Texture Energy Measures (LTEM) from the preprocessed CT lung images and classifies the abnormal regions with the help of a WNN classifier. The proposed framework is evaluated using a publicly available COVID-19 dataset that contains both theCOVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. The result shows that theproposed approach has a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 73.3%, and an accuracy of 84.8%.},

Digitization, in a fully digital paradigm, refers to practices that leverage advances in onsite, image-based modeling and volumetric recording, integrated databases, and data sharing. Such practices were implemented in 2014 during the inaugural season of the Kaymakçi Archaeological Project (KAP) in western Turkey. The KAP recording system, developed from inception before excavation as a digital workflow, increases accuracy and efficiency as well as simplicity and consistency. The system also encourages both practical and conceptual advances in archaeological practice. These involve benefits associated with thinking volumetrically, rather than in two dimensions, and a connectivity that allows for group decision-making regardless of group location. Additionally, it is hoped that the system's use of almost entirely "off-the-shelf" solutions will encourage its adoption or at least its imitation by other projects.},

This contribution presents a consolidated model of LM which has proved highly successful in improving both overall efficiency in operation rooms and patients’ perceived value of efficient hospital care. This model is based on a real case study carried out over a 3-year period. A surgical process improvement team was set up, which then designed a Process Value Flow Map using LM tools, and detected opportunities for improvement. The map reflects the patient’s journey through the process, the flow of information and materials for optimising processes. Findings from the three improvement projects described in the paper were used to (1) enhance waiting list management, (2) improve operating room scheduling criteria and sharing of surgical resources, and (3) create continuous improvement teams. The results of the study are twofold: (1) reduced waiting times for operations and (2) increased efficiency of operating rooms stemming from a cultural change in surgical resources management, particularly activity planning. A notable increase in surgical efficiency indicators was also observed, as well as the need to incorporate Lean principles into surgical intervention programming.},

   abstract = {The global economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic is posing more challenges and problems than expected. Amid the re-building, innovation and entrepreneurship driven by digital technologies are still considered by many as the two important pillars of the regional economic recovery. In East Asia, for example, digital technologies have proven to be effective solutions to not only the pandemic and lockdowns but to the problems of post-pandemic recoveries. This collection explores this to substantiate our hypothesis from multiple aspects. We find that open innovation is an important digital strategy for firms during the post-pandemic era. The entrepreneurial performance of digital start-ups is notably influenced by information and communication technology and artificial intelligence. Simultaneously, the development of digital ventures needs additional help from government policies and local cultural institutions. These findings enrich our understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship in East Asia especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

In order to address this prominent and critical research question for IS research, we conceptualize and operationalize data analytics skills at the individual level and develop a nomological network model to examine its critical antecedents and outcomes from the lens of adaptation structuration theory. We test our core proposition and research model using survey data collected from 258 frontline employees of three data-intensive research institutes in China. We discover that data-driven culture, data analytics affordance, and individual absorptive capacity are positively associated with employees’ data analytics skills, which in turn, have positive influences on their task and innovative performance. We classify the employees into digital immigrants and digital natives based on age and examine the different influences of three salient antecedents on data analytics skills between the two groups. The research findings suggest that data-driven culture plays a more significant role in driving data analytics skills for digital immigrants, while data analytics affordance exhibits a stronger influence on data analytics skills for digital natives.},

In this study, we examined the role of ICT in environmental sustainability for a panel of 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. We used an annual dataset obtained from the World Bank covering 40 years (1980–2019). Our empirical strategy was based on the standard fixed effects panel and the Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond dynamic panel approach. Our empirical findings highlight the importance of using ICT to promote environmental sustainability. Additionally, we identified the mechanisms through which ICT can affect the environment, namely education, transportation, foreign direct investment, regulatory quality, and institutional quality. The present study has critical implications for combatting climate change. Policymakers should pay attention not only to ICT but also to other identified mechanisms that play complementary roles in promoting a sustainable environment.},

Identity motives are uncovered as a likely explanatory construct, as those with externally focused identity motives generally adopted these technologies while those with internally focused identity motives generally did not. Identity motives appear to influence entrepreneurs’ perceptions of technology affordances, potentially moderating the impact of these perceptions on technology adoption decisions. Contrary to conceptualizations of individual resilience being a trait or process, we find support that resilience is more appropriately viewed as a mindset.

The results of the study show that fintech makes corporate investments more efficient and that this beneficial impact is long-term; as fintech develops, it plays a greater role in increasing corporate investment efficiency. Based on heterogeneity research, the effect of fintech in boosting corporate investment efficiency is more pronounced in non-states, growth periods, and corporations with weaker internal and external governance. From both aspects of inefficient investment, fintech alleviates under-investment and inhibits over-investment, with a higher inhibitory effect on over-investment. Through a mechanism analysis, we found that fintech has a stronger mitigating effect on under-investment in corporations with higher financing constraints and a stronger inhibiting effect on over-investment in corporations with larger agency conflicts. The conclusions of this study provide critical information for promoting fintech adaptation to corporate needs and high-quality economic development.},

For corporations it means rethinking strategies and auto-cannibalisation of business models. For policy-makers in manufacturing nations it is supposed to raise national competitiveness and bring manufacturing home, potentially blocking developing nations from creating jobs through attracting labour-intensive manufacturing. Its effects on work and employment are forecast to be complex, potentially heightening inequality by reducing demand for low levels of skills. South Africa has a significant skills shortage, due to failings in its education system, limiting the supply of managers, researchers and workers needed for 4IR. There are also problems of poor quality infrastructure, reflecting weak governance and state capture. It has a poor record in policy formulation and implementation, especially across departments, with notable delays in cybersecurity and data protection. There is only a small domestic market and, despite aspirations, it is not an easy gateway to the rest of Africa, which has strong demographic growth but limited spending power and poor physical distribution systems. Moreover, South African firms have to compete with a strong Chinese presence.},

The following aspects of DL were measured: awareness of the mechanisms of communication with other Internet users and any threats resulting thereof, understanding what sexting is and what is meant by invasion of privacy, knowledge about copyright, ability to verify the credibility of information available online (the least developed area of DL), awareness of cyberbullying and the prevention thereof (the most developed DL skill), and the security of online financial operations. The study was conducted in the second half of 2016 in Poland and was commissioned by the Ministry of National Education responsible for the Bezpieczna+ (Safe+) project. The survey was carried out among 421 lower-secondary school teachers (covering three grades for children aged 12/13 to 15/16) from all over the country. The research results can be generalized at α = 0.95 level. The teachers surveyed showed different levels of DL. The teachers of technical subjects (including ICT) obtained the best results, whereas natural science teachers scored the lowest. Age was not a determinant of ICT expertise. A low level of DL and safety skills prevailed in the group of teachers who recently began their career in education (trainees). The group of beginner teachers in particular should be given educational support. This research also breaks the stereotype that young teachers have much more advanced DL than older teachers.},

The proposed method combines different techniques that aimed at assessing the maturity of organisations regarding specific issues and indicating improvement opportunities. Our propositions are illustrated through two case studies carried out in a large Brazilian public hospital and in a private hospital in India, allowing a comparative analysis in which we identify similarities and divergences in improvement priorities in each institution. Findings indicate that the proposed method supports the systemic integration of I4.0 technologies into healthcare organisations regardless hospital ownership, as digital applications are ranked according to their potential to solve the problems prioritised by managers from both case studies. Digital integration in healthcare organisations has been restricted to specific sectors, departments, treatment or processes. Due to high complexity of hospitals, most of these initiatives have fallen short on results, frustrating managers’ efforts. Thus, our method provides hospitals’ managers, authorities, and governments guidelines to prioritise the digitisation of healthcare organisations.},

However, the secrecy surrounding cyber attacks and how organizations manage their cyber resilience make it impossible for stakeholders to develop this understanding.

Using the PRISMA methodology, we collated and analyzed a dataset of 1,145 publicly known cyber attacks. We conceptualize and operationalize cyber resilience from a governance perspective. Our findings indicate that organizations that suffered cyber attacks had the following cyber resilience characteristics: a relatively low level of cyber resilience reflected in the low frequency of cybersecurity roles, low reliance on cybersecurity frameworks, and relatively low strength of prevention, detection, and recovery controls. Cyber resilience is found to be associated with the sector, size, and digital intensity. Linear regression indicates that, expectedly, stronger prevention, detection, and recovery processes are related to lower breach severity and occurrence of investigations or penalties, but contrary to expectations, cybersecurity roles and frameworks are not. Furthermore, better organizational responses are associated with higher breach severity but they are not found to have an impact on the level of investigations, fines, and penalties imposed.

Also, it fills a gap in research concerning the existence of different expectations that trainees may have from the two types of training offerings. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the service quality literature, SERVQUAL’s dimensions were employed to test the six formulated hypotheses. Data were collected from 363 customers of personal training studios in Greece, which have experience in both online and offline training sessions, using the convenience sampling method, both online and offline training sessions. To test the first five hypotheses, regression analysis for both session types was performed, and as for hypothesis 6, the Laplace criterion was used. Findings: Findings indicate that for both online and offline training sessions, Perceived Value was the most important dimension, followed by Assurance, Responsiveness and last Reliability, whereas Empathy was insignificantly related. Also, results revealed a different expectation level between the two service offering methods, where trainees seem to expect more from offline than online sessions. Practical implications: The results indicate that among strong service quality dimensions are variables that are within the reach of management.

This research study comes under three levels, such as data level, information level, and knowledge level. Initially, the data from the CNC machine are collected via a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The collected data are stored in the cloud platform where the unwanted wastes of 7 Muda are removed by using the Value Stream Mapping (VSM 4.0) tool. It is critical in the big data world to have a systematic method for gathering, managing, and analysing data to gain valuable insights from it. Predictive maintenance provides a detailed examination of the detection, location and diagnosis of faults in related types of machinery. Accordingly, Big Data Analytics empowers the lean principle technique of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is suggested for avoiding potential failures to predict maintenance by allowing KPIs to be calculated in real-time. This approach requires high-performance procedures and adaptable manufacturing systems in the current digitalized lean. The information is then processed in the knowledge layer, utilizing the algorithm, rule and lean knowledge bases. The flexibility of manufacturing firms is determined by the adaptability of their shop floor processes. To meet these requirements the article developed pull control techniques of capacity slack CONWIP (CSC) control in digital lean production systems to guide the CPS deployment to offer flexible production systems. Reliable software systems are hoped to facilitate data analysis and autonomous decision-making. Finally, in the decision-making process, the article proposed the Brain-Inspired Computing of Structural and Syntactic (BIC-SS) pattern recognition method. The performance analysis of these findings is simulated in MATLAB software. Simulation can be done with the identification of ideal Kanban parameters like cycle time, lead time, delivery frequency and lot size. Furthermore, lean manufacturing improves company quality and productivity by decreasing waste and production costs, as well as adapting well to the many innovative systems that encourage the culture of change and quality inside organizations.},

We conducted a case study of a large manufacturing company that introduced AGVs and IoT to automate its lean operations. We used socio-technical systems (STSs) design logic to integrate the two distinct domains (lean and automation) into an action plan that successfully meets six lean automation objectives. The findings demonstrate that AGVs implementation should include three phases: design, integration and continuous improvement. The lean automation objectives are: cost, reusability, reliability, simplicity, compactness, fit, engage and culture. The lean automation plan successfully manages the interactions and interplay between social factors (people and culture), technical factors (infrastructure and technology) and operational factors (routines and processes).

The research examined the antecedents to the adoption of mobile tourism shopping (MTS) via an integrated model, consisting of the Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, consumer perception of merchant ethics, consumer decision-making styles, and characteristics of mobile applications. The results were empirically validated via the PLS-SEM-ANN method. The findings indicated that mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use, application quality, and service quality have significant positive correlations with the intention to use MTS, whereas privacy concern has displayed a significant negative relationship. Moreover, source reliability, application reputation, perfectionism, and novelty-fashion consciousness were revealed to be statistically insignificant to the development of adoption intention toward MTS. Furthermore, the ANN results have indicated the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute in the prediction of ANN Model A. The research has generated valuable theoretical implications and practical insights. For one, the advantages that come with the adoption of MTS and the security measures taken by the service providers should be highlighted to the prospects via effective marketing messages to nurture confidence, which can subsequently drive adoption.},

   abstract = {The quantification of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) and grazing intensity (GI) and their distribution in space is of great significance to grassland management and eco-conservation. Remote-sensing technology is widely applied, but it is difficult to measure accurately when monitoring GI. In this study, the neural network, random forest and statistical function models of the relationship between Landsat NDVI and AGB were constructed by field survey and literature data collection in Inner Mongolia grassland, China. By comparing the accuracy among the three models, we constructed a remote-sensing retrieving model of grass AGB. We also estimated the grassland AGB during the peak growing season (August) for Inner Mongolia. Frequency histograms were then made to identify AGB thresholds under four GI levels (light or ungrazed, moderate grazing, overgrazing and extreme grazing) for each of three grassland types (meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe). This study shows that the random forest model simulates grass AGB more accurately than other models. The spatial distribution of AGB in Inner Mongolia grasslands showed a tendency of decreasing from southeast to northwest, with an increasing trend in the last 10 years. The four GI levels in 2021 accounted for 18%, 25%, 36% and 21% of the grasslands in Inner Mongolia, respectively, and over the last 10 years the GI first improved and then deteriorated. This study provides a guideline to remote monitoring for grassland AGB and GI, and supplies scientific support for sustainable management and grassland restoration of large-scale grasslands.},

In 2014, China’s State Council unveiled their ten-year national plan, Made-in-China 2025, which was designed to transform China from the world’s workshop into a world manufacturing power. Made-in-China 2025 is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade China’s industry including the manufacturing sector. In Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025, many applications require a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of Industry 4.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines including cyber-physical Systems, IoT, cloud computing, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Architecture, SOA, Business Process Management, Industrial Information Integration and others. At this present moment, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major obstacle for exploiting the full potential of Industry 4.0. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for realising Industry 4.0, which poses unique challenges.

However, previous studies have overlooked the complementary participation of these two paradoxical leadership behaviours in enterprise management as well as the influence of such complementary participation on employees’ psychological distance (PD). In order to make up for these gaps, this paper uses linear regression analysis, SEM, and ANOVA to explore the influence of AL on ETIP by empirically studying 308 functional department managers in 77 high-tech enterprises in China. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) AL has a significant positive impact on ETIP. (2) The positive impact of AL on ETIP is better than that of single transformational or transactional leadership. (3) PD partially mediates the relationship between AL and ETIP. The finding refines the academic understanding of the relationship between AL, PD, and ETIP, and is enlightening for entrepreneurs to effectively manage their enterprises.},

   abstract = {The emerging paradigm of the modern city demands big data analytics in urban studies. Data mining techniques for big data have the potential to ascertain strategic insights for current and future cities. Clustering is increasingly growing in data mining, serving as a knowledge discovery tool. This article proposes a spatiotemporal clustering method, called spatiotemporal data-adaptive clustering (STDAC), to cope with clustering challenges, such as feature type, parameter setting, and treating spatial and temporal dimensions as equals. The proposed algorithm takes a dual-structure approach to obtain high-quality clusters and discover temporal changes not detected by other techniques. STDAC refers to the feature type and uses k-fold cross-validation (KCV) to replace the user-defined parameters with the data-driven values. The data-driven threshold from KCV performs as the endogenous variable, thus not requiring a priori assumptions or parameter settings. This article used the bus, taxi passengers, and de facto population data as illustrative case studies. The clustering performances were evaluated based on validation indexes, such as the Davies–Bouldin index (DBI) and Dunn index (DI), where STDAC generally had lower DBI and greater DI. The findings showed that STDAC could yield better clustering performances than other established algorithms. Hence, the proposed method would be promising to future studies requiring spatiotemporal big data analytics in urban studies, administrative management, and other fields.},

However, studies focusing on rural Vietnam, where many health issues exist, are still sparse. This current study aimed to investigate the ICT use among rural Vietnamese and examine factors associated with online health information-seeking behaviors. In this cross-sectional study, 226 Vietnamese aged 25 to 70 were recruited from a rural town in Quang Tri Province in 2017. Predictors were selected based on Andersen’s Behavioral Model. Binary logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with online health information-seeking behavior. Results showed that less than half of participants used the Internet, had a smartphone, had a computer or tablet, and used mobile apps. Binary logistic regression results showed that females (OR = .22, CI = .05-.97) and being married (OR = .09, CI = .01-.59) were associated with lower likelihoods to seek health information online. People with annual checkups (OR = 2.89, CI = 1.13–7.41) and more ICT use (OR = 2.58, CI = 1.87–3.57) were more likely to seek health information online. These findings suggested that ICT use and annual checkups were the most important factors in predicting online health information-seeking behavior among rural Vietnamese.

   abstract = {Fatigue failure is one of the most prevalent types of failure in steel structures, which is widely employed in engineering constructions. When a material is exposed to variable loads and strains, fatigue occurs, resulting in failure. A novel prediction technique of fatigue crack growth life of high-strength steel under cyclic compression load is suggested in this study to tackle the problems of significant prediction error and big prediction time cost in the existing prediction of fatigue crack growth life of high-strength steel. The nominal stress approach is used to assess the material’s S-N curve, and the local stress–strain method is used to estimate the fatigue crack development characteristics of high-strength steel under cyclic compression load. The fracture tip stress field of high- strength steel is determined on this premise, based on the compressive stress generated by residual plastic deformation in the crack wake zone of high-strength steel on the crack tip structure. The fatigue crack growth life prediction of high-strength steel under cyclic compression stress has been built, and the fatigue crack growth life prediction study has been accomplished. The experimental findings reveal that the fatigue crack growth life prediction error of high-strength steel samples is minimal, and the prediction speed is fast.},

The aim of this research is to solve large-scale DVRP (LSDVRP) in which the delivery vehicles must serve customer demands from a common depot to minimize transit costs while not exceeding the capacity constraint of each vehicle. In LSDVRP, it is difficult to get an exact solution and the computational time complexity grows exponentially. To find near-optimal answers for this problem, a hierarchical approach consisting of three stages: “clustering, route-construction, route-improvement” is proposed. The major contribution of this paper is dealing with LSDVRP to propose the three-stage algorithm with better results. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology is applicable.},

Narratives show that digitalization is expected to bridge information and knowledge gaps in agriculture; promote food security; increase climate change/environmental sustainability; provide employment and empower the youth; promote gender and women empowerment; and enhance livelihood resilience in rural areas. With these findings, I argue that, though partly justifiable, private-sector led digitalization, with it’s optimistic technocratic narratives, follows, entrenches, and extends the ‘transformational rhetoric’ of the existing international development-driven African Green Revolution efforts to improve smallholder and rural lives through technological diffusion. However, without critical considerations of political-economic issues affecting its proliferation, as well as their implications on power structures and class restructuring, these narratives mask potential neoliberal incursions. Thus, issues of connectivity and the digital divide issues, the slow pace of technological adoption, scaling of digital solutions, and the weak enabling environments must be addressed to potentially make benefits inclusive. The initial suggested political-economic discussions of the narratives inject much needed critical perspectives into the early conversations by showing the potential drivers and motives of digitalization, as well as the tendencies to [among others] further concentrate power and restructure the dynamics of social classes in Africa.},

Socio-scientific issues are social issues related to science. We initiated a specialized training program to develop comics with SSI content for elementary and junior high school teachers to address this. Comics are selected as the media due to their inherent advantages in visual representation and simplification of complex concepts, facilitating easier dissemination in the classroom. Drawing on the TPACK framework and comics theory as the foundation in our interview with teachers, our study primarily focused on identifying challenges and opportunities encountered during training. This investigation reveals two themes of challenges and opportunities in technology and human resources. The findings of this study will serve as a fundamental basis for designing and implementing subsequent training sessions, specifically targeting the areas identified as problematic in the initial stages. By enhancing teachers’ proficiency in developing SSI comics, we seek to promote effective engagement and understanding of socio-scientific issues in educational settings.},

This paper analyses and forecasts the diffusions of four major electronic payment technologies in Nigeria, namely, ATM, PoS, Mobile and Web payments. Diffusion was measured by the volume of financial payments transacted on these technologies. First, we applied two growth models to evaluate the diffusion and to forecast the future trajectories of these payment technologies. Second, we applied the logistics substitution model to evaluate how these technologies compete in the Nigerian payments market. The findings show that like many technological innovations the diffusions of electronic payment technologies are characterised by growth, maturity, saturation, and decline. In addition, the mobile payment system was forecast to emerge as the most diffused payment technology given the volume of financial exchange that will occur on this platform. These findings have implications for innovators, regulators and service providers within the Nigerian payment ecosystems. The findings also have practical implication for achieving the cashless economy and the financial inclusion projects of the Nigerian state which rely on the successful diffusions of these technologies.},

The current paper aims at filling the gaps in measuring management practices and its effects on production costs and technical efficiency using daily data of 92 hospitality firms, i.e. chain hotels, in Norway from 2012 to 2014. We measured management practices in an index constructed from multiple criteria that capture managers' user patterns of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems. The empirical model identified inefficiency using a translog stochastic frontier input distance function (IDF). The findings show, on average, a 10% improvement in management practices increases production costs by 1.2%, but it improves efficiency by 0.9%. However, the marginal effect of improved management practices on the production cost is found to be U-shaped, while the marginal impact on inefficiency gradually declines to zero. The study also provides managerial implications on how to effectively use the ERP system and improve firm performance.},

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in health care services, which led to the increase in adoption of digital health technologies, mostly arising out of need and necessity. Objective: Focusing on the prevailing situations (increasing reliance on digital health services), this study investigates the impact of digital health technologies from the perspectives of policymakers and citizens. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. Twenty-seven semi-structured online interviews were conducted with experts and policymakers for assessing the impact from policymakers' perspectives. An online survey questionnaire instrument was used to collect the responses from 1698 Saudi Arabian citizens in relation to the various aspects of digital health applications. Results: Health care expenditures increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in launch of various digital health applications. While policymakers defended their stand in improving health care services and accessibility; citizens reflected inability to book medi-cines/personal medical equipment online (Mean=2.4) and suffered a lack of personalized care (Mean=2.9) through digital health applications. Moreover, disparities exist between the population groups with respect to the accessibility, utilization, and perceptions of digital health technologies.

Previous studies have shown job satisfaction is positively correlated with work settings, total compensation, and growth opportunities. There is, however, little evidence of job satisfaction in remote working after COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to analyze the job satisfaction in remote working settings (workspace flexibility) among Saudi employees after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic to determine ways to restructure human resource management practices post COVID-19. An online survey (n = 1113) to assess job satisfaction, taking flexibility into account, was conducted among Saudi employees, and the impact of flexibility and remote working policy in various sectors was measured using a Likert scale. The empirical findings demonstrate that periods of remote work are highly valued by employees, predominantly owing to their desire to fulfill personal duties and decrease stress. Interestingly, flexibility scored low among other job satisfaction components owing to two hypothesized reasons. Employees normally receive supervisor approval to combine working from home and the office; hence, they already receive this benefit. The findings of this study provide guidelines for practitioners and HR managers. Human resource management needs to adapt to changing circumstances and challenges, which requires long-term development, adaptation, and updating of human resource policies. This study contributes to literature on human resources by illustrating how managing organizational change can be improved by applying employee flexibility, which was made more pervasive by the worldwide pandemic.},

Farm-specific data are mostly locked in by the first-mover companies. This prevents farmers from switching to a better or cheaper alternative. This also hinders agricultural data-driven innovation due to unanswered access seekers. Moreover, already powerful players build exclusive data exchange clusters that further exclude small rivals and other access seekers. Also, upstream input producers have exclusive control over their products’ performance data, which generates critical advantages for their downstream data-driven services. These conditions endanger the digital agriculture sector and bring about the risk of reflection of the oligopolistic upstream players in this new sector.

To resolve these issues, truck appointment systems are used to schedule appointments of ETs and achieve more balance in CTs’ workload. Most of the studies have focused on deterministic modelling of the ETs’ arrival process with considering yard operations or gate operations. Also, a little effort has been devoted to collaboration between trucking companies and CTs when scheduling ETs’ appointments. Unlike previous studies, this paper presents a simulation-based optimization approach to collaboratively schedule ETs’ appointments with considering yard and gate operations as well as their stochastic natures. The proposed approach integrates a simulation model with an MIP model with objective of minimizing turnaround times of ETs and inconveniences resulting from shifting the arrivals of ETs away from their preferred arrival times. The proposed approach is validated against an approach from literature. In addition, its performance is investigated by solving artificial instances inspired by real data. A framework for implementing the proposed system in the IoT-based container terminals is also developed.},

   abstract = {This study considers how effective South African manufacturing enterprises have used Industry 4.0 tools and applications to achieve sustainability in supply chain operations. Organization Information Processing Theory (OIPT) suggests Industry 4.0 tools should enhance operational capabilities. South African manufacturers were surveyed and 200 responses were received. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the conceptual model. We provide evidence that using Industry 4.0 tools to improve resource consumption rate and reduce waste and pollution is most likely to enhance sustainable supply chain operations. Both the control orientation and the flexible orientation of the production team enhance their ability to generate positive sustainable outcomes from Industry 4.0 use. The results may not be generalizable to other, less developed nations, which struggle with Industry 4.0 implementation but should generalize to other developing nations. This study has a clear implication that there are viable pathways to sustainable supply chain operations, driven by Industry 4.0 applications, through improving resource consumption and reducing waste and pollution.},

This paper provides an empirical examination of firm capabilities that leverage external knowledge, utilising social media for the fuzzy-front-end (FFE) phase of the NPD process. With evidence from 27 interviews conducted with executives’ from large fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms, a thematic analysis using NVivo 12 is used to develop a conceptual framework capturing the key capabilities for using social media in the FFE. The findings reveal that the utilisation of social media is an ongoing process of experimenting with new technologies within the NPD phase of a firm’s innovation efforts. Hence, the results of the study suggest FMCG firms may consider developing the following capabilities to help effectively acquire external knowledge via social media: use staff specialised in social media for external knowledge identification; dedicate an independent department for social media knowledge acquisition; and encourage an open innovation culture.},

First, an archaeological analysis considers the relationship between digital education, lifelong learning and utopia in the political programmes of UNESCO, OECD and the UK government. Second, Levitas’s ‘utopia as ontology’ considers how critical digital education might help move us from the paradigm of the locked-down ‘data subject’ within a human capital model of education toward emergent and more-than-human ways of understanding. Third, the method’s architectural phase is used to explore how a future for digital education might be imagined through the themes of ecopedagogy, diversity of knowledge and the end of institutions. The paper argues that the new twenty-first century utopian imagination might help us to imagine and build better futures for digital education.},

Even though EAM tools and processes have become increasingly mature over the past decade, many organisations still struggle to generate impact from their EAM initiatives. To this end, we describe how enterprise architects at Commerzbank, a major international bank, employed a control mechanism portfolio perspective to more effectively anchor EAM within the organisation. This approach allows to purposefully combine a wide range of different formal and informal EAM control mechanisms, thereby going beyond the formal, top-down driven mechanisms predominantly discussed in EAM literature. Furthermore, such EAM control mechanism portfolios provide an effective means to purposefully realign EAM in reaction to major strategic shifts. The application of this perspective is demonstrated by tracing the evolution of EAM at Commerzbank for more than a decade (2008 to 2018) through a turbulent and challenging competitive environment, resulting in several major strategic realignments that required corresponding adjustments in EAM. We believe that such consciously designed and diversified EAM control mechanism portfolios also provide a useful means for other large organisations to more effectively conduct EAM.},

Debates around smart/intelligent/data mobilities and the IoT–including policy debates–tend to be dominated by motorized modes such as autonomous and networked cars. This article explores the implications of this for more sustainable and active modes such as cycling, both for current policies and for utopian thinking. It draws on literature concerned with utopian thinking, mobilities studies and critical data studies. The methodology combines a content analysis and a visual analysis of the EC policy documents with creating text and images for utopian future versions of these documents. The results show the heavy automotive focus of EC IoT policy documents and suggest an alternative bicycle-focussed IoT utopia. The conclusion facilitates a debate around utopian societies where smart cycling products, infrastructure, policy and funding facilitate sustainable, active and data-responsible mobility at scale. This challenges the current continuation of automobile cultures in smart mobility and IoT policy discourses, and the data and associated power asymmetries between cars and cycling that highlight the significance of this research.},

Yet, while these factors must be included within a comprehensive causal argument, a deeper and more satisfactory explanation for the invasion situates the predicament of the Russian ruling class—and thus government—within the context of the systematic, decades-long project of NATO expansion and a series of specific provocative actions and decisions taken by Kyiv and Washington in the second half of 2021. The United States has consistently opposed integration between Russia and Western Europe. The key parameter of U.S. neo-imperial strategy in Europe-Asia remains embedded in Cold War geo-politics, namely that U.S. hegemony in Eurasia rests on the exclusion of Russia from European affairs and the prevention of a geo-economic axis between Berlin, Moscow and Beijing. However, even as the war may result in a final settling of accounts in the U.S.-Russia relationship and beyond, it has also thrown into increasingly sharp relief the growing conflict of class interests and complex geopolitical asymmetries and contradictions in the transatlantic relationship.},

Aims: We describe the piloting and implementation of telehealth rehabilitation within an adult cochlear implant service. Method: Video conferencing and telehealth tools were assessed in terms of security, accessibility and functionality. Written support materials were developed. Telehealth sessions were piloted with lay volunteers. During service implementation, feedback was collected from patients and staff. Outcomes & results: A video call platform was identified that was supported by the host Trust and also met the rehabilitation service’s needs. A telehealth service was successfully implemented, ensuring continuity of care during lockdown. We share the platform selection framework used, practical lessons learned and patient support materials. Conclusion:.Telehealth rehabilitation facilitated a well-received, effective service for adult cochlear implant patients.

   abstract = {Antitrust cases related to privacy are on the agenda of many competition authorities, including Europe and the United States. Antitrust and privacy is thus “one of the big topics of the year”, as stated by the former President of the French competition authority. While some antitrust cases concern a reduction in privacy protection, others concern an increase in privacy protection. In other words, user privacy can decrease or increase due to alleged anticompetitive practices. An antitrust privacy dilemma? From a law and economics standpoint, the paper solves this dilemma and proposes a new way of resolving antitrust cases related to privacy. Section 2 analyses the dilemma. It proposes an analytical framework. Section 3 proposes a new way of resolving cases. It suggests a coordinated participative approach with competition and non-competition regulators and stakeholders to address competition and privacy concerns with tailored remedies to what is necessary without eliminating pro-privacy effects.},

Interestingly, we have observed that cyberloafing frequently happens when employees use smartphones to assist with work tasks, but they may not necessarily intend to engage in this activity. We distinguish between active and passive cyberloafing and focus on studying the latter. Based on dual-systems theory, we introduce the construct of mindfulness in the exploration of the antecedences and internal mechanism of passive cyberloafing. We conducted a research survey with employees who use smartphones to assist with work tasks and collected 474 valid questionnaires to examine our research model. The results showed that dual systems are associated with cyberloafing by influencing mind-wandering, and mindfulness significantly decreased mind-wandering when using a smartphone. This study analyses cyberloafing from an innovative neuroscience perspective and contributes to the literature by proposing a new classification of cyberloafing behaviour, reveals the internal mechanism of how dual systems impact an individual’s behaviour, and introduces mindfulness as an antecedent factor of dual systems.},

The operations used in area generalization, will cause changes in the geometry and thematic attributes of area features and the topological relationships between them. Very limited quantitative measures, especially for semantics, are available to describe the effect of generalization when multiple objects are involved or when the entire map needs to be characterized. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide some quantitative measures for the changes (especially in semantics) that have occurred during generalization. A set of quantitative measures of data quality, i.e. accuracy, consistency, and completeness, has been developed to assess such effects. The effect of generalization on area features are compared between two approaches, geometry-based merging and theme-based aggregation. An experimental test has also been carried out to illustrate their differences in terms of the proposed quality measures, which demonstrates the practical usefulness of these measures. © The British Cartographic Society 2006.},

However, by means of innovative technological applications and location-based services it is possible to shorten the distance between cultural spaces and their visitors, nowadays determined by the purely aesthetic and essentially passive fruition of cultural objects. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel multipurpose system for creating single smart spaces ((Formula presented.)), a new concept of intelligent environment, that relies on innovative sensors board named smart crickets and an ad hoc proximity strategy; by following the Internet of Things paradigm the proposed system is able to transform a cultural space in a smart cultural environment to enhance the enjoyment and satisfaction of the involved people. To assess the effectiveness of our solution, we have experienced two real case studies, the first one situated within an art exhibition (indoor), and the second one concerning an historical building (outdoor). In this way, technology can become a mediator between visitors and fruition, an instrument of connection between people, objects and spaces to create new social, economic and cultural opportunities.},

At The Washington Post, these teams have been around for three years, and they started to implement tools like election models fueled by A.I. and smart data pipelines that can possibly affect the autonomy and the tasks of the broader newsroom. By applying the process of institutionalization as an analytical framework, this study enhances our understanding of how the interaction takes place between these rather novel engineering teams and the established newsroom. In addition, we get a glimpse if the tools that are being implemented by these engineering teams are taken for granted and what forms of interaction obstruct or drive the way these tools are institutionalized. This study conducted 16 expert interviews focusing on the interaction and the process of institutionalization in combination with digital ethnography where that interaction is observable. Results reveal how the innovation justify–via interaction–the implementation of these tools to the broader newsroom and vice versa. The ways in which the tools are trusted to a minimal group of the newsroom show that the process of institutionalization, for both the teams and the tools, are still in a nascent state. The journalists in the broader newsroom that trust these tools are mostly data savvy and are therefore very homogenous. Transparency is key in order to increase institutionalization across the newsroom for these engineering teams and their tools.},

   abstract = {In competitive markets, such as electronic commerce, evaluations of base-level performance and benchmarking are fundamental for retailers focusing efforts. Hence, we propose a new and practical approach to measuring retailers’ relative performance and benchmarking through a unique index that integrates digital, physical, and financial factors. We investigated 13 traditional retailers controlling 36 marketplaces (i.e., online platforms) in Brazil in 2020. The traffic to the marketplace, the companies’ inventory, capital intensity (physical infrastructure), and gross margin were used in the slacks-based measure and data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, followed by a slacks-based measure super-efficiency model for the sensitivity analysis. Companies’ relative performance is then determined, as well as thei customized targets for achieving efficiency. Three types of marketplaces are explored: pure (direct sales from suppliers to consumers for a fee), reselling (products purchased from suppliers and resold), and hybrid (both options direct and resale, depending on the product). Although data envelopment analysis has already been applied to examine retailers’ performance, there are few extant applications to e-commerce. Our findings show that retailers who operate through specialized (normally reselling) marketplaces tend to be inefficient, and retailers prefer to manage one non-specialized (normally hybrid) marketplace and focus efforts on achieving efficiency instead of managing many marketplaces inefficiently.},

This paper utilises web scraping and text-based models to map the business innovation in Flanders with a focus on identifying different types of innovation through topic modelling. More specifically, the scraped web texts are used to identify innovative economic sectors or topics, and to classify firms into these topics using Top2Vec and Lbl2Vec. We conclude that both models can be successfully combined to discover topics (or sectors) and classify companies into these topics which results in an additional parameter for mapping innovation in different regions.},

However, various studies show that CAVs will solve transport problems under certain conditions only. On the contrary, without respective governance strategies CAVs will (re-)produce and reinforce social and socio-spatial inequalities. Moreover, by reinventing the privately-owned automobile, CAVs could strengthen the societal formation of automobility. Therefore, alternative developments need to be considered, especially those that are not primarily linked to new technologies, but reflect on wider processes of economic, political and cultural transformation. Finally, this leads us to challenge the dominant technocratic approach in the current political debate on the future of mobility.},

This paper presents an original solution for improving the most representative instance of SM, namely, supply chain management (SCM), by using the most recent approach in hierarchical networked control systems (HNCS), that is Edge Computing. The paper presents both the software and hardware architecture of an Edge Gateway device which offers, on one hand, dual communication both on vertical (between the network layers from the local, inferior, represented by IIoT, to the central, superior, represented by the Cloud) and on horizontal (between similar devices located on the same Edge level) and, on the other hand, can locally process data to take fast decisions which facilitate real-time process control. The validity of the proposed solution is supported by a case study performed on a flexible assembly/disassembly line (laboratory model).},

It thus assesses the contribution of foreign direct investment to skill development as well as the potential for spillovers from multinational to domestic firms. It analyzes demand for skilled labor in Slovakia, a country that is characterized by a high degree of dependence on inward foreign investment. Our framework distinguishes between demand for digital skills on two levels: occupational structure; and skill content within occupations. It is on the latter level that the limits of the foreign-led growth can be observed. Using a large dataset on vacancies from a leading job portal, we show that foreign-owned companies generally advertise for higher-skilled occupations than domestic firms, but their skill requirements for these jobs are lower than in similar jobs in domestic companies. Foreign companies have higher skill requirements only in some blue collar jobs linked to assembly and component manufacturing. For white collar occupations, domestic companies are more likely to require digital skills. Domestic firms thus have a key role in skill development also in an economy where foreign companies exhibit higher productivity and innovation intensity.},

This can help to counter digital orientalism by redressing the imbalance in the amount of accessible content online as well as control over the production and circulation of cultural content. An increase in the amount of digitized cultural content can help to engage local audiences and introduce a contemporary image of Vietnamese culture to an international audience. Today, Vietnamese cultural professionals are able to decide what to digitize, what to make publicly accessible and how to curate it online. This paper presents findings from a case study on Manzi Art Space, including a digital ethnography of an augmented reality public art project entitled ‘Into Thin Air’ and 20 interviews with art and cultural professionals working in Hanoi. The findings show how digitization allows cultural professionals to shape the narrative on contemporary Vietnamese art and culture. However, the findings also show there are particular challenges faced by cultural professionals in Hanoi, including lack of human resources, technical resources and funding as well as concerns around copyright law and government permissions. These challenges are hindering the ability to utilize new digital technologies.},

To overcome current challenges, dairy farmers require agile and multi-dimensional innovation, supported by forward-looking and integrated policy from both the sector and government. In this paper, we outline some of the current dairy sector challenges, and potential technologies to address these challenges. We focus on the future for digital agriculture innovation and discuss policy approaches to enable the sector to leverage digitalisation. These approaches include co-innovation, responsible innovation, multi-scale approaches, micro-innovation and poly-innovation and mission-oriented innovation. Digital agriculture and policy may interact in two ways: (1) policy may be used to enhance digital agriculture innovation and, (2) digitalisation itself may act to enhance agricultural policy design and delivery. Overall, innovation policy requires greater directionality, use of policy bundles and a focus on technology as a mediator of new dairy farming practices and institutional configurations.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This study asks: (i) To what extent can VSCs be categorised in terms of their digitalisation application practices and usage perspectives, and (ii) how can the identified categories be described in terms of further organisational characteristics? Methodology: An online survey was conducted among VSCs in Austria and Germany. A hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to create categories of digitalisation. N = 367 VSCs were included in the cluster analysis. Findings: Four categories of digitalisation were identified: “Doubters” (above-average use of digital tools, digitalisation is seen as comparatively risky), “Open Minds” (digitalisation is seen as an opportunity, high need for support), “Pessimists” (digitalisation is seen as comparatively risky), and “High Performers” (above-average use of digital tools, lowest need for support). The categories also differ in terms of organisational goals, the fit of digitalisation to the attitudes of members and the board, and in relation to the organisational culture. Practical implications: The categories can serve as a guideline for which direction digitalisation in the VSC should be developed. Furthermore, the categories provide a classification that could help sports federations more effectively advise their VSCs. Research contribution: The study complements previous findings that focus on single areas of digitalisation application by a multi-perspective analysis of digitalisation.},

The primary data utilized were elicited with the aid of a questionnaire served on the officials of real estate development firms in Nigeria. The obtained data were analyzed using statistical tools such as mean ranking, frequency distribution and principal component analysis (PCA). Based on mean ranking analysis, high cost of implementing BIM (MS = 4.38), cost of hardware installation (MS = 4.24) were found as the most influential inhibiting factors. On further analysis, the results of the PCA revealed that the factors influencing BIM adoption can be grouped into operating environment and regulatory factors, cost of acquisition/usage factors, firm management factors, usage capability factors and client demand factors, with variances of 26.834%, 18.792%, 13.439%, 6.275% and 2.909% respectively. The study concluded that issues surrounding operating environment constraints and cost of acquisition and deployment significantly underpin the uptake of BIM technology in emerging economies like Nigeria. Hence, it is imperative that real estate development organizations embrace industry collaboration and efforts made to reduce BIM acquisition and deployment cost.},

The data are based on two-digit industry-level information on seven European countries for the period 2001–2010. For manufacturing industries, static fixed-effects models show that the share of employees with internet broadband access, the diffusion of mobile internet access and the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and automatic data exchange combined with electronic invoicing are all significantly and positively related to skill intensity in the industries observed. For service industries, only mobile internet usage intensity is significant. Specifically for manufacturing, a 10-point increase in the percentage of firms using ERP systems is associated with an increase in the share of highly skilled workers by 0.4 percentage points. These estimates indicate that the increase in ERP system usage during the period studied accounted for 30% of the increase in the share of workers with a tertiary degree across manufacturing industries and countries. The results are robust with respect to the estimation method and the potential endogeneity of ICT.},

In the context of a political transition, GNova carried out an evaluation process to assess the results of its projects. By using working principles as evaluation criteria, the process was design-led and consisted of two phases. The first was a workshop with project partners, followed by a series of in-depth interviews with participants in six selected projects. The findings were grouped into three types of effects (effects of the process, effects of products and effects of the participation). The evaluation, even though with a limited scope, confirmed the assumption that, in addition to effects from specific products delivered, the lab contributes to the development of competencies in the civil servants who participate in the process, in resonance with a public administration paradigm based on public value.},

The most positive aspects are maintaining the image of the company, the importance of price, and the strategic value that know-how has for businesses. As factors with performance to improve, there are the lack of conventions and agreements with scientific and technical organizations that promote innovation processes and the nonuse of a command board for the strategic and operational management of the business. The flour, dairy, and balanced food complexes were the ones that presented the best strategic management performance.

   abstract = {Several studies have proven a positive impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) on economic growth. Nevertheless, some studies have suggested a limited effect, while others have found no statistically significant effect. Faced with this problem, we conducted a study with the aim to assess the role of moderation of ICT diffusion between financial development and economic expansion in Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 2019. Using the bootstrap approach for the ARDL model, the results prove that financial development as well as ICT diffusion affect negatively (positively) economic development. The financial development interaction term with ICT diffusion has a positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth. The results suggest that ICT diffusion does not only directly impact economic growth but also increase the indirect impact of financial development on economic growth. This result indicates that ICT diffusion boosts the role of financial development in economic development. This means that financial development can only boost the Saudi economy when ICTs are well developed.},

Using semiannual data from 1998 to 2020 and applying the vector autoregression (VAR) model, our results suggest that office vacancy ratios respond positively to economic uncertainty shocks in general, and especially to local economic uncertainty. Moreover, our sub-class analyses show that vacancy ratios in various office spaces respond differently to uncertainty shocks. The office vacancy ratio in premium-grade office responds to both shocks after one year with its responses fading out in year three. B-grade and C-grade vacancy ratios respond to both shocks within the first year and responses last for about 4 years. Additionally, sub-lease vacancy ratios in the aggregate office space show quick responses to uncertainty shocks (dying out in 2 years), while direct vacancy ratios respond after about 1 year (but fading out in 3 years).},

The state responds positively to the agency of people with disabilities in social development and participation by opening opportunities for research grants, start-up funds, publicities and policy lobbying.

To do this, this paper conducts a single case study on DFAB HOUSE, the first project to introduce several fundamentally new DFAB technologies to construct a fully functional building. Using Qualitative Content Analysis, we provide an overview of the challenges to consider and the strategies available to successfully adopt DFAB technologies in construction projects, establishing a socio-technical framework for DFAB adoption in AEC projects. We find that full-scale projects are an effective exploration method of DFAB in AEC, implementation at scale increases acceptance of DFAB in AEC, and projects are instrumental in establishing an emergent praxis of DFAB.},

However, employees are not always motivated to adopt such new technologies. Thus, it is essential to understand the drivers of employees’ attitudes towards new technology at work (e.g. their enthusiasm about new technology or their insecurity or resistance to change). The present study examines (actual and desired) work characteristics as a predictor of attitudes towards new technology in blue-collar work. Results from a correlational study among blue-collar workers (N = 127) showed that work characteristics among blue-collar workers could be divided into three dimensions, namely, work enrichment, work demands, and task identity. These correlated with attitudes towards a to-be-implemented new technology (here, robotic system): As expected, desired work demands correlated with greater technology enthusiasm, whereas a lack of actual work enrichment predicted technology-based job insecurity. Work characteristics were unrelated to user resistance to change. The findings suggest that how workers evaluate their current work, and how much they are (dis)satisfied with it, predicts attitudes towards new technology. This research adds to the knowledge about attitudes towards new technology in blue-collar work. Practical implications for the implementation of technologies in blue-collar work are discussed.},

Meanwhile, the direct impacts of organizational sustainable performance on financial, environmental, and social aspects were supported. Industry 4.0 adoption showed remarkable moderating effects on financial and environmental aspects of sustainable performance. The study provides manufacturers with significant insights into how they need to respond to sustainable development in effective ways. The findings can assist managers and policymakers in setting strategic plans to achieve sustainable performance through industry 4.0 adoption.},

The conceptual model highlights the combined contributions of the Technical KMS representing ICT, and the Sociocultural KMS in facilitating the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic processes of Knowledge Integration, ultimately enhancing Organizational Effectiveness. This cross-sectional survey explores the role of ICT in supporting practitioners within human services organizations as they navigate the complexities of addressing their clients’ diverse needs. The study involves a sample of 1,708 frontline caseworkers who participated in the 2022 Survey of Employee Engagement (SEE). Results demonstrate that both Technological KMS and Sociocultural KMS contribute to enhancing Organizational Effectiveness through improved Knowledge Integration. While caseworkers are more satisfied with Technological KMS, Sociocultural KMS yields greater benefits. Additional analyses comparing the 2008 and current survey data reveal ongoing underwhelming effectiveness despite technological advancements. These findings highlight the importance of integrating advanced technology and business processes, advocating for a paradigm shift toward a knowledge-based and sociotechnical perspective. The potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is discussed, contingent on addressing ethical concerns, cybersecurity, and privacy. Future research should explore the sociotechnical KMS applications and examine their impact on organizational effectiveness.},

   abstract = {Consumers’ dramatic demand has a pernicious effect throughout the supply chain. It exacerbates inventory distortion because of significant revenue loss caused by stock-level issues. Despite the availability of several forecasting techniques, large organisations, manufacturing firms, and e-commerce websites collectively lose around $1.8 trillion annually to inventory distortion. If this problem is solved, sales may increase by 10.3 percent. The businesses are concerned about mitigating this loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in building resilient supply chains. However, developing AI models consumes time and cost. In this paper, we propose a No Code Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) enabling non-technical companies to build machine learning models based on production quantity and inventory replenishment. The development of the NCAI model is fast and inexpensive. However, little research deals with applying NCAI to operations and supply chain problems. Addressing the existing gap, we show the application of NCAI in the retail industry. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Saudi Arabia is currently proceeding with its Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to significantly increase the private sector’s contribution to the country’s gross domestic product. Thus, analyzing private investments at the sectoral level is important for Saudi Arabia. Such an analysis can provide policymakers with a deeper understanding of potential opportunities for boosting private sector growth. This study therefore uses a cointegration and equilibrium correction approach to empirically analyze investments by sector over the period from 1989–2017. We identify a long-run relationship among investments, output and the real interest rate for all sectors except agriculture. Additionally, the real exchange rate has long-run relationships with investments in the agriculture, non-oil manufacturing and other services sectors. This finding implies that sector-specific tailored investment policies are preferable to a one-size-fits-all investment policy.},

   abstract = {The extraction of urban built-up areas is an important aspect of urban planning and understanding the complex drivers and biophysical mechanism of urban climate processes. However, built-up area extraction using Landsat data is a challenging task due to spatio-temporal dynamics and spatially intermixed nature of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) in the cities of the developing countries, particularly in tropics. In the light of advantages and drawbacks of the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Built-up Area Extraction Method (BAEM), a new and simple method i.e. Step-wise Land-class Elimination Approach (SLEA) is proposed for rapid and accurate mapping of urban built-up areas without depending exclusively on the band specific normalized indices, in order to pursue a more generalized approach. It combines the use of a single band layer, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image and another binary image obtained through Logit model. Based on the spectral designation of the satellite image in use, a particular band is chosen for identification of water pixels. The Double-window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) approach is employed for finding the optimum threshold value that segments the selected band image into water and non-water categories. The water pixels are then eliminated from the original image. The vegetation pixels are similarly identified using the NDVI image and eliminated. The residual pixels left after elimination of water and vegetation categories belong either to the built-up areas or to bare land categories. Logit model is used for separation of the built-up areas from bare lands. The effectiveness of this method was tested through the mapping of built-up areas of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India from Thematic Mapper (TM) images of 2000, 2005 and 2010, and Operational Land Imager (OLI) image of 2015. Results of the proposed SLEA were 95.33% accurate on the whole, while those derived by the NDBI and BAEM approaches returned an overall accuracy of 83.67% and 89.33%, respectively. Comparisons of the results obtained using this method with those obtained from NDBI and BAEM approaches demonstrate that the proposed approach is quite reliable. The SLEA generates new patterns of evidence and hypotheses for built-up areas extraction research, providing an integral link with statistical science and encouraging trans-disciplinary collaborations to build robust knowledge and problem solving capacity in urban areas. It also brings landscape architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape and ecological engineering, and other practice-oriented fields to bear together in processes for identifying problems and analyzing, synthesizng, and evaluating desirable alternatives for urban change. This method produced very accurate results in a more efficient manner compared to the earlier built-up area extraction approaches for the landscape and urban planning.},

The psychological impact of this pandemic is an undeniable stressor greatly affecting employee well-being across cultures. Social media, in such a time of crisis, can provide the requisite support by filling the emotional, informational and instrumental voids. In order to explain how reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic influences an individual’s employee well-being, this study first examines the relationships between pandemic reactions, social media engagement and employee well-being, and then develops a completely mediated model by fully integrating these links. The results, of structural equation modelling analyses conducted for 304 employees from Hospitality (129) and IT/ITeS sector (175) in India, offered strong support for the proposed model. We found that pandemic reactions were indirectly and positively associated with employee well-being; mediated by social media engagement. This study theoretically contributes to the employee well-being literature by revealing how social media engagement completely mediates the relationship between pandemic reactions and employee well-being. The study also offers practical implications by stressing the significant role played by social media engagement in influencing employee well-being in these testing times.},

This study deepens understanding of the forces affecting the real estate market environments of Shrinking Cities by examining the public discourse and the perceptions of local market participants, both of which steer future market development. To identify and analyse these forces, an environmental scanning method was employed, using as data sources 872 Finnish newspaper articles and 45 interviews with market actors in eight Shrinking Cities in Finland. The results categorise the identified forces under three themes that describe the drivers of future market development. The findings indicate that, although the Real Estate markets of Shrinking Cities face challenges, forces such as telecommuting, multi-local living and emerging industries may offer new opportunities and slow urban shrinkage.

For too long, the image of nursing has been formed by television and movies, which typically portray the nurse as the doctor’s assistant or as a background character rather than an integral member of the interdisciplinary team. Method: “The New Script of Nursing”, using a multi-media digital approach, was launched by Johns Hopkins University to break through the stereotypical images of nursing and showcase the depth and breadth of the nursing profession. Using a case study method, using temporal limits, the method of the campaign is described and the impact assessed using digital analytics. Results: Within two weeks there were: 23,030 views on Facebook including 1467 reactions, comments and shares; Twitter received 12,208 impressions and 832 engagements; YouTube received 4518 views and 107 views on Instagram. The We Got This website received more than 7000 visitors from Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Portugal, Lebanon, and Hong Kong. Engagement has been sustained and within nine months, the video on social media received 32,000 views and 400 shares. Conclusion: Social media, cellphones, and portable devices enable not just rapid but widespread communication and there is a compelling imperative to engage this media.

However, several challenges influence the adoption of sustainability and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study aimed (i) to identify the adoption barriers of sustainability and I4.0 and (ii) to establish the interrelationship among these barriers for SMEs. An extensive literature search supported by interviews with supply chain practitioners from three SMEs identified 12 critical barriers to adoption. The barriers are then ranked using ‘Interpretive Structural Modeling’. The results suggest that the ‘lack of resources’ and the ‘lack of employee’s competence/expertise’ are the most influencing barriers. Changing government regulations on the allocation of capital and financial incentives for SMEs to encourage training and skills development programs could promote sustainable supply chains and practices. The study also reflects short-, medium- and long-term planning strategies for supply chain practitioners for adoption of sustainability and I4.0 in SMEs.},

Despite all of the challenges and problems caused by the pandemic, it has encouraged the development of a new digital landscape, through the services of which each museum will be able to expand its reputation and maintain and strengthen contact with its visitors, developing meaningful dialog and communication with them. To capture the reactions of Greek museums towards the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, the present quantitative research aims to examine issues of digital presence in social media, as well as their management practices. The study partly reveals the museums’ efforts to modernize, but it also demonstrates their inability to listen to and implement the standard practices of international institutions.},

In recent years, considerable attention from both practitioners and academics has been focused on evaluating the impacts of innovative technologies adoption. However, the current body of literature on technology adoption, implementation and evaluation in logistics is quite fragmented; thus, an updated and structured overview of the scientific literature in this field might be useful. To this end, this work presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that aims to increase the understanding of the trend toward new technologies in logistics and identify the main research trends and gaps. The principal research trends that emerged from the SLR involve the technologies, their evolution over time and their relationships with the research methodologies. The main literature gaps concern integration and communication, technology-adoption processes and differences between inbound and outbound logistics.},

Therefore, this study investigates whether a firm’s innovation increases not only as R&D collaboration partners’ diversity increases but also as firms engage in cross-sectoral R&D collaboration. Government subsidies for ICT firms that collaborate with other firms and research institutions at the same time have significantly positive effects on firm performance. Interestingly, cross-sectoral collaborations increase innovation activity. The results suggest that firm innovation can be efficiently achieved through R&D partner diversity, and the R&D subsidy scheme needs to focus on collaboration with diverse R&D partners with different knowledge to generate innovative outcomes.},

Second, a set of hypotheses were derived from the research mode and a questionnaire was deployed to collect data in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Data analysis was performed by using the AMOS modeling method based on a total of 373 valid surveys. Findings show a positive linear chain relationship between block chain, supply chain’s collaborative innovation capability, and supply chain’s CPI performance. Moreover, block chain capability is diffused into CPI capability for indirectly promoting the supply chain’s CPI performance. This study can put forward theoretical guidelines for manufacturing enterprises to grasp the strategic significance of block chain in product innovation activities.},

However, corporate learning is a slow process, so outsourcing manufacturing can override the long-term benefits of accumulating productivity knowledge. Semiconductor industry is also strongly featured by the learning effect, however, due to high capital requirements of building fabs, there are companies that fully outsource, while others try to keep production in-house. The chosen business model now gets further importance due to bottlenecks and supply issues perceived in the industry since the COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, we model the make-or-buy decision problem of a firm that decides on the optimal mix of outsourcing and in-house production, considering productivity gain via learning-by-doing and the economic impact of resilience. By presenting numerical simulations, we aim to capture the pre-pandemic and the current state of the semiconductor industry. Our model highlights that tendencies of being fabless were reasonable in the past. Although recent industry conditions have made in-house production more beneficial, this optimal strategy may be fragile due to changes of relative production costs or the extent of economic impact of chip shortages, which may underline the relevance of government incentives aiming to revitalise semiconductor industry.},

A search of the literature reveals 70 articles using different methodological approaches over the period 2006–2016. The descriptors for the search were ICTs, information systems, technological systems, social work and e-social work. The main findings are that most studies on ICTs and social work focus on the impact, potential and specific uses of technologies in different aspects of social work, the ethical issues involved and the special attention that should be given to social workers’ educational programmes. This scenario is a changing reality that must be taken into account: it is an irrefutable fact that new technologies are affecting social work and will be reflected by researchers and practitioners who should address and deal with these new trends in social work. The results allow us to identify four key recommendations to assist social workers in successfully adopting and implementing ICTs in their daily practice.},

The scientific approach of this paper is twofold: it is based on an extensive literature review focused on articles related to packaging science and on a set of empirical observations from industrial cases of enhanced packaging with a higher emphasis on interactive packaging. The key findings of this paper are the two principal purposes of smart interactive packaging: (1) to enhance the product’s functionality or experience in order to serve its primary initial purpose more effectively and (2) to improve consumers’ experiences through engagement and entertainment in both the retail and the usage environment. This paper proves its originality by considering shifts in technological opportunities in packaging to assure a broader range of design options in packaging and engagement, thereby leaving packaging as static item. Also, bridging the general consumer experience between digital marketing and physical shopping using packaging is a novelty in retailing and brand management. This research is in its early stages and limitations are given from the modest proliferation of smart and interactive packaging into empirical contexts. New technologies of packaging and the design decisions are expected to have significant practical implications for brand and retail managers as well as consumers.},

Our results show that online search intensity between the two countries can significantly promote international trade. This finding is robust to a wide range of tests, including instrumental variable estimation, different specifications and different estimators. Mechanism analysis shows that online search is likely to increase trade by overcoming unfamiliarity and reducing trade risks. Since the role of online search is similar to that of traditional networks, we further conduct extended analysis and find that online search is likely to substitute, rather than complement, migration networks in international trade. Since many traditional networks are broken due to the pandemic, online search is promising to become increasingly important in the future.},

However, recent findings highlight the aim to avoid trade-offs between innovation and efficiency through organisational ambidexterity. This paper reports a case study of ambidextrous IT Governance in two large government agencies. According to the findings, ambidextrous IT Governance is enacted through two separate but interrelated mechanisms that emerge simultaneously. In terms of exploitation, the “efficiency creep” mechanism creates a bias for efficiency–rather than innovation-oriented investments. In terms of exploration, the “shadow innovation” mechanism involves unsanctioned innovation activities. These two mechanisms interplay, in the enactment of ambidextrous IT Governance. The contribution of this study lies in theorising about how ambidextrous IT Governance is enacted in public sector organisations, and how efficiency creep and shadow innovation influence each other. This contribution aids future research and practice on public sector innovation and IT Governance.},

Born out of the need to prioritise work given budget cuts, the risk scores alleviate fears of missing opportunities for prevention and render professional decision-making defendable. Rather than replacing professional judgement, the article finds that officers maintain discretion in a process of co-construction by scrutinising the risk scores and weighing them against other priorities and operational constraints. In a climate of austerity, a concern arises from the scores’ potential to drive short-term selective incapacitation rather than prevention through supportive measures.},

   abstract = {Despite the fact that social networking sites (SNSs) provide new opportunities for firms and brands, there is still a little understanding of how user-generated contents (UGC) and shopping-related research via Facebook (FB) affects brand loyalty intention in the luxury fashion context. The present work develops a conceptual model to empirically analyze how brand loyalty intention is affected by customers’ trust in a brand’s FB page, by their willingness to utilize brand’s FB page for shopping-related searches, and by three different types of UGC: peer recommendations, informational support and emotional support. In order to fulfill this aim, the study examines 277 Millennials and the Victoria’s Secret FB page. Structural equation model results reveal that online shopping-related searches, peer recommendations and social support have significant positive effects on customers’ trust. Moreover, the research points out a significant positive effect between customers’ trust and their brand loyalty intention, supporting marketers to better understand the role played by trusted UGC. The research provides interesting insights, for both academic and practitioners, because it contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the field of brand and social media marketing. Moreover, UGC, especially informational support, could enable firms to influence consumers’ behavior positively and to transform their brands’ FB pages into trusted ones.},

While the European Union is not a state, it has not been immune to these processes. Over the last three decades it has expanded its Single European Market and created a currency while constructing European political authority and deepening its institutional capacities. The EU has done this through supranational market-making largely centred on neoliberal precepts of competition and openness. Today, however, the EU is breaking with that tradition by pursuing a visibly interventionist European industrial policy and geopolitical market strategy. I suggest a theoretical framework to illuminate how this policy turn may reconfigure the EU’s political authority and build it as a polity. After briefly identifying the contours of the new European industrial and geoeconomic policy, I outline a research agenda to probe how the new market activism may reformulate societal interests and coalitions, increase the politicisation of the EU’s governing institutions, raise the stakes for democratic legitimation, and project the EU as a geopolitical actor. The conclusion notes how this new market-making translates into significant policy challenges for both the EU and the international economic order.},

Taking the market-oriented media outlet Caixin as a case, this study explores how Chinese journalists articulate their professional roles, values and ideals in the coverage of COVID-19. Through discourse analysis, we find that Caixin has defended its authority and legitimacy as quality journalism by incorporating “self-reflexivity” and “transparency” in their professional practices in the digital age. In response to the global journalism crisis, while Chinese state media have adopted the Marxist view, positivity and “conditioned autonomy” to counter the Western “professionalism”, market-oriented media represented by Caixin have turned inward to “reflexivity” and “transparency” as a compromising strategy in their professional conventions.},

Our research will notably examine the expressed capacity of the local actors in Serbia and their main drivers to accept and support China’s initiatives. A new chapter in cooperation with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) resulted from the one-sided PRC initiative. Vulnerable to the consequences of the global economic crises and neglected by Brussels, member states among the “sixteen” were attracted to China’s promise of market access for their products and investment. The Balkan states, severely affected by the civil war in the 1990s and the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, were in an even grimmer condition and even further from substantial developmental assistance from Brussels. The domestic economic and somewhat political drivers were the main ones that existed with all the local agents and their willingness to engage. In the case of Serbia, there were also powerful peace and security issues. Additional drivers come from international relations, and major power rivalries became increasingly apparent with the rise of project numbers and values and China’s growing political clout over the included countries.},

To benefit from the potential of this technical innovation and ensure optimal patient care, future physicians should be equipped with the appropriate skills. Accordingly, a suitable place for the management and adaptation of digital assistance systems must be found in the medical education curriculum. To determine the existing levels of knowledge of medical students about AI chatbots in particular in the healthcare setting, this study surveyed medical students of the University of Luebeck and the University Hospital of Tuebingen. Using standardized quantitative questionnaires and qualitative analysis of group discussions, the attitudes of medical students toward AI and chatbots in medicine were investigated. From this, relevant requirements for the future integration of AI into the medical curriculum could be identified. The aim was to establish a basic understanding of the opportunities, limitations, and risks, as well as potential areas of application of the technology. The participants (N = 12) were able to develop an understanding of how AI and chatbots will affect their future daily work. Although basic attitudes toward the use of AI were positive, the students also expressed concerns. There were high levels of agreement regarding the use of AI in administrative settings (83.3%) and research with health-related data (91.7%). However, participants expressed concerns that data protection may be insufficiently guaranteed (33.3%) and that they might be increasingly monitored at work in the future (58.3%). The evaluations indicated that future physicians want to engage more intensively with AI in medicine. In view of future developments, AI and data competencies should be taught in a structured way during the medical curriculum and integrated into curricular teaching.},

This article aims to examine this assumption based on the analysis of the heritage digitalisation strategies of Doha and Singapore. These cities have made significant investments in heritage preservation and digital technologies, positioning themselves as smart, creative, and culturally diverse urban centres. At the core of these strategies are transmedia heritage districts, which, despite having limited physical remnants of the past, revive their heritage across a range of online and offline channels. Based on an analysis of policy documents and on fieldwork in these cities, this article raises questions regarding the transformative power of the digital and its ability to democratise and pluralise the heritage discourse. I argue that while heritage digitalisation can function as a tool to showcase openness, strategically empower co-opted civic dynamics, it can also reinforce the prevailing heritage narrative. The transmedia heritage district serves as a policy instrument that displays the civic potential of digital heritage technologies in order to enable urban transformation and incorporate selected minority voices into the authorised heritage discourse.},

First, it explicated each effect of the four main components of digital literacy such as technical skills, information usage, communication and creation. A nationwide survey of more than 2,500 South Korean students showed that all components but technical skills were significant predictors of various activities of engagement. Information usage was the most salient predictor of posting on social issues and donation, while creation was highly related to volunteering. Next, we tested if there were any salient differences among the low, medium and high-news attention groups. Digital literacy components were significantly related to engagement among high-news attention respondents. In the low-attention group, however, the variables rarely predicted participation. The differences among groups were coherent across various engagement variables. This study demonstrates that frequency and amount of time spent on social media does not automatically guarantee adolescents’ civic engagement. Competence and attitude under the broader umbrella of digital literacy are what really matter. The normative and practical implication for digital literacy education and the function of news regarding the connection between digital literacy and engagement were further discussed.},

Online teaching has suddenly become the main form of medical education, a form that may be used as long as the pandemic continues. We aimed at analyzing how online teaching was perceived by both teachers and learners to help determine how to adapt curricula in the next few years. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of medical students, pediatric residents, neonatal fellows, and their respective teachers was conducted between June and August 2020 to assess feelings about quality, attendance, equivalence, and sustainability of online teaching programs. 146 Students and 26 teachers completed the survey. 89% of students agreed that the offered online teaching was an appropriate way of teaching during the pandemic. Less than half of learners and teachers felt they have received or provided a training of an equivalent level and quality as in usual courses. About one-third thought that this online teaching should continue after the crisis ends. Medical school students had significantly more mixed opinions on online teaching than residents and fellows did. Attendance of learners significantly improved with synchronous online classes (p < 0.001), and among more advanced learners (p < 0.002). Our study is the first of this kind to assess simultaneously the feelings of learners at different levels (medical students, residents, and fellows) and their respective teachers of pediatric on programs taught online.

Conversely, older words continually fall out of use as they decrease in cultural significance.

Social networking sites such as Facebook and WhatsApp, and email have attracted millions of African language-speaking users who connect and communicate via the internet, using both computers and mobile devices. This has largely expanded on various languages’ vocabularies. For instance, ‘Apple’ and ‘Blackberry’ are no longer just fruits, they now also belong to the social media register. The lexical system of African languages as it is represented in the social networking sites has been neglected as a field of study. Hence, the pertinence of this study which explores social networking neologisms across African languages, with a distinct focus on Tshivenḓa as one of the 12 official languages in South Africa. The study takes a morpho-semantic approach, while Newmark’s model of neologism typology is used as a theoretical point of departure. The design and methodology of the study is qualitative descriptive, which employs purposive sampling. Data analysis involved word classification according to their formation processes and analysis to reveal their meanings, word class and word formation type. The findings highlight that borrowed lexical items with new senses are the dominant type of neologism found in the interface and translation procedures of neologisms from English to Tshivenḓa. This is dominated by the application of transference and couplets. The study has implications for linguists, language practitioners, lexicographers and researchers.},

Data were gathered from a survey and analyzed via the dual-stage Structural Equation Modeling-Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) technique to capture both linear and non-linear relationships. The findings suggested that information value, monetary value, self-congruence, and reward and recognition drive hedonic and/or utilitarian motivations, which in turn promote users’ satisfaction and commitment toward mobile payment services. The ANN analysis reveals the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute. The research provides theoretical insights and practical implications for the field of mobile payment services.},

   abstract = {This article explores the aftermath of job loss in journalism in 2012, a year of dramatic press industry restructuring in Australia. It reports the findings of a pilot survey of 95 Australian redundant journalists, undertaken as part of the New Beats project, a five-year, university-industry investigation of what happens to journalists, and journalism, after job loss. Three related questions drive the analysis: Where do journalists go after job cuts? How do they make sense of job loss? What happens to professional identity? In contrast to a recent study of journalists laid off from the British press, and the literature on the aftermath of job loss for older professionals, this research finds that, in practical terms, the Australian journalists had relatively better than expected post-job loss experiences. All but two of the redundant journalists seeking re-employment found some form of work within one year, and, thanks to union-enforced redundancy agreements, most left newsrooms with severance payments that cushioned the financial impact of unemployment. Yet, the majority did not resume their full-time careers in journalism, and many were emotionally traumatised not only by job loss but also career change. The article argues a sense of leaving a newspaper industry in seemingly terminal decline amplified feelings of anger and anxiety about both the future of journalism work, and lost professional identity, prompting many to leave the profession intentionally and seek jobs elsewhere.},

   abstract = {Chatbots are an emerging technology that is disrupting the tourism industry. Despite their implementation in companies and at destinations, there is little research that evaluates chatbots’ smart tourism technologies (STTs) attributes and their influence on tourist satisfaction. This study seeks to examine the relationship between informativeness, empathy, accessibility, interactivity and chatbot user satisfaction. The research was based on an experiment and a survey conducted on a sample of 468 potential tourists who used a chatbot during their trip. Statistical tools such as exploratory factor analysis and the hierarchical regression method were used in the data analysis. The results suggest that informativeness, empathy and interactivity of destination chatbots are the attributes that influence and predict tourist satisfaction while accessibility does not. The main contribution of this study is the analysis of the attributes of STTs applied to destination chatbots, which also provides valuable information for both tourism chatbot developers and smart destination managers who wish to adopt this technology. Highlights: The communication with a chatbot resembles the dialogues they have with human agents. Informativeness is a predictor factor in users’ satisfaction with chatbot The empathic ability of the chatbot is a factor that predicts user satisfaction A high level of interactivity in a human-chabot interaction predicts user satisfaction.},

We provide an overview of plastic waste trade to African countries and an assessment of existing digital solutions that can support the transition to a circular plastic economy. The findings show that various digital innovations are being applied by entrepreneurs including web-based solutions, mobile apps and 3D printing. The case studies also show that multinational companies, especially consumer facing brands, are major players in the national plastic value chains in African countries, acting as seed funders for start-ups as well as buyers of recycled plastics. Current initiatives that are underway are positive signs that changes are in progress to address the environmental and social impacts of plastics value chains in Africa. However, to achieve a transition to sustainable circular value chains, changes at policy level will be required to enable scaling-up of local start-up businesses, address regulatory barriers to digital solutions, create markets for recycled plastic materials and implement extended producer responsibility regulations.},

As the topic has not been reviewed before in Textile Progress, the paper follows the process of fashion product development, a key task that forms one of the many responsibilities of fashion buyers and merchandisers and explores the literature from its origins to the present day, capturing the significant elements that have changed and shaped the process over time. Establishing the challenges and changes in contemporary fashion retailing enables the development of an understanding of how and why these fundamental factors impact not only the process of getting products from idea to concept, but also the roles and responsibilities of the buyers and merchandisers; added to this, the review provides a critical overview of the Buying Cycle. The review further explores the external and internal components and participants influencing the fashion product development process, thereby updating what can be found in the existing product development literature to reflect the current state-of-play in the industry. By illustrating and reviewing the process models of new product development and fashion product development from their original and early forms to the present day, the review establishes the links, connections, and differences across both the more-general and specific areas of research. Subsequently, there is a review of the roles and responsibilities of the fashion buyer and merchandiser, alongside a discussion of how the developments, advancements and transformation of the industry have changed the nature of the involvement of these crucial personnel in the fashion product development process over time. This aspect of the review provides a base upon which to analyse the contemporary fashion-retail buying cycle, establishing its early connection to organisational decision-making process models and the implications and challenges that product assortment planning, development, and retailing pose on the cycle. The last two chapters of this review are dedicated to two crucial areas of the contemporary fashion industry, namely sustainability and technology and address how they have become key drivers in determining the roles of the fashion buyer and merchandiser and how the fashion product development process is now addressed.},

Initially considered a short-term situation, working remotely remains the norm for many. While many organizations are keen for the workforce to return to the office, others consider the benefits of remote, or hybrid, working. With remote working becoming the ‘new normal’ it is vital to consider its impact on employee engagement and the role of HRD in ensuring employees and managers have the skills, knowledge and abilities to engage with the organization, teams and each other. The constant threat of future variants (and other economic and political pressures) means we must learn from our experiences and embed these lessons. We explore these unprecedented changes in employee engagement through an informed discussion by reviewing academic and practitioner literature. Consequently, we offer three propositions reflective of the pandemic and ‘enforced’ remote working. First, include employees in discussions about the organization’s future purpose, with a renewed focus on skills realigned to enhance resilience. Secondly, toffer customized practices that focus on flexibility and inclusivity. Finally, increase employees' autonomy to allow accountablity for their engagement.},

   abstract = {The story of statistics in geotechnical engineering can be traced to Lumb’s classical Canadian Geotechnical Journal paper on “The Variability of Natural Soils” published in 1966. In parallel, the story of risk management in geotechnical engineering has progressed from design by prescriptive measures that do not require site-specific data, to more refined estimation of site-specific response using limited data from site investigation as inputs to physical models, to quantitative risk assessment (QRA) requiring considerable data at regional/national scales. In an era where data is recognised as the “new oil”, it makes sense for us to lean towards decision making strategies that are more responsive to data, particularly if we have zettabytes coming our way. In fact, we already have a lot of data, but the vast majority is shelved after a project is completed (“dark data”). It does not make sense to reduce one zettabyte to a few bytes describing a single cautious value. It does not make sense to expect big data to be precise and to fit a particular favourite physical model as demanded by the classical deterministic world view. This paper advocates the position that there is value in data of any kind (good or not so good quality, or right or wrong fit to a physical model) and the challenge is for the new generation of researchers to uncover this value by hearing what data have to say for themselves, be it using probabilistic, machine learning, or other data-driven methods including those informed by physics and human experience, and to re-imagine the role of the geotechnical engineer in an immersive environment likely to be imbued by machine intelligence.},

   abstract = {Data breaches and cyber incidents are on the rise, and companies continually research new technologies to defend against attacks and protect customer data. The blockchain is a data store designed to promote data privacy, as well as transaction integrity. Enterprises in several industries, especially banking, have investigated the implementation of blockchain-based databases to replace centralised databases as one mechanism for protecting customers’ data by separating transactional data from personally identifiable information. Despite the blockchain’s privacy protections, consumers remain largely unaware of these benefits. Building on the Health Belief Model (HBM), we include privacy concerns and inertia as critical factors that influence consumers’ perceptions of blockchain-based databases’ benefits. Using a sample of 304 respondents, we test a theoretical model incorporating these factors. Our study results indicate threat severity, threat susceptibility, awareness, and inertia significantly influence the perceived benefits of blockchain, which has a significant positive influence on consumers’ intention to switch to blockchain-based applications. Although consumers’ comfort with the status quo of traditional banking mechanisms is a significant barrier to the realisation of blockchain banking applications benefits, additional awareness of consumer privacy protections can persuade customers to use the blockchain-based applications, especially if they exhibit heightened privacy concerns.},

Innovative learning cultures have the potential to accommodate industry’s skills expectations with workers need for new forms of workplace learning. This study explores the role of learning cultures as (1) moderators between stability and change, (2) indicators for promoting resilience in VET, and (3) generators for new ideas and innovative approaches in VET. In probing how 26 actors involved in workplace learning negotiate new expectations and changes at their workplace, we arrive at a process model of resilience in workplace training that describes several steps of a perpetual process: Individuals need to perceive a change or new situation as such and then classify it as a form of disturbance. This is followed by a process of negotiation in which certain aspects of the change are tested and adopted. This can lead to rejection and exit or to a phase of normalisation where interpretations, adaptations, and internalisations take place. Finally, we argue that the role of new learning cultures is to ensure that new ideas and training concepts are eventually enacted constructively and beneficially by all actors involved in workplace training.},

This study used a set of computer analysis methods including Dirichlet-multinomial regression Topic Model and Topic network analysis. News articles from 2000 to 2019 were collected from East Asia and North America and were analysed on the topic of start-ups. The results indicated that the discourse of start-ups from East Asia and North America in the 2000s and 2010s showed distinctly different trends. The East Asia media changed its focus from an innovation economy to an emerging industry: mobility & energy, while the North American media showed a change from revenue sources to the benefit of innovation. In the discourse of start-ups in East Asia, the government-centred innovative economy was emphasised in the 2000s, and expectations for emerging industries such as mobility and energy increased after the 2010s. Meanwhile, in the discourse of start-ups in North America, revenue sources were emphasised in the 2000s, and the proportion of beneficiaries of innovation increased after the 2010s.},

How do ethnic Chinese businesses and their associations respond to the BRI, and by extension, a rising China? How do transnationalism and the nation-states shape their engagement strategies? What are the implications of the Southeast Asian experience for an understanding of diaspora transnationalism? Drawn upon empirical studies conducted in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, and by examining the emergence of the new structural characteristics of Chinese business associations, we argue that these associations have formed institutionalised transnational interactions with China through a variety of mechanisms to facilitate cross-border flows of capital, goods, people, and information. Resultant from various policies instituted by the Southeast Asian states, this economic transnationalism has not led to the dilution of the national identity and political loyalty of ethnic Chinese towards their respective countries. We conclude that the institutionalised transnationalism has operated within a ‘dual embeddedness’ structure in which the state is involved as a key network node in the transnational socio-economic field connecting China and the region.},

Yet the literature does not define the term precisely and has not described implications in terms of making news. Furthermore, we know almost nothing about how journalists themselves understand this jargon and how they view what it entails in terms of the (changes to) underlying practices. This research analyzed the production systems of three different types of French-language Swiss newspapers that label their production systems digital first: a local paper, a legacy paper and a metro-style paper. It interviewed 17 of their newsworkers, 15 of which described the way their newspaper makes news as digital first without being prompted. The full range of properties attributed to digital first emerging from the data reflected five dimensions: temporality, content format, workflow, production mindset and business strategy. These five dimensions were conceptualized by building a digital first matrix, thereby contributing to definitional clarity, while also serving as a useful tool to analyze newspaper production. In practice, production and editing resources seem to determine a newspaper's success in fully implementing more ambitious visions of digital first. Digital first, we argue, constitutes an emerging newsmaking paradigm.},

There is useful spatial information in social survey data that is sometimes analyzed for spatial patterns despite potential biases. This article explores whether risk perception and adaptive behavior can be inferred from census and hazard exposure data with a specifically designed survey. An underlying question is what precautions surveys should take before mapping the results. We find that a hybrid multilevel regression and (synthetic) poststratification (MRP-MRSP) model can facilitate the transition from individual survey data to small-area estimations at different scales, including 200-m grid cells. We demonstrate this model using municipal-level survey data collected in the Paris region, France. We find that model accuracy is not decreased at finer scales provided there is a strong spatial predictor such as hazard exposure. Our findings show that a wide range of flood risk perception and evacuation behavior can be estimated with such downscaling techniques. Although this type of modeling is not yet commonly used among geographers, our study suggests that it can improve mapping of survey results and, in particular, can provide spatially explicit behavioral information for risk assessment and policy.},

The interactions of organizational ecosystems result in ecological values for extracting ideas and demands from clients and other members of the network. Therefore, different views can be stored, categorized, and analyzed. Instead of eliminating rivals, corporations replace mere competition with cooperation and competition (coopetition); thus, the customer will be regarded as a resource for creating collaborative ideas and products instead of the means to make a further profit.

This progression might pave their ways in attaining the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs). Developing a green financing channel for funding is necessary for the sustenance of these projects. However, the potential impact of this project financing mechanism is conditional on the social balance in the economic system. Gender inequality being a major social issue in the OECD countries, it might pose a predicament in attaining the full potential of the green financing of eco-innovations. It is anticipated that the eco-innovation endeavors in the OECD countries are not gender-inclusive, and hence, gender inequality might limit the cognitive aptitude of these endeavors. The present study intends to assess the moderating role of gender inequality on the impact of green financing of eco-innovations for the OECD countries. Using the dynamic elasticity modeling approach, the study finds that the presence of gender inequality dampens the potential of green financing mechanisms to boost eco-innovations. The social imbalance caused by gender inequality also weakens the impacts of the structural and institutional environment to foster innovations.

Using a two-level model with objective sales data from 626 salespeople working in 68 organizational units, they empirically assess its effects in relation to analogous formal controls, that is, formal methods implemented by the organization to also evaluate and reward salespeople’s sales output. Further, the study explores contingencies—specifically the role of transformational leadership and the size of the organizational unit—in determining the efficacy of said organizational climate. Results show that an informal sales climate, as an informal control, does indeed make a unique contribution toward increasing salespeople’s sales output, above and beyond the impact of formal controls. The two control mechanisms, however, do not interact with each other. Transformational leadership greatly enhances the positive effect of an informal sales climate, as does the size of the organizational unit. In demonstrating the importance of this organizational climate, the study justifies measuring it and provides a scale that can be used for this purpose.},

In the last decade, the latter is undergoing a democratic decay. The currently dominant Islamic Populism is reinterpreting fundamental concepts of constitutional democracy to entrench a paternalistic majoritarian vision of the law-making process and of the society. This perspective undermines the principle of gender equality, confirming the denial of LGBTQIA+ rights and increasingly favouring the principle's interpretation in line with the Islamic conception of gender complementarity. Such a limitation in women's enjoyment of equality is quite striking for a country that started the process of women's emancipation and empowerment at the beginning of the twentieth century, coevally with the establishment of the Turkish Republic. Furthermore, this drift raises doubts as to the activity of the parliamentary committee on ‘Equal opportunity for women and men’, established in 2009 with the duty of ensuring the respect for gender equality throughout the law-making process. Does it effectively enhance gender equality in the legislation or is it a mere reputational tool? To answer this question, after having introduced the illiberal features of the current Turkish regime, the activity of the Committee is assessed against the European and Turkish standards on the quality of legislation. Finally, concluding remarks compare the Turkish case with other illiberal authoritarianisms’ discourse on gender equality, underscoring to what extent the Turkish authoritarian drift entails an anti-gender evolution in line with the conservative ideological vision of several other populisms.},

The data were analyzed by SPSS and Excel using the frequency, mean score, standard deviation (SD), and one sample t-test. Thirty-three different companies participated in the survey with a return rate of 56.89%. The results were considered statistically significant since all the p-values were below 0.05. The findings revealed that even though 60% of the companies are not using XR, 60% companies have near future plans on implementing them. According to the results, XR was considered as beneficial and highly motivating for the near future, yet it needs to be widespread for companies to keep themselves abreast of information and communication technology trends. Finally, by considering the findings obtained from the results this study reaches a classification of drivers as ‘increased efficiency: time-cost-quality’ and ‘increased communication and coordination’ while barriers as ‘technical limitations’, ‘high costs’, and ‘unqualified professional’.},

   abstract = {This study solved a practical problem in a case in the sheet metal industry using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The problem in the case company was related to detecting the minimum gaps between components, which were produced after the punching operation of a metal sheet. Due to the narrow gaps between the components, an automated sheer machine could not grip the rest of the sheet skeleton properly after the punching operation. This resulted in some of the scraped sheet on the worktable being left behind, which needed a human operator to intervene. This caused an extra trigger to the production line that resulted in a break in production. To solve this critical problem, the relevant images of the components and the gaps between them were analyzed using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The outcome of this study contributed to eliminating the production bottleneck by optimizing the gaps between the punched components. This optimization process facilitated the easy and safe movement of the gripper machine and contributed to minimizing the sheet waste.},

Compared with the traditional transportation accessibility, it is also a comprehensive consideration from the dimension of residents’ demand and service supply to promote the balance of urban park space layout and service coverage. Based on the N-minute service circle, this study establishes a comprehensive evaluation index system to quantitatively assess the service balance of urban parks based on three dimensions of service availability, spatial balance and social equity, taking the Shangcheng District of Hangzhou as an example. And further, an optimization model of urban park system is constructed to carry out spatial analysis and optimal adaptation of urban park system by combining residents’ demand and evaluation. The results show that the overall accessibility of urban park services shows a spatial pattern of “high in the north and low in the middle”, with obvious spatial differentiation along the river area. The urban park system optimized by the model based on the assessment results achieves the “accessibility” and “refined” quality of urban park services. Meanwhile, this study provides a reference for building a more all-age and quality urban park system.},

ASR is needed, especially for online academic video lectures that gradually replace class lectures and traditional textbooks. This conceptual article examines how technological barriers to ASR in under-resourced languages impair accessibility to video content and demonstrates it with the empirical findings of Hebrew ASR evaluations. We compare ASR with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) as facilitating access to textual and speech content and show their current performance in under-resourced languages. We target ASR of under-resourced languages as the main barrier to searching academic video lectures. We further show that information retrieval technologies, such as smart video players that combine both ASR and OCR capacities, must come to the fore once ASR technologies have matured. Therefore, suggesting that the current state of information retrieval from video lectures in under-resourced languages is equivalent to a knowledge dam.},

This study intends to fill this theoretical gap by trying to understand the role of technology-oriented knowledge management practices (KMPs) that serve as managerial antecedents in an organisation’s ACAP. To achieve this goal, qualitative research was conducted among soybean farmers in the state of Goiás (Brazil). The main result was that KMPs were identified as the link between potential and realised ACAP insofar as they have institutionalised the process of creating an organisational memory. The main contribution of this paper was to show that practices of searching, launching, storing, and systematically reviewing information are KMPs related to the organisation’s ACAP. It complements previous papers that associate these constructs. Future research may further explore this relationship in quantitative terms within other contexts.},

The paper proposes workable macroeconomic channels for these countries’ recovery from post-pandemic periods by using historical data to conduct empirical analyses. The paper employs World Bank data and ILOSTAT for 54 African countries within the period 1990–2018. We use a post-Keynesian framework and the difference and system generalized method-of-moments to show that wages drive African economic dynamics in the short run. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries. In addition, foreign output, proxied by European Union output, has a positive and significant impact on Sub-Saharan African economies in the short and long run. The results highlight strategic policy measures for recovering African economies, including improving wages and deepening international economic relations, particularly with the Eurozone countries.},

Which role do or can different kinds of actors play in transitions toward sustainable mobility systems? How are urban mobility cultures changing? Which kinds of new practices and mobility patterns emerge? Do future mobilities re-enforce existing sociotechnical regimes and social inequities or create new ones? In the first part of this introductory article, we give an overview of existing conceptions of sociocultural dimensions of spatial mobility. Furthermore, by drawing on Pitrim Sorokin’s understanding of socioculture, we elaborate a framework that allows us to classify the different contributions to this special issue and to relate them to each other.

This paper is a literature review on how the number of travellers on trains are measured, including technologies and practices for measuring actual ridership. There are a number of publications and practical work done on estimating ridership. We find there are several technologies that can be applied for measuring ridership on trains. The technologies and approaches include (1) Manual counts and surveys, (2) On-board sensors such as door passing, weight, CCTV and Wi-Fi-use, (3) Ticketing systems, ticket sales or ticket validation, and (4) Tracking of travellers for larger part of the journey, e.g. by mobile phones and payments. Data from on-board sensors and ticketing systems are both managed by public transportation providers. By contrast, surveys, payments statistics and mobile phone data may be available to stakeholders outside the public transportation system, which can be an advantage, as access to ridership data can be an issue for business reasons. Furthermore, mobile phone data appears as an interesting option, as they can track complete journeys. New technologies, and especially mobile phone data, are therefore of special interest in future uses of ridership data for evaluations and quality assessments.},

It is based on 45 semi-structured interviews conducted in eleven local news organizations in European French-speaking countries (France, Switzerland and Belgium), that explored the implementation of actions aiming at revitalizing the link with audiences, the role of the hierarchy and the allocation of human and material resources to this end. Findings reveal two organizational modalities that characterize how the issue of audiences is taken into account in local news media. A proactive and integrated modality describes news media that tend to include the issue of audiences in the internal organization in a tangible, visible and structured way. A reactive and diluted modality describes news media that tend to favor a more variable and opportunistic approach to audience relations. This typology, built empirically from our data, does not claim to situate a news outlet in a definitive manner, but rather suggests a reading grid for questioning the degree of formalization of the issue of audiences within the organizational process of local news media.},

Pairs of TPM practices and I4.0 technologies with significant positive correlations in all partial correlation sets indicate positive trends in the adoption of elements in the pairs, regardless of context, and may be viewed as indicators of TPM practices and I4.0 technologies more prone to be integrated. Our results identified 67 pairs of I4.0 technologies and TPM practices meeting the significance criterion. Four TPM practices (fostering operator ownership, standardization of AM checks, setting 3M—machine/man/material—conditions, and constant search for the next generation of technology) and two I4.0 technologies (Internet-of-Things, and big data) appeared in 26 of the 67 pairs.

Empirical literature has suggested ambiguous results regarding the beneficial effects of FDI on host economies. In this study panel ARDL approach is employed using the PMG estimator, as the most suitable for our dataset. DFE and MG estimators are also implemented. The results indicate strong evidence that there is a positive long-run relationship between FDI and growth for the original EU members. However, regarding the new EU members, only the extended model provides statistical evidence of positive long-run relationship between FDI and growth. The positive and statistically significant long-run relationship between FDI and economic growth for all countries underlines the need for policy makers to formulate policies to attract FDI. Furthermore, the results of the study show that policy makers of EU countries characterized by high levels of corruption should focus on anti-corruption policies, as corruption seems to hinder the positive effects of both FDI and other determinants of economic growth.},

Drawing on behavioral reasoning theory, this study proposes and empirically tests a model to explain sport spectator adoption of fan experience apps (FEA). By considering both reasons for and reasons against adopting FEA, the model represents an important theoretical extension of existing innovation frameworks in sport marketing. Using a qualitative pre-study, I operationalized reasons using specific pro-adoption factors (i.e., enjoyment, ease of use, game-related content, and social interaction) and anti-adoption factors (i.e., distraction from the game, declining atmosphere, social risk, and data security concerns). Survey data collected among German team sport spectators (N = 792) confirmed that both reasons for adoption (positively) and reasons against adoption (negatively) influenced adoption attitudes, usage intentions, and actual use of FEA. The results indicated that reasons for adoption had a stronger relative impact on spectators’ responses to FEA than reasons against. The study also delineated the relative contribution of specific pro-adoption and anti-adoption factors to overall reasons for and against adoption. The findings imply that FEA developers, marketing communications directed at potential users, and market research that explores consumer opinions of these technological innovations should take into account both reasons for and against FEA usage.},

An inductive analysis based uponin-depth, semi-structured interviews with multiple business actors identified VCC in an emerging e-commerce channel where digital technologies enabled engagement and interaction amongst channel members. The results suggest that market scripting based upon an inclusive, collaborative and empowerment ideology, which can lead to sustainable development and income redistribution from consumers to producers, was explicitly embedded in their VCC agenda. Fair-trade practices supported customer-driven innovations. For consumers, digital technologies created online ‘consumption communities’ where information and educational interactions supported online food purchases and innovation in the supply chain ‘pull’ strategies. The paper concludes that the logic underpinning this new transformative business approach of digitally enabled VCC in local BOP markets is akin to a ‘social justice logic’.},

   abstract = {The growing digitization puts more pressure on brick-and-mortar businesses in the retail sector by creating new and more complex customer demands that increase the need for cooperative and trustful exchange relationships between supervisors and salespeople. A promising approach to tackle these challenges lies in implementing less hierarchical leadership structures. While sharing leadership on the team level gains traction among practitioners as a viable form of horizontal leadership, research provides little evidence on the conditions and mechanisms that enable a shared leadership work environment for retail salespeople. Especially the role of formal leaders in such a transition remains unclear. To fill this void, we followed a two-study design. We conducted a large-scale survey with 1,527 salespeople of a German fashion retailer to analyze how formal leadership contributes to the existence of a less hierarchically structured work environment for retail salespeople. Our multiple mediation analysis provides in-depth and context-sensitive insights into conditions and mechanisms that facilitate a shared leadership environment. A subsequent online-based scenario experiment confirms that transformational leadership is a driver for a shared leadership environment. We contribute to the literature by showing that transformational leadership matters not only in business-to-business (B2B) settings but also in traditionally more transactional business-to-consumer (B2C) retail sales settings to create a shared leadership environment.},

Semi-structured interviews with 13 metaverse users and professionals were conducted to derive context-specific consumption values. Our findings enrich and extend the theory of consumption values literature by redefining the five consumption values according to the metaverse usage. The five values have been identified as: utilitarianism, social identity, personification, hedonism, and personal beliefs.

Derived from such an initiative, the Operator 5.0 concept surged to place the operator as the main value-creation contributor of sustainable and resilient human-machine systems. Smart service systems are data-driven services that provide intelligent capabilities to support decision-making in business processes. Despite previous research on smart services driven by multiple technologies in different contexts, further studies approaching Digital Twins as enablers of smart services in machine use phases are yet to be explored. Digital Twin, an Industry 5.0 enabler, is a technology that virtually represents physical assets that collect and analyze data from actual operations to make predictions for decision-making. Simulation-based Digital Twins generate simulation models that are continuously upgraded with asset data in real time, improving the accuracy of predictions. This paper aims to investigate how the Simulation-based Digital Twins (SDT) can enable the development of smart services in the Operator 5.0 context. We build on a multiple case study of 13 interviews from nine heavy mobile machinery manufacturers. We capture our results in categorizing SDT-enabled smart services for the use phases of the machine lifecycle. The categorization identifies the capabilities of each smart service for decision-making support and value co-creation.},

(2) Chinese tourism enterprises’ overseas investment favoured regions with a sound institutional environment, showing significant national heterogeneity in general; specifically, Chinese tourism enterprises’ overseas investment featured an institutional risk preference for countries along the B&R and institutional risk aversion for non-B&R countries.(3) Chinese tourism enterprises’ overseas investment exhibited institutional preferences and path dependence due to multiple investment motivations and bilateral political relations during location selection. Strong and stable bilateral relations were complementary to the host country’s institutional quality, namely mutual high-level government visits. International sister city relations between China and B&R countries could also compensate for the impact of poor bilateral relations on host countries’ institutional quality.},

   abstract = {Background: The impact of perceived organizational support on the creativity of science-technology talents in the digital era is an important domain for fostering innovation power and the long-term competitive advantage of enterprises. The main purpose of this study is to reveal the “black box” mechanism of perceived organizational support on the creativity of science-technology talents in the digital environment, guide enterprises to attach importance to perceived organizational support and enhance the creativity of science-technology talents. Methods: Based on resource conservation theory and social exchange theory, this study took the science-technology talents of Chinese high-tech enterprises as the research object, combined 380 matching data of science-technology talents and supervisors, and used AMOS, MPLUS, and SPSS software to test all hypotheses. Results: Perceived organizational support has a significant positive impact on the creativity of science-technology talents, affective commitment and innovative self-efficacy. Affective commitment and innovative self-efficacy have significant positive effects on the creativity of science-technology talents. Digital thinking positively moderates the relationship between perceived organizational support and affective commitment, innovative self-efficacy. Affective commitment and innovative self-efficacy play a moderated mediation role between perceived organizational support and the creativity of science-technology talents. Conclusion: Perceived organizational support promotes the creativity of science-technology talents through affective commitment and innovative self-efficacy, which is moderated by digital thinking. These findings not only help deepen and expand the theoretical research on perceived organizational support and creativity, but also inspire managers to guide science-technology talents to work creatively from the aspects of affective commitment, innovative self-efficacy and digital thinking.},

This paper demonstrates that external networks and spillovers could be important sources for firms’ innovation performance in the digital era, which points to the potential benefits of digitalisation for knowledge spillovers and innovation. This paper employs Chinese city-level and firm-level data with 12,487 firm-year observations from 2011 to 2019 to conduct the empirical analysis. The results show that regional digital development facilitates firm innovation, especially collaborative innovation activities among firms. This paper further shows that firms with lower supplier concentration benefit more from digital development in terms of innovation. In terms of heterogeneity, technology-intensive and relatively small firms benefit from digital development. This paper contributes to the literature by filling the gap about the mechanisms of digital development on firm innovation and by examining the role of suppliers in firm innovation in the digital era. To foster advances in innovation, this paper provides relevant theoretical and practical implications.},

This has led to significant improvements in the quality and timeliness of the information that can be used by management in decision-making and strategic planning. Even how managers use this information is being shaped by technologies that can augment human knowledge to further improve decision-making.

This digital resource is devoted to the collection, management and dissemination of unrealized artwork projects from the 1950s onwards. It is at the same time an archive of research data, in the spirit of Open Access, and an archive of documentation of the work of the artists. This paper is organized in two sections, through which the dual dimension of the digital resource, institutional and private, will be analysed. The first section explains the structure of this digital museum, while the second analyses acquisition and digitizing policies, and cataloguing rules. The distinction between different generations of artists has been chosen to demonstrate how the work of the curators can change while working to build a digital museum (through the interaction with other private or institutional archives, and the participatory work of artists and curators). From this analysis, the interaction between the peculiarities of contemporary art research and the digital dimension of MoRE will emerge.},

Furthermore, very few studies have directly compared the effects of different practice contexts (e.g. practice in a telecollaborative context versus practice in a face-to-face context) on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence (e.g. in compliment responses [CRs]). Adopting the Skill Acquisition Theory (DeKeyser, 2015), the current study is the first to compare the influence of telecollaborative video-based practice and traditional face-to-face practice on L2 learners’ pragmatic competence in CRs. Sixty-five third-year college students from a university in China received instruction on CRs. After the instruction, they were randomly assigned to a telecollaborative video-based group or a face-to-face group. Thirty-three learners participated in three-week video-based telecollaboration with first language (L1) speakers of English via WeChat (a multi-purpose application including making video calls), whereas 32 students engaged in three-week face-to-face communication with the L1 speakers of English in a classroom. The results from multi-modal discourse completion tasks on the immediate and delayed post-tests revealed that the telecollaborative video-based group outperformed the face-to-face group in pragmalinguistic accuracy, fluency, and diversity of CR strategies, demonstrating a facilitative and long-term influence of telecollaborative video-based practice on L2 pragmatic development. Pedagogical implications for L2 instructors are discussed (e.g. incorporating deliberate, authentic, and engaging telecollaborative activities into curricula).},

   abstract = {In recent years, the literature has paid considerable attention to digital twin technology for the implementation of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing. Most of the literature argues that simulation models are a key platform for digital twins and considers discrete-event simulation to be a suitable method to model real dynamic manufacturing systems. However, the discrete-event simulation of complex manufacturing systems is a time-consuming process. Therefore, it is difficult to deal with the large-scale discrete optimisation problems in digital twin shop floors. To bridge this research gap, we propose an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method based on multi-fidelity optimisation with ordinal transformation and optimal sampling (MO2TOS) in the current research. The proposed method embeds heuristic algorithms to accelerate the solution space search efficiency in MO2TOS. Moreover, we develop an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation system by integrating the proposed method with discrete-event simulation tools and apply this system to a digital twin-based aircraft parts production workshop. Based on this digital twin shop floor, we conduct different production planning experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method is well-applied in solving large-scale problems and outperforms other simulation-based optimisation methods.},

While direct effects of these initiatives on performance have been found, the nature and performance effects of interactions among these two initiatives remain largely unexamined. This exploratory study theorises and investigates how I4.0 technologies can facilitate CLSC initiatives. Data are collected and analysed from enterprises located in the northeast of Italy. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is deployed to analyse the data. The data suggest a significant and beneficial moderator of I4.0 technologies on the relationship between CLSC practices and firm environmental and social performance. The data fails to find a significant relationship between CLSC practices and financial performance. Data-driven I4.0 technologies are seen to be of greater significance in such moderator roles, comparative to process-driven I4.0 technologies. Our analysis suggests that companies may be advised to adopt a targeted, systems approach for using data-driven I4.0 applications in conjunction with CLSC practices in order to realise performance gains. The findings represent important building blocks in developing theory in this formative area of study. Further implications are discussed from theoretical and practical perspectives.

One of the important criteria in topology selection is the availability of a well-functioning protection scheme. A significant part of the DC microgrid protection system literature considers differential protection schemes for various topologies. However this scheme doesn’t work satisfactorily with noisy measurements. Noisy measurements are a reality and can not be avoided for any real engineering system. This article proposes a robust protection scheme to alleviate some problems associated with topology selection. The proposed scheme considers noisy current measurements and works by estimating the time derivative of line currents. The proposed approach uses continuous finite-time convergent differentiator to estimate the derivative. The gains of the differentiator were tuned through Firefly algorithm-based optimization technique. Matlab/Simulink ®-based simulations verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the existing differential current scheme.},

   abstract = {During the last decades, the increasing need to ensure building performance during architectural design has led to highly interactive relations between architecture and various other disciplines, in which concepts of sustainability and building performance are tightly integrated into the design process. However, the adoption of these concepts in architectural practices and the recent advancements in the field have remained rather slow. This research aims to understand performative design (PD) in the context of existing design practices and investigate integrated design strategies and potentials of computational design throughout the whole design process. In this research, a qualitative study was carried out, focusing on PD processes in architectural practices based on semi-structured interviews and case studies. The collected data from nine selected architectural practices is analyzed through a thematic coding approach. The findings reveal that the widespread use of computational tools and technologies and the increasing awareness of both architects and clients on building performance have changed the design priorities in architectural practices. The results also show that the competence of the design team, the tools used during design processes, the involvement of direct and indirect stakeholders, shifting client demands, and market values are effective in pursuing an integrated PD process. Consequently, this research contributes to the current understanding of performative architectural design practices by investigating the key performance concepts, supporting computational tools, and finally the current practices of PD.},

This study aims to explore the need and dimensions of a new media brand trust scale that reflects the reality of today’s mediated lives and converging industries. As the first phase of the scale development process, this study integrated deductive and inductive methods, using literature review to offer a conceptual basis, and exploring the identified trust dimensions through the qualitative method of personal interviews. A total of 28 subjects from two different countries were interviewed to assess their perceptions and experiences regarding their trust of various media products/services. Eight key dimensions of media brand trust were uncovered. While competence remains a valid aspect of trust as suggested by extant literature, classic intentionality or benevolence is less significant today. The study also revealed the trust dimensions of relationship, experience, and value, which were not addressed in typical media trust related literature. This study introduces the notion of value-creation into the tradition of media trust which focused mostly on the dimension of credibility. The integrative approach is holistic and reflects more plausibly how decisions are made in modern platform/media brand choice.},

   abstract = {This article considers the many layered and multi-faceted questions of hybridity as interdisciplinary encounter through the lens of a central case study–the EU-funded project, CultureMoves (2018-2020), on which the Centre for Dance Research (C-DaRE) was a collaborating partner. With Europeana principles as a backdrop for the re-use of cultural heritage content, CultureMoves was an 18-month long project that aimed to develop a series of digital tools enabling new forms of touristic engagement and dance educational resources. The CultureMoves project is marked by hybridity in terms of its very interdisciplinarity, in its rooting in an interpretation of ‘creative tourism’ (Richards and Raymond 2000; Richards and Marques 2012) as a means of enhancing encounters between artists, tourists and communities and in its focus on the expanded sense of the coming together of dance artist and cultural heritage site. With particular reference to the broader field of creative tourism, this article reflects on the key questions and assumptions that underlie existing and potential collaborations between the dance research/ education, digital technology and tourism sectors, and which prepared the terrain for the toolkit development. The article will also provide a close examination of experiments in the project that intend to awaken new experiences of space and place, and dormant histories, through bringing dancing bodies into relation with the built environment and digital technologies, as an intervention into creative (and cultural) tourism. Marked by the intersection of the human and non-human, and the differing expectations of stakeholders and audiences, the discussion also considers where experiments fail, to offer a view of what that tells us about the limits of hybridity in performance.},

Consequently, using data from a semi-systematic review, we develop a framework focusing on crowdfunding parties and the five perceived attributes of innovation diffusion to evaluate the possibility of diffusion in crowdfunding. Employing thematic analysis, we identify two possible modes for blockchain application in crowdfunding. Results indicate the technology offers superior relative advantage and compatibility for contracting parties. Nonetheless, fundraisers and investors could have potential diffusion complexities because of limited knowledge. Platforms face uncertainties over the degree of mediation and regulatory compliance. Further, trialability and observability issues cast doubts on the potential switch. Therefore, advanced stakeholder engagement and blockchain regulatory reform is required to expedite this switch.},

Results of this research show how marketing educators can introduce Big Data concepts in their marketing classes and incorporate new teaching techniques. The results of our first study show that ability factors, affective factors, and interest in big data have an impact on marketing students’ attitudes toward big data courses. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that the students’ competitiveness traits and the academic value of big data do not have an impact on marketing students’ attitudes toward big data courses. Our second study emphasizes the importance of integrating big data courses into marketing education programs. It also lists the requirements for teaching big data in marketing programs, including the skills, qualifications, and experience of big data instructors. Collectively, this research provides insights associated with the growing desire to upskill in big data by marketers and the belief that these skills will be necessary for the future.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Remarkable progress in healthcare technology has recently been made alongside changes in concepts related to drugs and medical devices. It is speculated that this progress benefits not only patients but also healthcare professionals, such as medical doctors. We performed a systematic review of the characteristics of current data assessment tools to measure medical doctors’ work-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Ichushi-Web in 2020. The related search terms used were ‘medical doctor,’ ‘quality of work life,’ and ‘questionnaire/interview.’ Two reviewers independently screened the studies, and the characteristics of the QOL assessment tools used in the identified studies were qualitatively reviewed and summarized. Results: In total, 5,443 and 760 articles were retrieved from PubMed and Ichushi-Web, respectively, of which 82 studies were included in this review. Sixty-five (79%) studies used structured questionnaires, and 17 (21%) studies used semistructured questionnaires. In terms of the study purpose, the identified studies mainly included four: mental health, the work or labor situation, satisfaction, and QOL. Components used to measure work-related QOL included satisfaction, burnout, QOL, the work environment, stress, mental health, work-life balance, and others. None of the studies used an originally developed QOL questionnaire to assess the work-related benefits of medical doctors. Conclusion: This systematic review found that there is a lack of studies directly assessing the work-related QOL of medical doctors and a lack of effective data collection tools to assess all work-related QOL components.},

Higher level forms of automation are prevalent particularly at the prosumer or entrylevel end of software culture, and illustrate how software culture serves more broadly as a realm for the evolution of hybrid assemblages of human and nonhuman. This paper addresses a number of patterns of automated practices within software-based videography, including the Ken Burns Effect and the emergence of mechanisms we can identify as 'meaning-making engines'. These enable the harvesting and curating of networked material into a variety of cultural forms, encouraging both individual and collaborative practices that engage with all manner of data structures (including video). This part of the digital ecology is still in its early stages but nonetheless features experimentation with and expansion of 'meaning-making' practices that have implications for the nature and 'evolution' of user-generated culture (and for emerging documentary practices).},

Our case study is the Norwegian newspaper industry’s revenue streams from 2006 to 2019, a media market deemed particularly successful in making readers pay for news online. By means of industry data, we measure revenue diversification by applying the Revenue Diversity Index—an index which quantifies the number of revenue streams and the distribution amongst them for the whole newspaper industry. The findings identify a forced diversification which challenges assumptions of a simple and positive relationship between revenue diversification and economic performance. We find that revenue structures have flipped from an advertising based model to an audience dominated model, with a larger diversity of revenue sources but lower total revenues overall. The increasing prices of digital journalism may further expand knowledge gaps in the population between those willing and able to pay and those who are not.},

   abstract = {The potential of collaborative robotics often does not materialize in an efficient design of the human-robot collaboration. Technology-oriented approaches are no longer enough in the Industry 4.0 era. This work proposes a set of methods to support manufacturing engineers in the human-oriented design process of integrated production systems to obtain satisfactory performance in the mass customization paradigm, without impacting the safety and health of workers. It founds the design criteria definition on five main pillars (safety, ergonomics, effectiveness, flexibility, and costs), favors the consideration of different design alternatives, and leads their selection. The dynamic impact of the design choices on the various elements of the system prevails over the static design constraints. The method has been experimented in collaboration with the major kitchen manufacturer in Italy, which introduced a collaborative robotics cell in the drawers’ assembly line. It resulted in a more balanced production line (10% more), a verified risk minimization (RULA score reduced from 5 to 3 and OCRA score from 13.30 to 5.70), and a greater allocation of operators to high added value activities.},

Although Italy has an important national railway heritage, local railway tourism is still in an early development stage. In 2021, research was conducted by the Department of Management of the University of Turin, which involved the key stakeholders in railway tourism, in order to explore and define strategies for further development. A mixed-method approach was used in defining the process in three stages: a focus group of experts to design a dedicated questionnaire, the Delphi method to conduct individual stakeholder interviews, and the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) for the presentation of survey results, and identification of stakeholders’ priorities. The results identified the key elements of the market and established players in the Italian railway tourism supply chain to implement operational strategies to develop this form of tourism, and in line with the interest of the younger generation. Italian railway tourism has considerable potential due to the cultural, historical, and scenic heritage of the railway lines which can be enhanced by operational organisations. Moreover, this tourism activity is a useful tool for economies and operators in the local areas.},

For the field of digital development, this objective presents a particular challenge. While digital technologies can be utilized to reduce certain inequalities, they are also linked to reproductive mechanisms, reinforcing existing inequalities. In the context of an increasing digitalization of development, particular attention must therefore be paid to the link between digital inequalities and the quest to leave no-one behind. This article analyses the integration of intersectional inequalities in the SDG framework and the resulting need for coherent policies, and demonstrates the parallels between this challenge and the reproductive nature of digital inequalities. On this basis, we argue that the issue of digital inequalities should be mainstreamed in development programming in order to avoid worsening existing inequalities through digital development. Moreover, we discuss recommendations for a potential post-2030 agenda succeeding the SDGs.},

Hence, promoting anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability (ACTA) in supply chain and procurement has never been more important. The adoption of digital tools, if designed and implemented appropriately, can reduce the risks of corruption. Areas Covered: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an interdisciplinary systematic review of health/medicine, humanities/social sciences, engineering, and computer science literature, with the aims of identifying technologies used for pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement optimization and reviewing whether they address ACTA mechanisms to strengthen pharmaceutical governance. Our review identified four distinct categories of digital solutions: e-procurement and open contracting; track-and-trace technology; anti-counterfeiting technology; and blockchain technology. Expert Opinion: Findings demonstrate an increase in research of technologies to improve pharmaceutical supply chain and procurement functions; however, most technologies are not being leveraged to directly address ACTA or global health outcomes. Some blockchain and RFID technologies incorporated ACTA mechanisms and mentioned specific policy/governance frameworks, but more purposeful linkage is needed. Findings point to the need for targeted policy development and governance to activate these innovative technologies to improve global health.},

A user authentication system that is easy, robust, scalable, and cost-effective is a must. For both security and surveillance purposes, keystroke biometrics is a viable option. Behavior biometrics, of which keystroke biometrics is a subset, is used to identify individuals based on the way they type. Typing habits are not set in stone and are subject to change depending on the scenario, the device being used, and the user’s emotional state. As a result, the performance of a keystroke biometrics-based user authentication system is influenced by how well the retrieved information from typing and classification algorithms is processed. Using a keyboard with an array of pressure sensors, this research presents a unique way to keystroke dynamics-based authentication. The goal of this study is to develop user profiles that are unique and different in order to improve the suggested system’s efficiency. A real-world dataset is used to test the suggested method. The outcome is achieved with a 97% success rate in experiments.},

This algorithm restores the blurred image by incorporating a curvelet-based empirical Wiener filter with a spatial-based joint non-local means filter. Curvelets provide a multidirectional and multiscale decomposition that has been mathematically shown to represent distributed discontinuities such as edges better than traditional wavelets. Our method restores the image in the frequency domain to obtain a noisy result with minimal loss of image components, followed by an empirical Wiener filter in the curvelet domain to attenuate the leaked noise. Although the curvelet-based methods are efficient in edgepreserving image denoising, they are prone to producing edge ringing which relates to the structure of the underlying curvelet. In order to reduce the ringing, we develop an efficient joint non-local means filter by using the curvelet deblurring result. This filter could suppress the leaked noise while preserving image details. We compare our deblurring algorithm with a few competitive deblurring techniques in terms of improvement in signal-to-noise-ratio (ISNR) and visual quality. © 2014 RPS.},
