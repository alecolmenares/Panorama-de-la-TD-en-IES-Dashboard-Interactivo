	abstract = {Fierce competition in the global economy has accelerated the evolution of e-commerce and the emergence of digital transformation. It also challenges both industry and higher education. In particular, e-commerce skills have become a critical capability of entrepreneurship education. Based on the dynamic capability theory, this study explores e-commerce competency on the basis of gamified e-commerce competition – the Yahoo E-commerce Idea Competition (ECIC). This paper aims to develop C2C e-commerce competencies and explore how these competencies relate to e-commerce performance. We invited participants from the Yahoo ECIC to participate in our survey. Exploratory factor analysis identified four C2C e-commerce competencies: e-marketing strategy, live streaming, operational management, and strategic planning. Stepwise regression analysis also showed that four e-commerce competencies contribute to e-commerce performance. Our findings provide theoretical and practical contributions to the analysis of gamified EC competition and creation of C2C EC competencies for entrepreneurship education. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study tried to unveil the female students’ awareness level in the department of information technology, Umm Al Qura University, Saudi Arabia with the criteria of digital citizenship under the digital revolution in the world today. The digital transformation has a great effect on how persons would deal with the digital data and information. The study depended on the descriptive analytical methodology, because the nature of this methodology is suitable for the subject of the study from the beginning of data collection, that are required to the study, analyzing and interpreting data, to the results phase, that contributes in achieving the goals of this study. Current results pointed out that the total level of female students’ awareness level with the nine criteria of digital citizenship was medium with an average of 139.3 degree. The total values of the nine criteria from the lowest to the highest value ranges from 149 to 237 degree. In some criteria, the female students’ awareness level was high, but in other criteria, this level was medium. The students’ awareness level was raised with the following criteria: “digital access to the information sources”, “educational services”, “electronic market”, “digital communication”, “digital etiquette”, “digital laws”, “digital rights and responsibilities”, and “digital security”. On the other hand, female the students’ awareness level was medium with two creating the criterion of “promotion of digital culture” and the criterion of “digital health and safety”. Among the most important recommendations of this study is the enlightenment of society with the digital revolution, and the dissemination of a culture of digital citizenship among Members of the Society, in addition to putting forward a plan at the level of Saudi universities to teach the “digital citizenship” curriculum. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {A review of the literature found that there is a research gap when it comes to the use of public e-services, especially by young people, so the contribution of this paper is in enriching scientific knowledge in this area. A special contribution is the research of the factors that influence the use of e-government services by generations Y and Z. Regarding the practical implications, we have concluded that the system itself needs to be further upgraded with more services tailored for the younger generations, and that an even larger number of institutions and organizations at all levels (from local to central, state level) should be integrated into the system. It is certainly extremely important to further educate all groups of citizens about the benefits and uses of e-services, especially in the public sector and the benefits that such use brings, both for system users – citizens and networked systems, but also for the functioning of the public sector in terms of improving its efficiency and process optimization, thus improving service performance and user experience in the public sector. The limitation of the research lies in the used Model of acceptance of public services of the e-Citizens system which does not cover all dimensions of the issue of acceptance of public services of e-government (used constructs explain only 27.3% of the intended use) and appropriate sampling of students from the University of Zadar. When it comes to guidelines for further research, international comparisons should certainly be made – e.g., whether the level and use of e-public services among young people in different countries and different cultural and socio-economic contexts differs and what are the new models for digital literacy enhancement through the entire vertical of the education system, but also through other formal and informal forms of education. The question that also arises is to what extent the e-Citizens system, as well as similar systems of using e-services are well communicated to the whole society; whether everyone knows about such systems, whether they are familiar with its functioning, what are the advantages it brings and similar. © 2023, Institute for Public Administration, Croatian and Comparative Public Administration.

	abstract = {The concept of Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0 is not a simple chronological continuation or alternative to Industry 4.0 paradigm. Society 5.0 aims to place human beings at the midpoint of innovation, exploiting the impact of technology and Industry 4.0 results with the technological integration to improve quality of life, social responsibility and sustainability. This ground-breaking perspective has common points with the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. It also has major implication for universities transformations. Universities are called upon producing knowledge for new technologies and social innovation. In our paper, we argue that digitalisation opens new perspectives for universities and can become one of the main drivers of their change. Incorporating the assumptions of Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0 into the universities practices and policies will allow both universities and societies to fully benefit from digital transformation. Making the human-oriented innovation as the universities trademark and developing new cooperative models will also help to achieve sustainable priorities. The use of the Quintuple Helix Model (QHM) might foster the process of necessary transformations capacities as it integrates different perspectives and sets the stage for sustainability priorities and considerations. As far as the practical goal is concerned, the paper proposes a set of recommendations for universities aiming at developing new forms and channels of distribution of education, research and innovation within in the context of QHM and Society 5.0. We call them socially and digitally engaged model. © 2021, The Author(s).},

For the successful implementation of these regulations and policies, however, critical success factors including corporate governance have to be considered. Despite the extensive research on the importance of developing effective and reliable governance policies and practices for the overall growth of organizations including universities, no sufficient studies on the role of corporate governance in improving sustainable development plans and combating corruption, improving transparency, and enhancing sustainable development plans in the Saudi universities. This study, therefore, seeks to explore the impact of CG on improving accountability and sustainable development plans in Departments of English in Saudi universities. In-depth interviews were conducted with 48 participants, including the head of the English departments in four Saudi universities. Results indicate that the contributions of the universities to sustainable development plans and strategies are still under expectations. In this regard, the universities and higher education institutions in Saudi Arabia should replace the traditional academic model with the corporate model. The departments of English should address the changing needs of their candidates and students in this global world, and this has to be reflected in their sustainable development plans. Governance, however, should be enforced in all their operations as a critical success factor for sustainable development planning.

	abstract = {Traditionally, specialists with multilingual competences have been more highly valued in the labor market in any field of activity. However, the term “multilingualism” is losing original meaning, which implies mastery of several foreign languages in modern universal digital transformation’s world. Today, multilingual competences imply not only a high level of foreign language proficiency, but also the ability to quickly perceive digital languages, i.e. to intuitively use various digital services, software packages and applications, understanding the principles of algorithm and computer program development. The global digitalization of the economy, accelerated by pandemic restrictions, has accelerated the digitalization of higher education institutions. Digitalization has forced students, faculty, and university administrators to rapidly adopt new digital services. The article examines the features of the digital transformation of universities that won the competition of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education held within the framework of the national program “Digital Economy in the Russian Federation” to develop a digital university model. The analysis revealed general trends in the digital transformation of universities, showing that the development of a digital university model is a complex task aimed at re-engineering business processes with the capabilities of modern IT technologies by introducing digital services in all areas of university activities: administrative, educational, scientific and innovative. The authors conclude that it is necessary to intensify the replication of the developed model of the digital university and the possibility of disseminating the best practices of digitalization of business processes by universities around the world. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This paper conceptualizes the effects of digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. It focuses on understanding the effects of causal factors (COVID-19 and digital transformation, on teachers’ beliefs and practices. In the context of this conceptual paper, we delineate this to university education but argue that it is conceptually applicable to any educational setting. Our exploration of the phenomenon has yielded the conclusion that beliefs/attitudes are fluid, are formed cyclically, and that teachers’ associated behaviour/practices are located along a continuum and are influenced by both technological and personal factors. We believe our arguments are valid because when COVID-19 fades as an “event”, the world will have evolved new norms that include newer practices, inevitably informed by technological and personal factors. We provide a basis for understanding the effects of digitally transformed environments and how one might respond to such eventualities. We suggest a theoretical model that outlines the moderating constructs inherent in any digitally transformed environment. The theoretical model provides a hook for research into the beliefs-practice nexus and as a basis for supporting teachers in digitally transformed environments. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In this work, we aim to understand professors’ perception of the key competences as well as the best educational strategies and technological tools to guide digital transformation (DT) in education, according to their experience in emergency remote teaching (ERT). In recent years, technological advancement has driven DT in many areas, with education being among them. ERT due to COVID-19 accelerated this transition. Restrictions and lockdowns forced higher education institutions to adopt remote teaching strategies and tools suited for a digital environment. We surveyed 100 professors from a private Mexican university with 15-month experience of online ERT. We asked them through Likert scale questions to self-evaluate their performance and whether they perceived it to be better in online or hybrid environments compared with face-to-face environments in different aspects. We performed correlation, cluster, and factor analysis to identify the relationships and patterns in their answers. Through open-ended questions, we also asked the participants about the challenges and achievements they experienced, and the educational strategies and technological tools they successfully incorporated during ERT. We also conducted text mining to extract the most relevant information from these answers and validated that they were not polarized with negative sentiment using a large language model. Our results showed social intelligence as an underlying competence for teaching performance was highlighted in the digital environment due to the physical interaction limitations. Participants found success in implementing information and communication technologies, resulting in maintaining student interest and building trust in the online environment. Professors recognized the relevance not only of learning management systems and communication platforms, as expected, but also hardware such as tablets, cameras, and headphones for the successful delivery of education in a digital environment. Technology Enhanced Learning transposes game-based, quizzing practices, and collaborative learning to digital environments. Furthermore, the professors recommended learning-by-doing, flipped learning, problem-based learning, game-based learning, and holistic education as some pedagogical methodologies that were successfully applied in ERT and could be implemented for DT. Understanding the gains concerning teaching learning strategies and technologies that were incorporated during ERT is of the utmost importance for driving DT and its benefits for current and future education.

	abstract = {Enterprise architecture (EA) plays a crucial role in organizations by providing a clear strategy for digital transformation and seamless information flow across boundaries. It is a tool for achieving current and future objectives effectively. By providing a comprehensive view, EA helps organizations build suitable and sustainable software solutions while avoiding complex challenges caused by unmanageable information flow blockages. Moreover, EA provides a standard framework for implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although EA and ERP systems have different concepts, they possess complementary characteristics that support decision-makers in the ERP selection process, which can be quite risky due to cost feasibility, time consumption, and team effort. This study proposes using the EA concept as a reference module for selecting the most suitable integrated solution for the higher education sector. The aim is to provide high-impact criteria for choosing the most appropriate ERP system as a core solution. Additionally, EA supports other related solutions integrated with the ERP system under the EA umbrella to run a fully automated smart entity. To determine the most suitable ERP solution for higher education entities in the study country, a set of critical criteria for ERP selection as a core solution in the education sector is generated through brainstorming, which is based on an EA reference module specifically designed for higher education entities that seek to operate smartly. A comparison technique is employed to evaluate the highlighted criteria, including a case study for ABC University. The study’s results reveal that fully integrated and sustainable solutions can be envisioned for higher education entities, which can support the digital transformation of the higher education sector based on a smart EA reference module along with a set of critical main ERP selection criteria. This can mitigate the risk associated with ERP selection as a core solution and support decision-makers in selecting the most suitable ERP package for educational entities. © 2023 by the authors.},

This article aims to identify the main factors that can drive and facilitate the digital transformation of Higher Education Institutions from the point of view of internal stakeholders. In terms of methodology and due to the complexity of this phenomenon, the case method was considered the most appropriate for this study. As the results show, it is necessary to implement technological innovations according to the needs, establish adequate channels to communicate the process and transform the current traditional culture into a digital one. Data-driven decision-making and the development of a participative leadership style will allow the organisation to adapt to changes over time. It will also enable the retention of digital talent, which is critical to the success of the organisation’s transformation. This will ensure the development and survival of the institution. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Affected by the COVID-19, many colleges have adopted online teaching. Meanwhile, the digital transformation of academic journals has shifted readers’ reading habits from traditional paper media to digital media. Digital academic reading has become the main reading method of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the behavioral characteristics of college students’ digital academic reading and explore the internal factors and external environmental factors affecting the Intention and Use behavior of digital academic reading. At the same time this study provide recommendations to address these influencing factors in terms of the individual, the environment and library resources. Methods: Based on UTAUT2 model and digital academic reading theories, this paper constructs a digital academic reading information behavior (DARB) model of college students to examine college students’ digital academic reading behavior and intention. College students with digital academic reading behavior were recruited as research participants. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to collect representative samples from universities in Nanjing. 239 respondents participated in the questionnaire, with 189 providing valid data. Results: Effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), price value (PV), perceived risk (PR) and habit (BH) have a significant impact on behavioral intention (BI), and behavioral intention (BI) and habit (BH) have a significant impact on use behavior (B). However, performance expectancy (PE) and facilitating conditions (FC) have no significant influence on behavioral intention (BI). Originality/value: The findings of this study will help fill the gap in previous research on the relationship between the influencing factors of digital academic reading and college students’ reading intentions and behaviors, so as to provide a basis for improving the academic reading literacy program in colleges and optimizing the current digital academic reading environment.

Evaluation of students’ innovative readiness for the transition to the University 4.0 model can provide guidance on what actions and policies should be taken to achieve an educational institution’s digital transformation goals. This article aims to study the essential scientific and pedagogical elements that cause the educational format to evolve in the context of advanced technology trends and determine physics students’ innovation readiness for digital learning within the University 4.0 model. The survey was extended to the online forum University 4.0: Prospects for Modernising Approaches to Teaching Physics. The survey results showed the degree of readiness of physics students to implement digital approaches in teaching in four dimensions. Students had a high level of creativity and a positive attitude toward innovative educational activities (M = 3.89); they also had a high level of motivation for digital innovative training and sufficient knowledge of how the training will help them achieve their educational goals and professional and personal competence (M = 3.85); and they had a high level of digital literacy (M = 3.96). The scientific value of this article lies in demonstrating the developed methodology for determining and evaluating the degree of innovative readiness of students in the process of transition to a new educational format University 4.0. This methodology can be used in the process of developing an innovative strategy for organizing the educational process in the conditions of Industry 4.0 taking into account its challenges and opportunities. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In the process of growing societies, and especially in the digital era we live in, there is a need for a strong push for innovation that puts citizens at the center of the process from the beginning to build more resilient, cooperative and flexible communities. Different collaborative design approaches have emerged in recent decades, one of the most interesting being Living Labs, which involves user-centered design and co-creative innovation that bring together different actors and roles. However, although these new methodologies are harnessing creativity, some aspects of this new, more ecosystemic and complex vision are not clearly understood: possible barriers, how to facilitate local and operational solutions, overcoming institutional blockage, integrating new roles, etc. Methods: The incorporation of the Quintuple Helix as a driver to ensure greater coordinated participation of local actors has proven its usefulness and impact during the re-adaptation of LifeSpace (previously named Smart House Living Lab), managed by the Polytechnic University of Madrid (Spain), a transformation based on the experiences and lessons learned during the large-scale ACTIVAGE pilot funded by the European Commission, more specifically at the Madrid Deployment Site. It involved more than 350 older adult people and other stakeholders from different areas, including family members, formal and informal caregivers, hospital service managers, third-age associations, and public service providers, forming a sense of community, which was called MAHA. Results: The living lab infrastructure evolved from a single multi-purpose environment to incorporate three harmoniously competing environments: (1) THE LAB: Headquarters for planning, demonstration, initial design phases and entry point for newcomers to the process, (2) THE CLUB: Controlled interaction environment where returning users validate solutions, focusing mainly on AHA services (MAHA CLUB), such as exergames, social interaction applications, brain training activities, etc. (3) THE NEIGHBOURHOOD: Real-life environments for free and open interaction between actors and implementation of previously validated and tested solutions. Conclusion: The Quintuple Helix model applied in LifeSpace’s new vision allows a coordinated involvement of a more diverse set of actors, beyond the end-users and especially those who are not traditionally part of research and innovation processes.

	abstract = {Teaching and learning processes should be subject to continuous change due to the constant evolution of social, educational and technological environments, which ultimately results in higher levels of student engagement. The current paper describes the technological changes faced by higher education institutions as a result of digital transformation challenges. Further, transformational and transactional leadership styles’ effectiveness is regarded within the context of higher education institutions’ digital enhancements. Over time, these factors have led to contextual shifts that have disengaged students from learning and thus self-development. The current research aimed to examine how higher education institutions should apply different leadership styles within digitally transformed contexts so as to increase students’ learning engagement and reduce the risk of failure in their future developments within (inter)national labor markets. Data gathering and analysis involved a qualitative approach: an online survey was distributed, resulting in 856 responses. Through structural equation modeling, the data revealed a valid higher education digital transformation assessment tool; the results also emphasize the increased role of transactional leadership, as opposed to the traditional transformational style, within a highly digitized higher education institutional framework. Consequently, the linear relationship of students’ work engagement with leadership proved to also be enhanced by quadratic effects. The current study stresses the importance of internal and external peers in higher education performance through high levels of student learning (work) engagement through leadership and a uniformly developed digitally transformed higher education environment. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution has resulted in a need for digital businesses to participate in the digital economy. Digital human resources play a crucial role in helping businesses implement the digital transformation process. The quality of human resources is a critical factor in maintaining competitiveness and performance at the enterprise, universities, and economy-wide levels. In order to adapt to the digital era of the fourth industrial revolution, high-quality human resources capable of applying technology to production fields are required. Developing a digital economy necessitates digital human resources to deploy, organize, and operate it. However, a major challenge is the shortage of high-quality human resources in manufacturing industries. Many university graduates remain unemployed because they do not meet the needs of employers, and many workers cannot find jobs in fields related to their training. This results in waste for families and society, creating an imbalance in labor supply and demand. Building cooperative relationships between universities and businesses is a necessary and critical direction. The two sides can provide information to each other, allowing universities to develop enrollment and training plans in accordance with the needs of the enterprise. This helps universities solve their dilemmas in finding outputs for learners, while also helping businesses recruit high-quality human resources that universities cannot afford to train. This study uses an online data collection method through creating an online survey using Google Forms. The questionnaire was sent to managers at 200 small and medium-sized enterprises in Vietnam to analyze and assess the human resource needs of the economic sector to meet the development of the digital economy. The survey focuses on designing an assessment scale on business satisfaction for graduates at universities. The reliability of the scale is tested to test the hypotheses, serving as the basis for proposing solutions. The results of the study will help universities adjust training content and methods to improve the quality of human resources to serve the needs of developing digital businesses. In addition, universities need to grasp the job market’s employment needs, seeing businesses as a bridge of information and providing universities with the labor market’s current demands. The linkage between universities and businesses is necessary and brings benefits to both parties. Through this, universities will form a human resource training strategy that is both specialized and practical to meet the demands of businesses, ensuring the quality of human resource training to meet society’s needs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We envisage these innovative institutions as the imminent evolution in higher education, harnessing AI and quantum technologies to reshape academic and administrative processes. The core presumption is that through such integration, universities can achieve personalized learning trajectories, enhanced accessibility, economic efficiency, and a boost in overall operational performance. However, venturing into this new educational paradigm necessitates a thorough exploration of potential pitfalls, including questions surrounding educational quality, potential job losses, risks of bias, privacy breaches, and safety concerns. Our primary objective is to offer a balanced assessment to aid stakeholders in making informed strategic decisions about endorsing and advancing the smart university model. A pivotal factor in this discourse is the acceptance of qualifications from AI-enriched institutions by employers, a variable that may drastically redefine the education sector’s trajectory. Within the context of a comprehensive analysis of its broader societal impact, this article also delves into the ramifications of AI-driven innovations for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction. The use of digital technologies in tertiary education is one of the most pronounced modern trends. The digital component of education in the university context is rapidly developing and tends to replace traditional campus-based forms. However, the variety of aspects of this problem addressed in publications indicates that ready-made decisions on how much and in what form to introduce the online component in the practices of each specific university does not exist. The decision has to be made based on the analysis of a number of real and projected factors. The aim of the article is to identify the optimal mode of delivery for teaching English for medical purposes, taking into account the digital resources available, and to propose a new vector for increasing the efficiency of their use. Materials and Methods. The material for the paper was digital resources used in teaching English: LMS-hosted courses of Russian medical universities, Massive Open Online Courses, virtual worlds, online communities in social networks, mobile applications and relevant publications on the issues considered. The paper uses the descriptive method coupled with systematization method based on the SECTIONS model. Results. The relevance of introduction of digital tools, services, and online delivery models highly relies on, firstly, the specificity of the subject – its primary focus on the development of productive speech skills, the features of conventional communication in medicine and the associated need for learning from authentic materials; secondly, on the specifics of electronic resources intended for learning a foreign language – their suitability for developing communication skills, supporting conventional communication, access to authentic language input, opportunities of learning from mistakes, monitoring the development of productive speech skills, and monitoring students’ work with resources; thirdly, from the willingness and ability of educators to create or select the necessary educational content and combine it with classroom experience, and the readiness of the students to capitalize on it. Conclusion. We suggest a number of steps for EMP course aimed at more effective use of online learning content, such as unification, balancing face-to-face work and self-study, restructuring face-to-face class and providing continual guidance for students and faculty. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

The ability to easily and conveniently pay tuition fees using mobile banking is one of the numerous innovations and advantages of the current fintech application for its users. There is no longer a need to wait in long lines, even while paying for education, thanks to technological advancements. However, this finding sought to examine the variables that affected students’ intentions to use mobile banking (M-banking) of two significant Islamic banks in Indonesia, BSI Mobile and Muamalat DIN (Digital Islamic Network). Because of their partnership with Muhammadiyah University, everyone enrolled in this institution of higher learning will benefit. 657 people responded to the research. Smart PLS 3.3.3 is used for the analysis of structural equation models (SEM). The findings indicated that brand image has an impact on consumers’ intentions to utilize mobile banking, but perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), and trust have no such impact. As a result of this study, transactions are made very simple by the advent of sharia m-banking, but there are still technological issues that banks must take into account while providing services through mobile banking applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Currently, the state of higher education requires solving many tasks, one of which is to work with young people to identify their scientific potential, which is emphasized by the provisions of the Strategy of digital transformation of science and education in the direction of personalized approach. The implementation of this task can be carried out within the framework of the Olympiad movement and can act as a tool for assessing the scientific potential of the student. In this context, digital technologies are also an important factor. Conducting the Olympiad in a digital space provides conditions for the participation of a wide mass of creative young people from different countries, allows to assess the level of development of scientific potential, increases the information and research competence of young scientists, which determines the relevance of this study. The paper states and solves the problem of identifying the capabilities of the Internet Olympiad in Computer Science as a tool for assessing the scientific potential of students. The aim of the study is to identify the level of scientific potential of its participants according to the results of the Internet Olympiad in Computer Science. The objectives of the study determine the necessity of compiling the Olympiad tasks in the framework of the competence approach and the methodology of their assessment as the level of scientific potential; representation of the contingent of participants according to the profile of knowledge; the analysis of the results. The following methods were used in the study: analysis, comparison, comparison, design, testing, systematization of the results of scientific research. Diagnostic materials of assessment of the level of scientific potential were applied. In the present study we proposed the implementation of the process of assessing the level of development of scientific potential of students on the criterion of scientific and creative activity of personality by the tools of Olympiad movement, testing of which showed its viability.

	abstract = {Emergence of the fourth industrial revolution prompts digital transitions and transformations of economic sectors, with pressures for institutions to prepare and respond in a way that harnesses the progressive potentials of Industry 4.0 for socioeconomic growth. The purpose of this research is to evaluate core institutional change readiness factors for Industry 4.0, with focus on institutional innovation that sustains technology trajectories and supports technology use in an emerging economy. Using the Delphi methodology with a panel of 71 triple helix (i.e. university, industry, and government) experts, the research identifies, selects, and prioritizes collaboration and capability readiness factors. Initial literature review identifies 50 readiness factors and subsequent non-parametric tests find that ‘clarity of goals and relevance’ and ‘innovating competencies’ are the topmost collaboration and capability factors, respectively. Discussions on these findings imply integrated analyses based on the triple helix as well as institutional and ‘clarity-creativity’ dyadic framings for technology management studies of Industry 4.0. The managerial implications of the research centre on factor-based recommendations concerning support systems for Industry 4.0 transdisciplinary collaboration and action plans for building digital capability, in furtherance of the fourth industrial revolution.

This study aims to investigate Indonesian MSMEs and identify problems and types of knowledge transfer activities. By involving 101 MSMEs selected using convenience sampling and collected through an online survey, the hypotheses testing shows that the perception of higher drivers for IR4 promoting IR4 readiness is supported, while the perception of higher barriers to IR4 decreasing IR4 readiness is not supported. The problems faced by MSMEs in Indonesia are related to financial, human resources, marketing, operational, administrative, and organizational management. To solve these problems and enhance the readiness for digitalization, knowledge transfer activities from universities to MSMEs are needed. This study provides a theoretical contribution to the strategic management literature to fill the lack of studies on MSMEs’ e-readiness in developing countries and a practical contribution to assist decision-makers in formulating strategies to support MSMEs in facing IR4 and solving internal problems through knowledge transfer activities. © 2023 by the authors.},

Accelerating digital transformation processes, the development of information and communication technologies will replace a significant number of processes of the urban environment, urban management, living conditions, and the use of urban services. The paper aims to analyze the world experience of smart city growth, approaches to assessing and ranking cities according to the degree of development of components that define the city as “smart”, as well as taking into account such experience in building the smart city development strategies in Ukraine. An analysis of world experience has indicated that the main factor in ensuring the success of US cities as “cities of the future” is considered by most researchers to be information and communication technologies. The study considers the first attempt to estimate and build a ranking list of smart cities. Based on which invention processes, best practices, and implementation measures will contribute to their further development. IMD and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) have suggested the Global Smart City Index (SCI), which is designed to measure a balanced strategy to the economic and technological aspects of smart cities and more humanitarian dimensions of urban life. The study presents an overview of the central segments of SCI, the main aspects of the survey methodology in its formation, the division of cities into groups for the development of components of a Smart City. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Since the COVID-19 pandemic prompted numerous global changes, educational institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina were forced to adapt their educational approaches, with schools and universities implementing alternative teaching and learning practices. Thus, this study aimed to investigate students' perspectives on the digital transformation of higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including their preferences for hybrid, online, or face-to-face teaching models, their internet habits and readiness for e-learning, their attitudes and satisfaction with online learning, and their computer anxiety. The research sample consisted of 330 students studying in a variety of fields and academic years at both public and private universities. The data was gathered via an online questionnaire. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed a significant effect of students' field of study, year of study, and university status on their preferences for hybrid, online, and face-to-face classes. However, the MANOVA test revealed that the aforementioned factors have an insignificant effect on students' internet habits and readiness for e-learning, attitudes and satisfaction with online learning, and computer anxiety, all of which have an insignificant impact on student's academic achievement as determined by standard multiple regression analyses. Additionally, multivariate analysis revealed that students' preferences for hybrid, online, and face-to-face classes have a significant influence on their internet habits and readiness for e-learning, attitudes, and satisfaction with online learning, and computer anxiety. The findings of this study may aid in a better understanding of tertiary education's digital transformation and the improvement of educational policy, curricula, and instructional and learning strategies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The authors identified the main elements of the AIC 4.0 model: a digital base for decision support systems in the AIC, digitalization of production, analytics and big data, and digitalization of sales. The subjects of economic relations in the AIC 4.0 model are defined (agro-industrial enterprises, hi-tech companies promoting new technologies, the government, consumers of agricultural products, scientific and educational organizations, and financial intermediaries). The authors highlighted the conflicts of interests between subjects in developing the digital segment of agriculture in Russia. It is proved that the existing conflicts of interests form three key problem areas that hinder the implementation of the AIC 4.0 model: undeveloped information and communication infrastructure of the agricultural sector; lack of qualified personnel to ensure the introduction of IT technologies in agriculture; the imperfection of state financing and support of agriculture. The measures aimed at creating the foundations of the AIC 4.0 model in Russia are defined: the development of new standards and rules governing the process of digital transformation of the industry; the creation of new institutions for the development of innovations in the agro-industrial complex; the development of an innovation transfer system; financing projects in the field of digital infrastructure development; support for industry-specific educational institutions and stimulation of specialized research activities; expansion of forms of state support for the agro-industrial sector. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The features of the digital transformation of education are determined, the parameters of subjectivity as a conscious attitude of the student acting as a participant in globalization processes are described. Interpretations of the concept of choice and its determining factors are considered. It is assumed that students' ideas about the choice of an individual educational trajectory are characterized by partial formation and differ depending on the direction of training. 218 first-year students were examined. It is shown that students' ideas about the individual educational trajectory are quite meaningful and adequate. At the same time, the understanding of the essence of choice and their participation in its implementation are fragmented. The differences in the understanding of the phenomena of “individual educational trajectory” (X2emp.=13,9, p≤0,05) and “digital educational environment” (X2emp.=12,5, p≤0,05) by students of different directions are shown. It is described that the phenomenon of “individual educational trajectory” is understood by students quite well (less than 15% of incorrect answers), while students of technical and pedagogical directions give more correct answers than students studying natural sciences and social sciences. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study reports on the work conducted at a university in Colombia that created an evaluation instrument based on the Academic Communities of Engagement (ACE) framework (Borup et al., 2020) to examine how well the institution was supporting the affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) dimensions of engagement in its online and blended learning course offerings. This survey, the ACE in Higher Education (ACE-HE), measures indicators of the ABC engagement dimensions as well as indicators of institutional support for those elements. The survey was completed by 1,295 university students representing a broad demographic profile. Structural equation modeling found good fit for both the model of ABC engagement dimensions and the model of institutional support for ABC engagement dimensions. Institutional support for affective engagement showed strong relationships to affective, behavioral, and cognitive indicators of engagement, while institutional support for behavioral and cognitive engagement did not have the same outcome. This research provides access to both English and Spanish versions of the ACE-HE instrument. It also highlights ideas for institutions that want to improve their support for student ABC engagement dimensions in online and blended environments. Finally, several implications for making updates to the ACE framework are shared. © 2023, The Online Learning Consortium. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The shift towards sustainable and digital practices in organizations is transforming employees’ mindsets and work performance. The digital transformation in academia is leading to meaningful changes in the behaviors and responsibilities of non-academic employees within organizations toward sustainable and responsible practices. By expounding insights into these views through social exchange theory (SET), this study aims to examine the key predictors of employee engagement (EE); namely, knowledge sharing (KS), employee mobility (EM), training and development (TD), and psychological empowerment (PE) in a digital workplace scenario. A quantitative survey based on convenience sampling was conducted to validate the research framework through partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Accordingly, 205 responses were collected from the non-academic staff of universities in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Data analysis results showed that all hypotheses were significantly accepted. The impact of the model variables on employee engagement in digital transformation was found to be 75%, with employee mobility and knowledge sharing being the most prominent factors. Multigroup analysis (MGA) and importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) were additional analytical tools applied to reinforce the survey findings further and provide more comprehensive insights into employee engagement across different departments within the organization. The findings also showed the robustness of social exchange theory in digital business practices. This research offers novel and innovative perspectives on the impact of various factors (KS, EM, TD, PE) on employee engagement during digital transformation and how they mold employee behavior toward driving productive and responsible outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The competency-based learning approach arose from the Bologna signed declaration. However, a competency definition has never been easy and has been evolving and adapted over time, from indicators and learning goals to learning outcomes, which were formulated in terms of competencies. Meanwhile, the competency concept becomes discussed by pears, in particular, associating knowledge, skills, and human dispositions or attitudes into the competency definition. This information will be an essential update to the previous approaches and certainly contribute to achieving more accurate and reliable competencies information for employers and higher education institutions (HEI). This paper aims to reinforce the relevance of these concepts and suggest how each construct of “knowledge, skills and human dispositions” could be approached to formulate a competency. In addition, due to accelerated digital transformation, an example of a digital competency defined by the DigComp 2.0 framework, with proposed information regarding each of the three constructs, will be presented to consolidate this challenge. As future work, it is intended to analyze the eight different levels, and competency profiles defined by the European Qualification Framework (EQF) and assign a profile to each defined competency. In the end, it is expected altogether to contribute to achieving a competency roadmap definition. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {This article presents a general view and conceptualization of the Internet of Behavior from a social science perspective. The Internet of Behavior (IoB) is defined as a technology for machine monitoring, recognizing, and responding to human behavior (including emotion expression and biometrics). Based on the analysis of a typical case in higher education, the article forms the conceptual outline of social research on IoB by highlighting the types, possible models, and principles of IoB implementation. The study identifies three models of IoB: binary (based on checking the compliance of an individual’s behavior with the norm and his or her identification), medical (based on determining the physiological causes of certain human actions), and social (focused on identifying the features of human social behavior in addressing professional or other public problems). Monitoring, summarizing, and evaluating students’ social behavior potentially allows the implementation of new models of interaction between universities, employers, and students, based on the digitization and monetization of student engagement in learning and the responsibility of universities for the demand for graduates. The implementation of these models will lead to a profound transformation of higher education, including the digital servitization of education, the reduction of the established gap between knowledge and the social interactions associated with the generation, translation, and assimilation of this knowledge, and the inclusion of individual social behavior associated with professional knowledge in the list of those aspects of society that are subject to digitization and monetization. The basic principles of social IoB, without observance of which this technology can lead to anti-human consequences, are defined: privacy, multivalency of interpretation, continuity, relevance, and reflexivity. © 2023 Saint Petersburg State University.

	abstract = {Introduction: Interest in interactive virtual reality (IVR) is increasing due to its potential for embodied learning and group-led teaching. However, few studies have investigated the internal mechanism by which IVR technology features and learning experiences affect learning outcomes in terms of psychological and emotional value. Based on media technology models and the control value theory of achievement emotions (CVTAE), this study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the correlations among the internal elements of IVR technology features, learning experiences, and learning outcomes. It also emphasizes the role played by emotional experience in this context. Methods: The sample referenced by this study consisted of 480 college students (193 males) who were simultaneously engaged in guided inquiry and learning in an IVR-based COVID-19 pandemic science museum in groups of 10. Results: The findings suggest that presence and perceived enjoyment have a key mediating effect on the relationship between virtual reality (VR) features and perceived learning outcomes in an IVR-based learning simulation. In addition, the results indicate that presence is more strongly correlated with perceived learning effects, while enjoyment is more strongly correlated with learning satisfaction. Discussion: These findings provide intellectual support and theoretical backing for VR-based instructional design and environmental development. Moreover, this study has practical value with regard to the future large-scale application of IVR to experiential teaching, group-led teaching, and the promotion of the digital transformation and intelligence upgrading in education.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the antecedents of digital technology adoption by firms, specifically the role of strategic leader social ties such as board networks and executive academic connections in promoting digital transformation. Moreover, the authors also aim to examine the moderating effect of exploratory innovation strategy on the relationship between board networks, academic connections and digital transformation. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the panel data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2019. Through text analysis of data such as company annual report, media interaction, asset annotation and International Patent Classification, the authors measure degrees of digital transformation from four dimensions: management attention, media discussion, digital input and digital output. Further, this study employs social network analysis and instrumental variable method to examine the causal relationship between strategic leader social ties and digital transformation. Findings: The study finds that an expansive board network can significantly promote the digital transformation process of companies, in which academic connection of senior executives plays a positive synergistic role with board network. Additionally, firms with exploratory innovation strategies are more likely to utilize board networks to accelerate their digital transformation process. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the use of Chinese A-share listed companies as the sample, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other contexts. Additionally, the study focuses only on two types of strategic leader social ties and does not consider other potential antecedents of digital transformation. Practical implications: This research provides insights for governments to promote digital economy and industrial upgrading. Policymakers can facilitate industrial digital transformation by creating a supportive policy environment that encourages university–industry collaboration. By fostering academic entrepreneurship and cross-border knowledge transfer, governments can create a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation, thereby enhancing industrial competitiveness and economic growth. Social implications: This study helps to improve social welfare. By reducing production costs and enhancing customer experience, digital transformation increases economic surplus for both consumers and manufacturers, enabling society as a whole to benefit from the digital dividend. By promoting collaboration across borders and embracing a digital-friendly culture, businesses and governments can achieve long-term success in the digital age and contribute to building more prosperous and sustainable societies. Originality/value: This research makes several contributions to the literature on digital transformation and leadership. Firstly, this paper empirically examines the role of board network and executive academic connection in promoting the adoption of digital technology, filling the research gap of leadership antecedents of digital transformation. Secondly, the authors put forward a relatively comprehensive measure for digital transformation, which could help to advance the literature on digital transformation and provide a more nuanced perspective on this topic. Finally, the paper enriches the theoretical understanding of board network and executive academic connection from the perspective of social capital theory and organizational learning theory. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In modern conditions of digital transformation of the economy and digitalization of the educational process of higher educational institutions, remote reception of documents of applicants for admission to university studies is becoming widespread. In this regard, there are many heterogeneous tasks: ensuring the procedure for submitting applications for applicants; providing applicants with advice; ensuring the completeness of filling budget places. In the course of solving these problems and achieving the general goal of optimizing the recruitment of applicants for training, information and technology converge. The advising system proposed by the authors is aimed at supporting the choice of areas of study or speciality by applicants when applying for admission to a university. This becomes especially relevant in connection with the increase in the number of possible areas of training and specialities to ten. A mathematical model of the decision-making support system for the choice of training areas and speciality, taking into account the preferences of the applicant, is proposed and an example of application using the hierarchy analysis method is considered. The proposed methodology is aimed at optimizing the choice of areas of training and specialities for a particular applicant and can be implemented in the applicant's personal account. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper, employing the model integrated from Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Technology Acceptance (TAM), will examine factors affecting Vietnamese students' acceptance behaviour towards online learning. The research aims at finding out the motivating factors and measuring their influence on students' intention to accept digital transformation in learning. Based on the results, the authors propose some valuable suggestions to encourage acceptance of online learning behaviour, to enhance and apply digital transformation to higher education in Vietnam, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic, when most of the schools all over the world were forced to close. Design/methodology/approach: The research team used 913 responds' non-convenient probability sampling method, focusing on students currently studying at undergraduate education institutions across the country, studying different training majors, in different academic years. With the questionnaire designed through qualitative research, a preliminary quantitative study with 53 responses has been conducted. Based on the results, the authors completed the questionnaire then conducted a formal quantitative survey. Cronbach alpha, EFA, CFA and SEM have been used to explore the meanings of data collected. Findings: The results from analysing 913 undergraduates reveal that Attitude (influenced by Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use), IT Ability and Self-study Ability impact the intention of accepting online learning at the beginning and digital transformation in the future. Meanwhile, Subjective Norm and Financial Ability do not have any role in fostering the intent of accepting new studying mode among Vietnamese students because of IR4.0 and the low expense for online learning. Research findings are the premise for the authors to provide suggestions for students, institutions on enhancing their digital transformation process through their changing behaviours in the relationship with other stakeholders surrounding the learning process of students. Research limitations/implications: The authors found that previous studies only focused on one or two factors according to the TAM or TPB model; or have not clarified all the stages in the process of changing learning methods behaviour. Therefore, this study combined both models to analyse in more detail the above process as well as exploit new influencing factors to complete the research scale. The main limitation of this study was that the sample has been taken in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic is forcing all students to online learning, even they are willing or not. Practical implications: The research is conducted in the context of Covid-19 outspread, the society has inevitably transitioned to digital transformation, especially with the education sector. Based on the results of analysing the changing process among students from accepting online learning to their intention to change the learning behaviour, the authors proposed some recommendations for universities that build the landscape for study; for lecturers – the most important factor in connecting the students to the working world with knowledge and skills; and especially for students, who need to have actively in receiving knowledge and self-study in the era of IR4.0. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing literature related to solutions to motivate intention to accept online learning in higher education institutions. With online learning gradually being adopted around the world, the study examined the factors driving the intention to study online in emerging countries. In particular, the study focuses specifically on the case of Vietnam. This result from this study can serve as a guide for higher education institutions as a premise to develop future research directions. It may be useful for studies at higher education institutions in emerging countries similar to Vietnam; in-depth research into research subjects at higher education institutions; or study countries with cultures, customs and habits equivalent to Vietnam, etc. Finally, we are certain that the material presented in this manuscript will not infringe any statutory copyright and that the manuscript will not be submitted elsewhere while being reviewed by the Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education assessment. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Currently, worldwide and in Colombia, there is a deficit of professionals associated with these areas of science. Therefore, identifying the reasons for the low demand of students in these programs is important when the labor demand is so high. Based on this, a systematic mapping was carried out to identify the gamification strategies used to increase the levels of interest and motivation in programming in middle school students who are about to start their university program. The mapping was based on 652 initial papers, of which 19 were accepted as they met all the inclusion and quality criteria and had sufficient in-formation to answer the research questions. It was found that the most used technological strategies are associated with video games, robotics, and the practice-based learning technique. Most of the methodologies are complemented with gamification elements, demonstrating their usefulness in increasing student interest. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {the digital transformation has generated unprecedented changes worldwide, in this sense; the education sector has undergone significant changes in the way in which technology-mediated curricular content is offered, hence the importance of analyzing the role of technology. educational flexibility in the hybrid education model, particularly in the post-pandemic stage in university students, precisely, one of the effects after the confinement by COVID-19 has been the incorporation of new methodologies to education, which are mediated by the technology, where the acquisition and transmission of knowledge have been adapted to meet training needs at the higher level.The impact of educational flexibility in hybrid education is evaluated in business administration undergraduate students. Young people between the ages of 17 and 23 from the Faculty of Accounting and Administration of the Autonomous University of Baja California, Mexico, are taken as a study sample.Data processing is carried out using a correlational model of structural equations under the principal component rotation method, to define the degree of regression between the independent variable (Educational Flexibility) with respect to the dependent variable (Hybrid Education).The AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) software is used, which allows the design and validation of a structural statistical model that defines and identifies goodness-of-fit coefficients of the predictive investigative model, derived from the theoretical analysis, to estimate the hypotheses that support the results as a structural model, which helps to determine the degree of involvement of variables.The results show the preference of the students for the educational offer in hybrid modality over the face-to-face modality since it broadens the academic offer, their intellectual possibilities to achieve a better standard of living, therefore educational flexibility has a fundamental role in the adoption of educational modalities in hybrid format.  © 2023 ITMA.},

	abstract = {Fundación Jiménez Díaz University Hospital - a 651-bed teaching hospital in Madrid, Spain, which is part of the publicly funded, privately run Quirónsalud 4-H Network - developed and launched an initiative to incorporate technical innovation and an integrated practice unit (IPU) model to enhance care delivery for the more than 4,000 patients with cancer it serves annually. By 2021, the third operational year of the initiative, called the Hóspital Oncológico PErsonalizado (HOPE) project, the IPU was handling 75% of day hospital patients for chemotherapy-related care. Compared with 2018 preimplementation data, the first-to-subsequent appointment index (the number of appointments that are generated after a first appointment) was cut by 63% (to 6 from 16) (P <.001) due to the standardization of the appointments for each clinical pathway, better coordination between oncologists and nurses, and nursing empowerment to avoid redundancies in clinical tasks. The efforts have contributed to a reduction of oncologist appointments by more than 30,000 per year (to 16,280 in 2021 from 50,528 in 2018), while handling 4.25% more patients (to 1,616 from 1,549), cutting the overall process time from 10 hours over 3 days to just 2 hours in a single day at a single location, eliminating patient waiting-room time to 0 hours from 10 hours, and boosting patient Net Promoter Scores to 95 from 75. In terms of cost and efficiency, under the HOPE project model the average cost per cancer treatment has decreased 24%, and the number of patients who can receive treatment on a given day has doubled (60 vs. 30 patients). Importantly, data collection systematization and the early detection of adverse effects has contributed to a reduction in hospital admissions due to severe adverse effects or increased symptoms to 33% (525 of 1,615 patients) versus the 2018 rate of 58% (895 of 1,549 patients) (relative risk = 0.56 [confidence interval, 0.52-0.61], P <.001).  © 2023 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Higher educational institutes (HEIs) are experiencing a significant shift towards online education, which has been fast-forwarded with the global pandemic of COVID-19. The forced shift has also exposed many vulnerabilities in online education, especially assessments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential dark side of the digital transformation of examinations through the lens of university students. Design/methodology/approach: This study involves a sample of 127 university students from the fields of business and science, technology, education and management (STEM) and the key factors affecting student perception were assessed quantitatively to explore the interrelationships. Findings: Results revealed that both business and STEM students have a similar impression of the use of online examinations, and the majority still have mixed feelings about them as a replacement for physical examinations. The regrouping of the factors revealed two key dimensions, trustworthiness and apprehensible education, as key areas of student perception in the context of online examinations. Research limitations/implications: This study aims to strengthen the understanding of Kolb’s experiential learning mechanism through a discussion on the importance of abstract conceptualization as opposed to concrete experience in the establishment of the online assessment and learning space. Practically speaking, increasing investment in internet infrastructure and forming strategic alliances with important parties, like internet providers, to create uninterrupted network coverage, are an effective place to start if one wants to make sure that the process of moving to online learning is becoming more and more accepted by educators, students, and the general public. Originality/value: The online transition to higher education has seen expedited growth since the pandemic and has not given much room for many HEIs globally to adjust. The procedures and techniques implemented take a Western lens, and less attention is given to the emerging context and its context-specific characteristics in such implementation. This study takes the theoretical lens of Kolb and proposes the key learnings for a successful online transition to assessment in emerging contexts. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The role of new technologies, which stay at the center of this paradigm, is unseparated from the whole management systems in the framework of companies and value chains. Introducing new technologies should be supported by new or adapted business models, organizational systems, and human resources capable to manage them. Preparing the present and future human resources to execute their roles in compliance with the requirements of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies is a challenge for all actors involved. It requires recognition, acceptance, and development of the relationship between technology advancement and management. Our paper deals with human resource development and management in the context of Industry 4.0 introduction and implementation in the Albanian economy. It intends to highlight the role of education and management in preparing the workforce, the companies, and other stakeholders to understand and commit to new technological development, which brings manifold benefits to the country. The method used for the above analysis is a combination of a desk study and an empirical survey. The data analysis enables to point out the key factors influencing human resources development in Albanian companies. Their discussion can modestly bring some theoretical and practical implications regarding the human resources that will implement I4.0 enabling technologies in the country. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Information and communication technologies developing in all sectors of the Russian economy and the digital transformation of agriculture have a significant impact on the formation of human resources in the industry. Changing business conditions leads to the fact that human capital is becoming the leading and intensive factor in developing the digital economy. The paper focuses on the research of human resource development in the agricultural economy sector in the digital transformation of agriculture. The research methodology comprises the analysis of (1) digital modernization of agriculture, (2) diagnostics of statistical data that characterize the level of digitalization of the agricultural sector, and (3) the human resource development in the industry. We clarify the interpretation of “human resource development” and the features of its formation in the context of developing information and communication technologies, production automation, and the expanding use of digital platforms. Besides, we note (1) an insufficient level of competence in the creation and use of information and communication technologies among employees and during classes in the universities, (2) lack of professionals in information and communication technologies, (3) lack of development of information and communication infrastructure, and (4) using morally outdated platforms and systems as the main problems of digital agriculture development. We consider that the most impact of digital transformation will be on workers of general professions since the widespread use of new technologies may lead to a decrease in demand for employees engaged in activities that do not require high qualifications. Digitalization may have a smaller impact on mid-level specialists and managers, which will require them to develop new competencies for interacting with digital technologies. Thus, the main directions of digitalization of the agricultural economy sector objectively require a leading-edge human resource development and, as a result, modernization and restructuring of agricultural education in order to increase the demand for agricultural university graduates in the new economic conditions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Introduction. A necessary condition for the implementation of digital transformation at the enterprise is the formation of relevant competencies among its employees, allowing them to freely carry out their activities. The active use of information technologies, digital solutions and the reduction of routine operations form the need for the development of digital competencies of employees of enterprises, especially high-tech ones. The purpose of this study is to develop a model of digital competencies of employees in the conditions of digital transformation of the enterprise. Materials and methods. In order to develop a model of digital competencies of employees of the enterprise, competence-based and heuristic approaches were used, as well as a method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The basis of the empirical base of the study was the conclusions of 10 experts working at a large machine-building enterprise (Rostov-on-Don, Russian Federation), obtained as a result of brainstorming. Based on its results, 8 universal digital competencies of employees were selected. A matrix of their pairwise comparisons was compiled based on the results of the expert survey, in the form of a pairwise comparison on a scale from 1 to 9, and the matrices were normalized and the consistency of expert responses was checked. The consistency ratio S for all comparison parameters ranged from 0.13 to 0.19, that is, S <0.2, that is, there are no contradictions in expert estimates and no refinement of the matrices is required. A pairwise comparison of competencies was carried out for three professional groups of employees: managers, specialists (engineers) and workers. As a result, priority digital competencies were identified and a ranked list of them was obtained. Results. The study showed that the models of digital competencies are different for different professional groups of employees due to differences in the factors of intellectualization, creativity of work and responsibility. The priority of the key digital competencies selected by experts varies for different professional groups. For managers, the most priority digital competence is "communication and cooperation in the digital environment" (weight factor 0.65), for specialists (engineers) - "solving technical problems in the digital environment" (0.59), for workers - "ensuring digital security" (0.42). Conclusion. The results of the study allow us to conclude that it is important to determine the priority digital competencies of different professional groups of employees in the conditions of digital transformation of the enterprise. The use of the AHP methodology is advisable for developing a model of universal digital competencies of employees, and this algorithm can also be used to establish the priority of professional (special) digital competencies for each more specialized group of employees. The prospects for the development of digital competencies of employees are seen in the improvement of personnel development programs based on their training. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

This chapter describes the digital transformation of education at two levels of education: K-12 and higher education. The report analyzes the situation regarding the level of digitization of the education system, presents the policies aimed at the development of this process and describes the main practices implemented at the school, local and national levels for the development of intelligent education. More specifically, this report provides insights into the development of six important features of intelligent education in the Albanian context. Some progress and positive developments have been made in terms of investments made in fixed broadband networks, the creation of new agencies responsible for quality in education, the establishment of educational centers for learning artificial intelligence, etc. The chapter brings evidence of good practices of smart education implemented with students of grades K-12 by innovative teachers and cooperation with European schools in joint school projects in the field of science, culture, heritage, communication and art. The analysis of these components shows that despite these achievements, the educational system in Albania is not properly prepared to adapt to the innovations that smart education brings. The investments of the Albanian government in sectors related to education are not sufficient to meet the requirements for the development of smart education. This report identified the areas of concern for the development of smart education. Albania should make efforts for the digitization of education and introduction of innovative technologies in education, the development of digital education resources, the professional development of in-service teachers and the initial training of future teachers with digital competencies. The full implementation of the development policies the National Strategies and the significant increase in investments by the Albanian government in the education sector and in the sectors that help its development, will create the main basis for the development of smart education in Albania. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The need for sustainable production, efficient use of resources, energy efficiency and reduction in CO2 emission are currently the main drivers that are transforming the European process industry besides Industry 4.0. Since the potential of industrial symbiosis (IS) and energy efficiency (EE) about environmental, economic and social issues has been discovered, the interest in them is gradually increasing. The funding and investments for IS and EE are highly encouraged by the European Commission, while more and more policies as well as research and innovation (R&I) activities are initiated to promote European industry’s advancement towards a circular economy and CO2 neutrality. The aim is to maintain the competitiveness and economic progress of the industry. The key to build a competitive and sustainable European manufacturing industry is to create a competent, highly qualified workforce that is capable of handling the new business models coming with IS and EE requirements and digital technologies. We can generate this by identifying the skills needs and upskilling and reskilling the current workforce accordingly by delivering the suitable training programmes. Therefore, this work identifies the most critical skills needs related to IS and EE for six different energy-intensive sectors (steel, ceramic, water, cement, chemical and minerals) in Europe. The effect of the digital transformation on the skills needs is as well discussed. The identified skills are aimed to be included in vocational education and training (VET), tertiary education and other kinds of training curricula. We also identify the cross-sectoral most representative job profiles linked with EE and IS in these sectors and demonstrate the methodology for the selection process. Furthermore, we present a key tool for identifying the most significant current and future skills requirements. Also, we define the critical skill gaps of the European process industry using this tool. Once the skill gaps are defined, they can be reduced by delivering well-developed continuous trainings. We also link our work to the respectable ESCO, the European Classification of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations, to attain a common ground with other studies and frameworks, minimise the complexity and contribute to their work. Our work is developed to be an academic and industrial guideline to prepare well-developed training programmes to deliver the needed skills. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Students with specific learning disorders (SLDs) succeed in higher education if their needs are addressed appropriately. University teachers have to address all their learners educational needs to ensure efficient knowledge and practice transfer. For doing that, they can test various ways to accommodate students' needs in order to identify the suitable one for a specific group of learners.

The success and effectiveness of the use of new technologies in the educational process depends largely on the conditions for their implementation: the material and technical base, the characteristics of the educational institution, the readiness of lecturers, and the chosen technologies. Currently, one of the most actual problems is the selection and evaluation of the effectiveness of such technologies, as well as their implementation and successful integration into the educational process. The purpose of the article is to generalize and analyze the results of the experience of conducting all types of classes in the discipline “Physics” at the Don State Technical University (DSTU). This experience makes it possible to study the possibilities of using information and communication technologies and proprietary teaching methods for effective teaching. The article contains the results of approbation of digital interactive technologies and teaching methods, discusses the features of the use of these technologies and methods, provides system information and practical recommendations on their application and the methods of checking the level of adoption of the competencies by students. The results of the winter and summer sessions of the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic years confirmed the effectiveness of the methods used.

All these factors have designed new practices of management and strategic development. The key issues of stability and resistance to the challenges of war of the university’s community are rethinking the university strategy and the solidarity of national and international academic institutions, local city and state government, civil society, and businesses. The study shows that the primary mechanism of university functioning in occupation and displacement is total digitization of all processes and enhanced social communication of the university community (e.g., transition from partial to total digital document turnover and active use of social media and internet communications in the strategy of crisis communication and university’s community support). Speed-up of digital transformations and distance educational technologies of teaching in synchronous and asynchronous formats (in conditions of unstable internet connection and energy supply) ensured the high quality of the educational process. The personal values of university students and staff (resistance to the invaders (occupants), rejection of collaboration, and volunteer activities) and results of the enrolment campaign in 2022 (1037 entrants) demonstrate the benefits of perennial university activities in the context of national identity development. These also highlight perspectives of the university to form the human capital of Kherson region in general and intellectual elite in particular. © Oleksandr Spivakovsky, Serhii Omelchuk, Daria Malchykova, Alla Tsapiv, Oleksandr Lemeshchuk, 2023.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are now widely employed to overcome human-induced faults in a variety of systems used in our daily lives, thanks to the digital transformation.One example of such systems is online document tracking systems (DTS). The DTS’s reliability and preferability are enhanced by automatic document classification and understanding features. Although automatic document classification systems can assist humans in document understanding tasks, most of of them are not designed to function with Portable Document Format (PDF), which contains text, tables or figures. In this study, we investigate separate ways to efficiently classify student documents that are uploaded in PDF format and are required for university education. We propose three possible techniques for this issue. The first approach is based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and traditional machine learning methods. The second is purely on deep learning. The third one is based on fusion of deep learning methods based on entropy. The proposed techniques can classify twelve distinct types of digital documents. The validity of the proposed methods has been verified by student affairs department of Kocaeli University in Turkey. The system has not only increased the efficiency of online document uploading steps for students, but also reduced the human cost for tracking the documents. The highest F-score (94.45%) is obtained by the ensemble of EfficientNetB3 and ExtraTree. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

A novel hybrid model based on the information system success and technology acceptance models was proposed and tested. The study included 400 undergraduate and postgraduate students from four Saudi universities who responded to a questionnaire consisting of two parts and seven dimensions, with a total of 26 items. For the analysis, a quantitative approach was applied using structural equation modeling. The results displayed that information quality had no impact on the actual use of mobile learning among higher education students. In contrast, other quality factors (system quality, service quality, and satisfaction) and perceived factors (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) had a positive effect. Accordingly, this study proposed an integrated framework to assist decision makers at higher education institutions in scaffolding students to develop their educational performance by depending on mobile applications comprising high-quality factors that address their real needs. This would also enable higher education institutions to enhance their digital transformation experience, thus contributing to achieving positive learning sustainability after the pandemic. © 2023 by the authors.},

The perspective of the chapter is to examine the outcomes in higher education and how it will benefit crafting effective teaching-learning strategies by adopting the Hybrid method in meeting the educational goals. The chapter will investigate the factors stimulating hybrid learning by proposing a conceptual model incorporating various dimensions of accessibility, affordability; digital literacy; availability of hardware and software platforms and self-efficacy toward hybrid learning. Per se, the chapter will advance the theoretical understanding of the elements of the SWOC Matrix (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges) pertaining to higher education, further discussing the cross-case analysis that will relate to the components of the SWOC model. It will, further, direct how to design the strategies for the stakeholders, besides aligning the research questions with the outcomes. The challenges encountered in hybrid learning need to be addressed for the teaching professionals and higher educational institutions to evolve with the changing and unpredictable scenario. Besides, policies and practices incorporated in the higher educational landscape worldwide are highlighted, and suggestions are furnished to overcome the teaching-learning roadblocks to harness existing opportunities to make the learning successful. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {South African universities experience increased pressure to comply with and implement environmentally friendly practices. Specifically, state-funded universities need to enhance environmental management efficiency and environmental awareness. However, measuring the implementation of green initiatives in higher education takes time and effort. South African models for state-funded universities are absent, and international models are inapplicable. Therefore, this study aims to develop and empirically test the model by investigating existing theories and models and identifying potential factors for higher education. The paper determined ten initial factors from 31 environmental studies, limiting their number to five. The finally selected factors are cost of green products, awareness, training and education, top management attitude and commitment, committee for sustainable accountability, and digital transformation. This qualitative study uses a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire sampling 149 university managers. Structural equation modeling retained three of the original five factors in the model: cost of green products, top management attitude and commitment, and digital transformation. However, knowledge of the environment (SRW = 0.76) is also crucial. Ten theoretical measuring criteria are retained as valid measures of implementing green initiatives. The model has good fit indices (CMin/Df = 4.07, CFI = 0.944, GFI = 0.909), despite RMSEA exceeding 0.10. The developed conceptual model can be used to measure the implementation of green initiatives by South African state-funded universities. © Lelo Tshivhase, Christo Alfonzo Bisschoff, 2023.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation has brought radical changes in several domains. Particularly, image processing techniques have been generally used in medical, security, and monitoring applications. Image segmentation is a specific task where an image is partitioned in meaningful segments, containing similar features and properties. Its aim is to simplify the original image for easy analysis since relevant information is highlighted. These techniques are commonly used to support medical experts in detecting areas of interest in medical images. Level set method is a methodology for image segmentation, which works with minimizing energy for segmentation of the image by active contours. The areas inside each contour belong to distinct segments. In active contour-based models, the level of each contour changes according to the intensity values (region-based active contours) or the gradient variations (edge-based active contours). Here, a new edge–region level set algorithm for image segmentation is proposed which controls the curve movement based on both intensity and gradient values. Moreover, the original active contour model has been modified by considering both the mean and the variance values of the pixels’ neighborhood, instead of the mean value only. Indeed, in homogeneous regions with the same mean value could be assigned to the same segment while belonging to different ones. Since the initial curve definition is crucial for level set methods, a new methodology for initial curve detection based on Canny edge detector has been proposed. Experiments have been conducted on brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images from Whole Brain Atlas (Harvard University Medical School) datasets, part Neoplastic Disease (brain tumor) have been used. Results have shown that the suggested approach is able to accurately detect tumor regions in the images and to overcome the original active contour models such as CV, LBF, and LIF. Using semi-average filter in pre-processing stage can strengthen edges and it led to detecting more strong edges in Canny edge detector. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Deep changes are occurring in the components and forms of education as a result of the ongoing integration and development of emerging technologies like cloud computing, mobile computing, and artificial intelligence with teaching and learning, and the digital transformation of education is consistently being pushed to new heights. Simultaneously, China's higher education has concurrently reached the stage of popularization. The digitalization of higher education is related to the development quality and value proposition of higher education and determines whether it can adapt to the needs of quality diversification, lifelong learning, training personalization, and governance modernization in the popularization stage. As a result, the current and future phases of China's higher education reform call for accelerating the pace of higher education's digital transformation and guiding the high-quality growth of higher education with digital innovation. The application potential of intelligent learning systems in higher education is becoming more and more clear in this context. In view of this, this work draws from previous research and experiences to build and implement an embedded voice teaching system based on cloud computing and a deep learning model to meet the development needs of the current digital transformation of higher education. On the one hand, the new system can well compensate for the flaws and shortcomings of the current teaching means in universities and realize the accompanying ubiquitous learning by relying on the powerful storage and computing capacity of the cloud computing platform. On the other hand, this study designs a set of voice recognition methods integrating HMM+LSTM to enhance the embedded voice system's recognition performance, ultimately allowing for the voice recognition feature to be implemented in the pedagogical system. When it comes to processing audio signals, the hybrid model makes use of both the HMM's robust time processing capability and the deep neural network's robust characterization capability and generalization performance. As a result, the voice recognition rate, anti-interference performance, and noise robustness can all be significantly improved. Finally, the embedded voice system is put through its paces in an experimental setting to gauge its performance and functionality. The results of the tests demonstrate that the created hybrid model has high recognition accuracy and good noise immunity, which will be utilized as a foundation for the design and development of the final system. Meanwhile, the new system's functional modules have achieved the expected results with good stability and reliability. Trial results gathered through interviews and questionnaires demonstrate that the new system significantly enhances the intelligence and adaptability of college teaching methods and is conducive to promoting the improvement of college students' cultural literacy and innovation ability. © 2023 Yueying Li and Feng Wu.},

Which helps increase the level of digitalization. The aim of the study is to assess the level of digitalization of the Russian banking sector, taking into account epidemiological conditions. This research is based on the use of a systematic approach, covering methods of induction, deduction, abstraction, analogy, comparison, analysis and synthesis. The paper defines the concept of “digital economy”, presents some modern banking technologies, considers, analyzes and groups the results of research conducted by the World Bank, Deloitte Company, the Institute of Statistical Research and Knowledge Economy of the National Research University “Higher School of Economics”, the analytical agency NAFR, the rating agency “Expert RA”. This allowed the authors to identify the key factors that influence the acceleration of the digital transformation of the banking sector. At the end of the research, the conclusion was made that Russia has a favorable environment for accelerating the digital transformation of the banking sector, as evidenced by such facts as, for example, an increase in the number of clients who use modern remote banking channels. In addition, the current epidemiological conditions are conducive to the intensification of the banking sector in the implementation and use of modern technologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The paper aims to present the theoretical and methodological foundations for developing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) instruments in higher education within the Human-Centered AI framework and considers ChatGPT as a specific case. It is oriented toward critically analyzing scholarly literature from various disciplines to support a-disciplinary approach to utilizing AI research in higher education. The authors begin by outlining the foundations of the research, then by analyzing the implications of the “lessons” of the COVID-19 pandemic for the development of higher education in the age of AI. This is followed by an analysis of technologies such as ChatGPT that have the potential to radically change higher education in the near future. After that, the authors move on to general remarks about the prospects and challenges of using AI technologies in higher education. The relevance of the research is characterized by the analysis of the latest developments in the field of AI and their possible impact on higher education. The main results of the paper are characteristics of areas in which AI technologies can be implemented in higher education – accreditation and licensing of universities, student recruitment, teaching and learning – as well as areas in which AI technologies should not be used. In conclusion, two hypotheses are formulated, and three general and five specific conclusions about the use of AI technologies in higher education are made. © 2023 Moscow Polytechnic University.

	abstract = {The exponential adoption of new smart technologies related to digital transformation and Industry 4.0 (the 4th industrial revolution) (Lu in J Ind Inf Integr 6:1–10, 2017.) requires the ability to innovate new products which is one of the most important and desired meta-skills for individuals, firms, and economies. Nurturing individual´s innovation capability will improve the ability to deal with a rapidly changing future and to propose new products to the market. There are many models to represent individual capabilities, but this study works with the D4 innovation model to test individual’s innovation capability, it has four dimensions: defining, discovering, developing, and demonstrating. This study proposed a methodology that seeks to predict an individual´s innovation capabilities by analyzing a performance evaluation database of interns of a multinational global steel company to propose an ordered logistic model addressing whether the four Ds innovation skills predicts intern innovation capability. Data were collected using a company’s unique instrument and categorized in foundation skills and professional competencies to assess the interns’ performance. We performed multicollinearity tests, internal data consistency tests, and explanator descriptive analysis on these data. After the best model was identified, tests were performed for heteroskedasticity of residuals, model specification error, and omitted variables. The study confirmed that these attributes: discovery, developing and demonstrating, oral communication, ability to self-update, ability to establishing priorities and make knowledge explicit, foster individual innovation capability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: During the CoronaVIrus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, nursing education has been dramatically transformed and shaped according to the restrictions imposed by national rules. Restoring educational activities as delivered in the pre-pandemic era without making a critical evaluation of the transformations implemented, may sacrifice the extraordinary learning opportunity that this event has offered. The aim of this study was to identify a set of recommendations that can guide the Italian nursing education to move forward in the post-pandemic era. Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was undertaken in 2022–2023 and reported here according to the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research guidelines. A network was established of nine Italian universities offering a bachelor’s degree in nursing for a total of 6135 students. A purposeful sample of 37 Faculty Members, 28 Clinical Nurse Educators and 65 Students/new graduates were involved. A data collection was conducted with a form including open-ended questions concerning which transformations in nursing education had been implemented during the pandemic, which of these should be maintained and valued, and what recommendations should address the transition of nursing education in the post-pandemic era. Results: Nine main recommendations embodying 18 specific recommendations have emerged, all transversally influenced by the role of the digital transformation, as a complementary and strengthening strategy for face-to-face teaching. The findings also suggest the need to rethink clinical rotations and their supervision models, to refocus the clinical learning aims, to pay attention towards the student community and its social needs, and to define a pandemic educational plan to be ready for unexpected, but possible, future events. Conclusions: A multidimensional set of recommendations emerged, shaping a strategic map of action, where the main message is the need to rethink the whole nursing education, where digitalization is embodied. Preparing and moving nursing education forward by following the emerged recommendations may promote common standards of education and create the basis on for how to deal with future pandemic/catastrophic events by making ready and prepared the educational systems. © 2023, The Author(s).},

While the digitalisation of the publishing industry and the rise of new media businesses are well-documented, questions of who now produces digital education resources and who pays for them have been largely overlooked. This chapter examines the ways in which new business models are shaping universities' and students' access to educational content, distinguishing between content paid for by students, content paid for by universities and open access content whose production is sponsored by a wide range of organisations with diverse motivations. Traditional academic publishers, slow to respond to the shift to digital learning platforms, now find themselves in fierce competition with edutech firms, media companies, individual online content producers, governments and non-government organisations. The chapter concludes by observing that the proliferation of digital educational content requires academics to more often and more actively select appropriate content from a rapidly growing smorgasbord of options provided across multiple platforms, by thousands of producers, of variable quality. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

This chapter focuses on the key thrusts, discussion, insights and its relating nuances in authentic learning through digital transformation and innovations. The discussions address the process in achieving the intended learning outcomes with the adoption of these learning interventions. The chapter commences by addressing the aspects surrounding digitalization through transformative strategies and innovative learning interventions to be embedded within the eco-system. To keep up relevance and contemporariness, it is imperative for higher education institutions to move towards digital transformation in learning and learning innovations at strategic level through the relevant policies development. This thrust needs to be executed at the tactical and operational levels through the essential learning interventions to improve the efficacy of the entire learning process and transform the instructional strategies to attain the futurist learning outcomes. Next section discusses the social engineering strategy in context that primarily focuses on the behavioural and cognitive aspects of leaners and other relevant stakeholders. This deep and critical discussion enables us to appreciate the nuances involved in how learners’ function and make decisions in general as well as situational circumstances. Hence, the process enables better learning design to be formulated with a well-grounded understanding from a sociocultural dimension. That section also addresses the core thrust of learning culture and culture of learning. The type of learning culture across the higher education institutes globally allows the comprehension of the type of learners and their related learning characteristics, that may potentially be unique and rooted with distinctive values and beliefs. In the same vein, culture of learning enables the appreciation of how learners respond to design and relate to the specific challenges tied to the learning eco-system and tools based on their diverse social and cultural backgrounds, even prolonged exposure for international foreign students. Thereafter, the pedagogy as a key and holistic consideration explores into some of the contemporary twenty-first century and beyond instructional techniques and its impact. The chapter then focuses on some of the key learning notions that are critical to develop the employability (soft skills) and leadership competencies in learners to get them job-ready and nurtured for future workforce challenges. In these parts of the sections, first the functionality of the learning intervention is discussed with supporting illustrations and insights. Thereafter, the process on how the learning design could be embedded within the eco-system structure is described with supporting explanations. Next, a meta-analysis on the aspects of the learning design, types of this intervention, approaches to enhance the functionality, its impact on learning outcomes and processes and application to employability and future work. The final part of this chapter addresses the application of the interventions to teaching and learning practice in general. It recommended learning interventions with sociocultural engineering strategies. The chapter value-adds by including the part of practical implications and recommendations that will assist readers to apply thee validated strategies immediately that enables to achieve a much higher impact in terms of efficacy. The concluding thoughts in the ending section provides a strategic overview by focusing on the key thrusts of the chapter’s insights. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Pandemic effects can generate demotivation and dissatisfaction, or even discomfort, since it is an activity and structure built based on relationships, largely in face-to-face relationships, which make the pedagogical act a moment of interaction and sharing. We are particularly interested in the digital transformation pushed forward by the COVID-19 pandemic concerning higher education students. During a state of emergency, teleworking is mandatory as the work function and classes are compatible with eLearning and homework. Digital Technology looks closely at one significant facet of our rapidly evolving digital lives: how technology radically changes our lives as teachers and students. The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has paralyzed life around the world, reporting restrictive measures (that include avoidance of social interactions and the prohibition of circulation between national and international territories) that were considered non-essential activities like factories, services, and including all the educational institutions. Even Erasmus and International programs were canceled. This research project focuses on the needs and strategies, including the scaling up of investments in Information and communication technologies (ICT) education and training, and efficient management of the well-being of students and teachers. The study was carried out in a higher education institution located in the northern region of Portugal, with approximately 800 students. The methodology used was a documentary, through indicators of student satisfaction and success. Comparisons were made, for both students and teachers, with the homologous situation for the year 2018/2019, 2019/2020, 2020/2021, previous Covid-19, and after this pandemic situation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

According to WEF Global Gender Gap Report for 2021, women have greater representation in roles that are being automated; but still not enough women are entering professions where wage growth is the most pronounced (most obviously, STEM professions), and globally women face the perennial problem of insufficient access to the new technologies. Developing and deploying women who present one-half of the world's available talent has a huge bearing on the growth, competitiveness, and future readiness of economies and businesses worldwide. Globally, even though women have been less engaged in the labor market as opposed to men (55% and 78% respectively), they still represent a significant population in the workforce. Therefore we would first analyze and then implement new digital skills for women freshmen students based on digital transformation to succeed in the world of future jobs. Furthermore, a business laboratory will be used to simulate and monitor the artificially created effect of digitally encouraged leadership and entrepreneurial characteristic on economic performance within 10 and 20 years, and then we would able to compare the effects on inclusive growth. The additional goal of this proposal is to detect how entrepreneurship and leadership skills could be strengthened through education in digital transformation in order to upgrade new generations of woman leaders.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic played a relevant role in the diffusion of distance learning alternatives to “traditional” learning based on classroom activities, to allow university students to continue attending lessons during the most severe phases of the pandemic. In such a context, investigating the students' perspective on distance learning provides useful information to stakeholders to improve effective educational strategies, which could be useful also after the end of the emergency to favor the digital transformation in the higher educational setting. Here we focus on the satisfaction in distance learning for Italian university students. We rely on data comprising students enrolled in various Italian universities, which were inquired about several aspects related to learning distance. We explicitly take into account the hierarchical nature of data (i.e., students nested in universities) and the latent nature of the variable of interest (i.e., students' learning satisfaction) through a multilevel Item Response Theory model with students' and universities' covariates. As the main results of our study, we find out that distance learning satisfaction of students: (i) depends on the University where they study; (ii) is affected by some students' socio-demographic characteristics, among which psychological factors related to Covid-19; (iii) is affected by some observable university characteristics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Education is undergoing digital transformation intensified by COVID-19. In this context, gamification is an attractive alternative based on the use of elements of the games with educational purposes. However, it keeps the educational content to be learned as a central element without neglecting the “fun,” which contributing to engaging students. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the factors that affect students' engagement in an undergraduate course of Business Administration with gamified activities in remote education. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data through a survey available to students of the administration course at a private university in São Paulo (n = 671). This study used a quantitative approach, using SEM with PLS estimation and with the support of other analytical techniques. Findings: The results support all the hypotheses formulated. Those with the associated construct “competition” obtained the most robust relationships, which denotes that competition is an essential element in gamification. Despite being supported by the results, “network exposure” influencing engagement is one point of attention to improving teaching strategies. Research limitations/implications: Graduate schools could implement this type of gamified activity, evaluating whether students enrolled in higher degrees would willingly engage in a learning activity considered “less serious.” Practical implications: Higher education institutions can benefit from this study by understanding that gamification is presented as an active methodology that increases students' engagement in teaching. Originality/value: This research addressed gaps in the factors that affect students' engagement with gamified activities, proposing an alternative theoretical model to those present in the literature. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The development of a cognitive model of learning for electronic educational systems was stimulated by the identification of a wide range of problems in solving, suggests the existence of grounds for making managerial decisions at the university and poses the challenges of digital transformation. A software solution has been developed with the help of which the analysis of students’ achievements is carried out using an electronic portfolio and data on the states of students’ cognitive parameters. The data obtained as a result of processing allows you to form individual trajectories, as well as pay attention to problematic moments in learning. The cognitive model of a student for a digital profile takes into account, in our case, cognitive abilities, mental and socially determined characteristics, the ability to reflect, as well as the current level of personal experience and professional competence. Based on the presented model of cognitive transfer, the choice of cognitive indicators of students for use in a digital profile is substantiated. In addition, the possibilities for the formation of personalized events for students in various fields of the University activity in accordance with their learning path are considered. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Hence, the present study aimed to identify positive cores of faculty in their successful post-COVID-19 performance. A qualitative methodological approach was deployed, with the Netnography method, complemented with elements of positive psychology, appreciative inquiry, and management of formative potentialities. The online community consisted of 1238 university teachers from 10 Latin American countries, who participated for two months in an appreciative interview as an asynchronous journey of constructive proposals, for the active co-construction of post-COVID-19 success factors. The findings reveal multiple affirmative topics grouped into nine positive cores, identifying two target categories: digital transformation and technological innovation, as well as the processes directly associated with their dynamization. Finally, the epistemic implications of the findings in theory and practice, and their relevance in the creation of a formative agenda of positive change for Latin American Higher Education, are presented. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Against the background of multiple and simultaneous global socio-economic shocks, coupled with digital transformation and the green transition, regional resilience triggers new structural transformations. The more complex processes that need to be addressed now require the usage of complex integrated tools. The novelty of the integrated approach is the combination of the models and the synthetic spatial–temporal picture offered. The quadruple helix, or 4Helix, model puts Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) at the nexus of generating regional digital resilience. We posit a new mindset and behavior of human capital to reinforce innovation and knowledge production and transfer. We explore, using the Romanian national case, to what degree the spatial 4Helix model generates regional digital resilience as a positive externality of adoption of the ‘new normal’ digital education. We analyze this process in three steps. (1) We determine the spatial distribution of HEIs at the Romanian county level (NUTS3). (2) We calculate the regional static and dynamic resilience indexes (at NUTS2) as the outcome of the method for multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) by each region’s digital economy as well as individual and regional wealth, social digital use and social digital connectivity dimensions. (3) Lastly, we provide the result of overlaid maps and radar charts (using HEIs number and spatial coverage and each region’s static and dynamic digital resilience). These three classes of digital resilience models of 4Helix by region indicate a generalized failure in adopting digital education in Romania. The study contributes by adding a powerful tool to explore the complex processes or phenomena and generating an integrated perspective using a pre-existing framework. In doing so, it enables researchers to better understand and address society’s needs, co-create knowledge and solutions together with the end-users, maximize the impact of these solutions, optimize resources usage, and increase the transparency and accountability of the decision-making processes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation has been inevitable in all socio-economic fields, including higher education. Recently, under the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have to change their entire teaching systems to online learning to ensure their students' learning is not interrupted. Thus, it is essential to study how universities’ students, educators, and administrators perceive online learning in different countries. To this aim, this study investigates the factors affecting university members' preference for online learning in Singapore and Vietnam. Using a cross-country sample with a sound theoretical framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we found that each member group in the university was influenced by a different weight of factors. Specifically, students' preference for online learning is most affected by their technical skills. Meanwhile, educators and administrators are influenced mainly by the perceived usefulness of online learning and practice conditions, respectively. We further conducted multi-group testing and confirmed the certain separation in online learning preferences of observed objects between the two countries. Overall, this paper enriches the literature on online education, and has important implications for educational policymakers and university stakeholders both during and after the pandemic. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {The global digital transformation of the economy requires a new look at the information basis for making managerial decisions on the problem of uneven distribution of universities across Russian regions. It involves the creation of a data bank on key issues of Russian higher education. One of these indicators may be the subjective reasons for the attractiveness of territories for applicants/students/graduates in terms of the significance of images of the university and city of study, as well as factors influencing educational migration. The goal is to show, using the example of a separate case, the role played by the images of the university and the city in the choice of a university, adaptation and postgraduate migration of students from other cities (coming from Russian cities and villages). The theoretical framework of the study is built by synthesizing the theories of “spirals” about the third function of higher education, and the theory of the image of the territory in relation to educational migration. The analysis involves statistical data on the socio-economic situation in Russian regions that attract educational migrants, and the results of a survey of out-of-town students of Kazan Federal University. The study found that both the university and the city are equally important bases for educational strategies for the majority of applicants. During their studies, they, like those who came to study only because of the university or just because of the city, consolidate the image of Kazan as a student territory with rich infrastructure and quality life, a sense of belonging to the capital of Tatarstan, positive assessments and a desire to recommend it to friends for moving. However, the reasons for educational migration and the perception of Kazan do not affect the postgraduate plans of students. Regions that are able to attract applicants and retain students after graduation - Moscow and the Moscow region, St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region, Sverdlovsk and Novosibirsk regions - benefit from Tatarstan due to the fact that they offer more favorable living conditions and a larger range of offers on the market work for young professionals. The practical significance of the work lies in the position on the importance of combining the policies of shaping the images of the university and the city, not only to attract talented youth, but also to improve the third mission of Russian universities in terms of their inclusion in the development of urban activities among students, the use of the intellectual potential of higher education for socio-economic development of territories. © 2023 Moscow Polytechnic University.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework to support the use of digital formative assessment in higher education. The framework is informed by key principles and approaches underpinning effective formative assessment and, more specifically, by approaches to formative assessment that leverage the functionalities of technology. The overall aim is to provide a structured conceptualisation of digital formative assessment that supports the planning of lectures and other teaching and learning activities in higher education classrooms. At the heart of the framework, as presented in this paper, is a 12-cell grid comprising 4 key formative assessment strategies (sharing learning intentions and success criteria, questioning and discussion, feedback, and peer- and self-assessment) crossed with 3 functionalities of technology (sending and displaying, processing and analysing, and interactive environments). These functionalities of technologies are used as the basis to integrate digital tools into formative assessment for effective teaching and learning processes. For each cell in the grid, an exemplary digital formative assessment practice is described. This paper highlights the framework’s potential for enhancing the practice of digital formative assessment and its significance in light of the ongoing digital transformation. This paper concludes with suggesting a programme of research that might be undertaken to evaluate its utility and impact in higher education contexts. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Amid the digital transformation catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, academics, including those in the School of Education (SoE) at a university in South Africa, engaged digital technologies in furtherance of their educational objectives. In many university classrooms, the textbook remains a crucial resource in disseminating content knowledge, and academics tend to rely on the textbook for teaching and assessing learning. While paper-based textbooks have been the focus in the developing world for decades, e-textbooks became a more viable option with the transition to online learning. Studies have shown that e-learning via e-textbooks can be used to enhance learning through interactivity and engagement. However, the extent to which the SoE academics were able to engage digital technologies to enhance meaningful learning in their e-textbook pedagogical practices remains unclear. This chapter thus sought to explore how accounting academics adopted e-textbooks in their online pedagogical practice. Framed by the technological acceptance model, a case study design was adopted. Qualitative semistructured questionnaires were administered to all four accounting academics in the SoE to understand their views on using e-textbooks in the virtual learning platforms. Our findings revealed that the participants continued to rely on paper-based textbooks in the virtual learning spaces but considered the peculiar features of e-textbooks useful in teaching accounting. They further acknowledged internet self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, hedonic factors, and the cost of e-textbooks as crucial determinants in adopting e-textbook pedagogy beyond the pandemic era. In a context where most of the students are from poor socioeconomic backgrounds, this study has implications for the SoE as it strives to provide quality, affordable education for all amid a digital transformation. Insight from the study will assist publishers as they tailor their e-textbook offerings to suit the needs of the academic community while contributing meaningfully to scholarship in e-textbook pedagogy, where knowledge is currently scant. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

This article focused on exploring the factors that affected undergraduate students’ satisfaction when participating in a short-term online course at a key pedagogical university in the South of Vietnam. This was a cross-sectional study with 1720 pedagogical students. The study aimed to explore and understand the factors affecting the satisfaction when studying online courses of pre-service teachers to prepare them with experience and knowledge for future online teaching. The results showed a positive correlation between perceived ease of use; perceived usefulness, information quality; system quality; instructors dimension; support service; subjective norm; perceived behavior control with students’ satisfaction when participating in a short-term online course. This is the basis for research team to continue to develop and improve the quality of online courses and provide a theoretical framework on factors affecting learners' satisfaction when participating in a short-term online course for students in countries with higher education online education systems similar to Vietnam. In addition, this study expanded our understanding of the factors that influence the preparation of pre-service teachers to meet the requirements of digital transformation and international integration in e-learning educational trend from a developing country’s perspective. © 2023 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved.

	abstract = {The digitalization of higher education (HE) institutions and relevant issues have attracted the attention of many educational stakeholders. ICT has become a subject of high importance in every context, particularly in the workplace; thus, a principal goal for universities and schools is to prepare future professionals capable of dealing with problems and searching for effective solutions by their digital competence as a key skill. In this regard, a new framework is developed to evaluate the main drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions (HEIs) in the era of industry 4.0. The developed framework is proposed a decision approach that can effectively use the presented information to make decisions of high rationality. This framework is applied to compute the subjective and objective criteria weights, and it is used to assess the preferences of organizations. An empirical case study to evaluate the main drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs is taken. According to the findings, the most significant drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0 are developing, updating, and adapting a curriculum (0.0425), integration of digital technologies for universal education (0.0420), and cloud computing (0.0419), respectively. Hence, the evaluation results also show that the option higher education institution (HEI)-4 has the highest overall utility degree (1.845) over different drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0. Also, comparison and sensitivity investigation are made to show the superiority of the developed framework. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The authors emphasize the primacy of pedagogical innovations and the auxiliary role of information technologies providing the technological basis for the creation and application of new pedagogical practices. The analysis of changes in the educational process in the context of the expansion of the digital educational space and the possibilities of distance technologies leads to the conclusion that the use of the traditional one-way monologue transmission of knowledge on modern digital platforms is ineffective. The paper proposes the methodology based on the self-study underpinned by the mankind achievements, the creation of student's own system of knowledge, when he gives his meaning to the world and changes him/herself, developing his/her creative abilities. This methodology has been proven to work and tested in practice. The article presents an experience of the Belarusian State University (hereinafter - BSU) in the development and implementation of the concept of creative education, the deployment of a large-scale program for the introduction of distance technologies. The practical steps for the implementation of this program are described, such as the development of a new educational and methodological literature, the creation of an interuniversity portal “Methodology, content, and practice of creative education”, the implementation of the full-time distance training program “Technologies of heuristic education in higher education: teaching methods through discovery” and the project “Online Learning Workshop”. The main quantitative indicators of the effectiveness of the digital transformation of the educational process at BSU are analyzed. The authors describe the information infrastructure of BSU, which ensures the implementation of innovative pedagogical technologies: telecommunications infrastructure and a “cloud” data center, an educational process management system integrated with corporate systems and services, its own video conferencing system, an integrated automated information system developed by the university. © 2022 Moscow Polytechnic University.

	abstract = {Most countries around the world, in pursuit of efficiency and readiness for digitalization, ensure the interaction of government, business and the population, spending significant funds on science and higher education. The digitalization of the economy is also a consequence of the innovative activity of universities, but not only as centers of education or science, but also as centers of innovation creation. To get a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of such countries’ spending, the authors analyzed all 132 countries from the Global Innovation Index (GII), which is a widely recognized indicator of the innovativeness of the economy and characterizes, among other things, the readiness of countries to digitalization. A distinctive feature of this study is the use of the GII as a kind of tool to measure the level of innovativeness of the country’s economy, which is determined in the current environment by digital transformations, as well as the identification of factors influencing it. The article uses calculated indicators that are not directly included in this rating, which allows to reduce dependence on it and increase the level of reliability of the results. The study revealed a strong correlation between the amount of public spending per student and the level of innovativeness of the economy. The top 20 countries in the world were determined by this criterion, it is possible to adopt their experience in the development, where digital technology is a tool that contributes to the growth of innovation of the economy of the modern state. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This new approach, known as the Innovation-driven University, applies criteria and indicators through the University Performance Metrics (UPM). The UPM has three key characteristics: radical mindset changes, holistic innovation facilitations, and ecological and social norm encouragement. Instead of past transformations' entrepreneurial approach, the innovation-driven method redefines universities as ecosystems that innovate for others rather than in isolation. An innovation-driven model facilitates the demands of entrepreneurial spirit, innovative approaches, digital transformation needs, personalized education, and ecological and social norm promotion. It is a new framework to measure innovation in higher education institutions (HEIs) that integrates criteria that respond to the demands of the 4IR. This article assesses UPM's ability to evaluate the 4IR readiness of 10 HEIs in Vietnam.

The COVID19 has increased the situation and is making visible the need for a real and profound transformation in the digitization of educational organizations. At a scientific level, digital transformation processes have been approached in a fragmented frame. To provide a holistic vision, the policies are working for the comprehensive development of digital competence. We are talking about the European Framework for Digitally Competent Educational Organizations, and its implementation in Andalusia through the Educational Digital Transformation. The aim of this work is exploring how this process of digital transformation occurs from the perceptions of the members of the educational community. To do this, it is designed a qualitative and longitudinal research. The cases were selected based on their level of commitment and participation in the Digital Transformation Program. A semi-structured interview was used for data collection. In the results obtained, aspects related to equipment, teachers and students are identified. As well as the emergence of digital culture as a key factor. In this regard, it is possible to think that, to a higher level of digitization of the organizations, corresponds a greater digital culture. As well as a model of cultural transformation with a favourable predisposition to the digitisation of these. © 2022 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE. All rights reserved.},

Rather than the impact of COVID-19, many higher education institutions (HEIs) are on the verge of insolvency due to a lack of digital transformation readiness and poor business models. The bleak financial future many HEIs will face while others may be forced to close their doors completely will erode HEIs’ ability to fulfil their societal responsibilities. However, HEIs that have survived and maintained their operations anticipate the transition to online learning or the effects of any economic crisis, including university closures in the short, medium, or long term. The entire educational ecosystem was forced to transform its operations quickly and entirely to an online teaching-learning scenario in just a few weeks. Notably, HEIs that have long offered online courses worldwide can easily transition to digital teaching and learning when necessary. The second roundtable session’s result of the International Higher Education Conference, organized by INTI International University on March 31 2022, was used to organize a Delphi method to identify further factors that positively impact HEIs by COVID-19. The importance of these factors was then determined using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance.

	abstract = {Digitisation and digital transformation are not only a topic of the media, but are also taking place in companies. The digital transformation affects the most diverse fields, from procurement to sales and from organisation to strategy development. This task requires the commitment of every company management and cannot simply be delegated. This book aims to help managers and entrepreneurs to set up structures in their organisation that allow them to approach the digital transformation systematically. The topics covered range from the configuration of digitisation strategies and new management roles such as the Chief Digital Officer to the importance of IT infrastructures, HR management and corporate culture as enablers of digital transformation. A simple framework serves as an orientation framework that structures the management tasks and clearly summarises the various concepts and instruments. In the 2nd revised and expanded edition, the focus is on organisational aspects, in particular the role of start-ups for the digital transformation, the design of the so-called Digital Innovation Units and the role of the CDO. Secondly, the design and management of digitisation projects is considered in more detail. And thirdly, the concept of digital transformation is further specified and delimited. In addition, the advancing technological development is taken into account. "Prof. Thomas Hess provides a concrete overview of many important aspects to be considered in the digital transformation of companies. Clearly worth reading." Stefan Winners, Chief Digital Officer at Hubert Burda Media "Beyond the buzzword - Finally someone manages to systematically untangle the chaos surrounding digital transformation. With his book, Thomas Hess truly establishes the guardrails for managing digital transformation projects. While others promise much and deliver little, Thomas Hess gives the reader a design framework rather than a patent remedy." Dr Christoph Steiger, former board member and CDO of Hoffmann Group "Clearly more than just another book on the topic of digital transformation! With exciting insights from science and practice, Thomas Hess provides a toolbox for digital transformation. Relevant for business and relevant researchers." Prof. em. Dr. Dr. h.c.

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution brings new opportunities and challenges to the development of countries worldwide. As an important development power, engineering science and technology has become critical means for a country to stand out in the fierce international competition, the international engineering construction competition, and the core factor to improve the international right of speech. Higher engineering education is the main path for engineering science technological transfer and development. Hence, determining how to make a scientific evaluation of the comprehensive quality of higher engineering education, improve the higher engineering education quality, and train engineering innovative talents are keys to improving the comprehensive national competitiveness. Based on the outcome-based education (OBE) theory, studies concerning higher engineering education quality evaluation in the European and American developed countries were reviewed first. In this study, a comprehensive quality evaluation index system for higher engineering education was built through a survey of intelligent manufacturing and engineering education experts from 14 universities from applied science and engineering areas in Jiangsu Province of China. Moreover, the comprehensive quality of higher engineering education in these 14 universities was evaluated comprehensively using the AHP-TOPSIS method. Influencing factors of higher engineering education quality were ranked by using a barrier model. Results demonstrate that the established evaluation index system is operable. The judgment matrixes in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) all pass the consistency check and the weight of teaching management is the highest (0.2950). The comprehensive engineering education quality ranking of universities is consistent with that of the third party. Teaching management is the first barrier factor in the barrier model and more attention has to be paid to disturbances of administration factors in universities against the improvement of higher engineering education quality. The obtained conclusions have very important values to updating the engineering education personnel training system, digital transformation, and improvement of engineering majors like intelligent manufacturing, as well as improving the innovation ability of engineering talents. © 2022 School of Science, IHU.

	abstract = {One of the most active consumers and generators of information is the education, where the intellectual and moral potential of future generations is formed. Currently, there are abundant examples of inaccurate, distorted or primitive information presentation in the Internet space. The purposes of the study are to identify the risk factors and threats of information security in higher education; to give a theoretical justification for the urgent necessity of information security at engineering university; to provide successful socialization and personal development in modern society within the era of digital transformation. The study is based on the analysis of psychological, pedagogical and sociological sources, empirical methods: observation, conversation and survey. It allows to study the complex system of potential and real threats to the information security of an individual and society and to assess the main information objects from the point of view of security of students and teachers. The experiment was carried out at Kazan National Research Technological University. The respondents were first, second and third year Bachelors of the Faculty of Plastics and Composites Processing. The respondents were asked to assess the presence of digital safety components in the educational space. Analyzing the data of students’ answers, one can state a high degree of understanding of threats and negative consequences in the digital space, as well as the prevailing desire of students to gain knowledge, recommendations for identifying destructive forms of influence on the Internet, to get acquainted with the strategies for the development of critical thinking and self-development. The system of higher education should focus on ensuring digital security of the subjects of the educational process, preventing harm from dangerous information influences on the cognitive, mental, moral or physical state of the individual. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: to consider the possibility and expected effectiveness of introducing digitalization tools into the educational process using RPA technology to improve the quality indicators of educational and related processes. Methodology: to achieve this goal, we use the capabilities of system analysis, which allows us to combine and investigate the factors of the external and internal environment of the university that determine the quality indicators of the educational process, as well as the need and prospects for the introduction of digitalization. In turn, the synthesis of the data obtained and the conclusions made it possible to identify the main tool of digitalization and justify our choice. Moreover, the author’s argumentation was based on the results of qualitative research methods: focus groups and expert assessments, as well as methods of systematization and visualization of the data obtained. Findings: the analysis of the requirements of legislation in the field of education, the realities and trends in the development of information technology, as well as the actual practice of organization of business processes in an educational organization, allowed us to conclude that the introduction of digitalization in the educational process implies, on the one hand, a positive effect. Thus, scientific and pedagogical workers will no longer have to devote a significant part of their working and free time to the preparation of teaching materials, which will lead to an increase in the creative potential of teaching staff, motivation to work, the level of dissatisfaction, stress from paperwork and intra-university bureaucracy will decrease. The coordinating and controlling functions of the university management, readiness for all kinds of control and supervisory measures will also be optimized. On the other hand, the study revealed the possible risk levels of implementing RPA and the strength of their negative impact on business processes. Originality: the presented study is characterized by a high degree of originality, which is due to the nature of the study itself: the authors set a goal, the achievement of which involves solving specific pressing problems, rather than theoretical analysis and obtaining hypothetical conclusions. The research is based on specific processes, their subjects and objects in the organization under study, applied research methods that are situationally suitable for this particular problem. Conclusion: the presented analysis made it possible to argue for the need to introduce digital transformation technologies into the work of modern organizations, including the field of education since this will largely optimize routine processes at the university, improve the quality and efficiency of the formation of methodological and organizational components of the educational process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The researchers have found that the success of digital transformation is strongly influenced by the digital culture within an organisation, as well as transformational leadership and organisational commitment to provide adequate resources. For this research, a tool was developed to measure the level of digital transformation readiness by measuring both the digital culture determinant and leadership readiness along with organisational commitment. The tool was used to investigate 36 institutions of higher education in Indonesia. This study provides data concerning higher education readiness levels with regards to digital transformation towards a smart campus. It is hoped that as a result of this research, institutions will be able to determine their level of digital transformation readiness and subsequently develop appropriate strategies, so that they can be digitally transformed. © 2022.

	abstract = {Higher education is a key pillar in constructing new knowledge economies for the 21st century, and the digitalization of higher education is a central focus area for national authorities. Visionary discourses from authorities state that the decision-making authority for digital strategies should be centralized to the domain of management. Digitalization is, however, driven by key features of modern technology and may also lead to the transformation of traditional educational methods as well as educational practices. Since the university contains several disciplines, different strategies can be used when products or processes within the disciplines are digitalized. It is important to consider in the ways that different disciplines can proceed to digitalize their educational practices. Based on these interests, our research question is as follows: how do digital strategies in higher education emerge, and how do they align with the educational context? Through a qualitative case study with interviews, participation in workshops, and document analyses, we investigated two digitalization efforts in the fields of medicine and law. We found that the two classical disciplines’ strategic approaches differed substantially. Based on the findings, our main contribution is a digitalization model with two archetypes, namely digital transformation strategy and digital innovation strategy. The model highlight the main object of the respective strategies, but also the institutional reaction to digitalization efforts. An implication from our study is the demonstration of how specific faculties adapt digital strategies to educational practices. This may sometimes lead to the transformation of educational practices, while other times more incremental moderate changes may be implemented. From a practical point of view, policymakers, politicians, educational management, and professionals need knowledge and expertise about the implications of digital strategies for educational practices. Our contribution, we propose, strengthens the understanding of strategies within digital infrastructures in higher education. © 2022 by the author.},

However, experts and managers worried about Blockchain's unintended systematic influences and seriously asymmetric information which may put the financial system and economic institution at risks. Meanwhile, students having start-up intention in Fintech have not yet been equipped with sufficient knowledge and skills for their startups dream in prior to entering the market. In this study, authors combined several research methods of desk-review, sociological survey, Google doc interview with supports of Linkert 5 level and SPSS 25 to study the influences of Blockchain technology on university students' start-up intention in Fintech. The study identified three major factors, the legal awareness, personality traits and education, influencing students' startup intention in Fintech.

We employ the Ordinary Least Square Regression method on nationally representative data known as the Cambodia Post-Secondary Student Survey 2020 with a sample size of 1,338 individuals. Results support the Technology of Skills Formation concept that parents, especially the mothers, play a crucial role socially and financially in influencing individuals' technology readiness which is measured by the Technology Readiness Index, a composite measurement hardly affected by any short-lived disruption. Moreover, parental education is negatively associated with children's technological readiness holding the wealth effect constant.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In response to the negative COVID-19 impacts, it is urgent to support digital transformation plans at all levels of educational online activities. Fundamental it is also to support new inclusive digital pedagogical methods and skills for a resilient free adoption of digital tools for academic teachers (digital integrated learning, advanced multimedia, but also hybrid and interactive new methodologies, 3D, VR, holographic tools, etc.) and allow effective use for students, including participants with fewer opportunities: physically impaired (deaf, blind, paralytic), cognitive impaired and low-income students. This to create the condition of a more EU integrated strategy to consent the proposal for a Council Recommendation on the enabling factors for successful digital education by 2022–2025. We are following and improving the recommendations of OECD and UN, of EU Future Government 2030+, of EU’s strategy for e-Skills in the 21st Century, of KES international network and of FOME - Future of Management Education international scientific alliance. Also, some new EU Directives will imply a real digital revolution in educational processes and learning skills. So digital technologies have made this transition possible: surely, there have been a number of e-learning platforms for some years now, but their role has only in the last months gained massive relevance concurrently with the pandemic global situation. Only a few EU Universities are already ready for good quality distance learning, with tools for course management, including live sessions, interactive teaching and collaborative activities. Most EU Universities had to cope with the emergency situation that called for a quick organizational and cultural rearrangement and a change of learning strategies, which perhaps represented the most difficult step for teachers and students. Digital technologies are becoming very relevant at the EU level for teachers and students. However, the current limitations on the movement of people and teaching hours may restrict this type of delivery. For this reason, the described EDU-GATE initiative is providing a detailed European multi-sectoral analysis indicating the comparison of current situations of teaching digitalization (As-Is and To-Be analysis), together with a transversal needs’ analysis. Also, a smart innovative curriculum, including the most advanced educational design and delivering techniques, has been created for the improvement of teachers’ skills. Almost 12 innovative multimedia e-modules have been prepared, permitting effective learning activities and to share best practices in the EU. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Increased demands from industry for specialists in engineering and in general on STEM jobs in Europe and all over the world need a more diverse skills profile comprising both hard skills and core transversal competences like digital skills and soft skills. Preparing engineering and STEM candidates with non-technical skills, including skills such as critical thinking, idea generation and interdisciplinary ways of working, seems particularly important and a necessary task. Regardless of the domain of soft skills in any workplace, education at the colleges and universities is no stranger to this fact. However, despite the growing interest in incorporating soft skills in engineering studies curricula, there is no common agreement in many aspects. For example, it is not clear which soft skills should be selected, how they should be taught, or how they should be assessed. On the other hand, there are also differences depending on the university institution involved or the geographic area. At present, the recent push towards digital transformation that society now requires has increased the number of frameworks and lists of soft skills. Another characteristic of these skills is that they need to be acquired in an active way, which has become a challenge that has given rise to multiple pedagogical approaches. The objective of this paper is to present our investigations to identify the common soft skills that are occupationally required in the job market in Europe and beyond, and academically fostered for engineering graduates. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The absolute majority of publications about changes in higher education resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic focus on the problems faced by students. They fail to articulate the position of university faculty members who are concerned about their dwindling role as a result of the digital transformation of education. Since 2020, the Institute of Social Analysis and Forecasting at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration with the support of the Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education has conducted a monitoring study of the attitude of university faculty members to the changes taking place in higher education. The present article is based on the results of three research waves (non-random, administrative, two-stream samples) conducted in April 2020 (N = 33,987), June-July 2020 (N = 27,484) and April-May 2021 (N = 26,334). An overall positive trend is observed in teacher attitudes: the peak of discontent about the introduction of distance education has passed, and the attitude to online learning has become calmer and more level-headed. Most teachers continue to express unconditional support for traditional in-person learning, however. The article takes a close look at the attitude of teachers to the digital transformation of higher education and analyzes their narratives. Teachers believe that the most promising aspect of the digital transformation of universities is the use of blended learning technologies that combine the benefits of classical and innovative teaching methods. The article identifies risk factors and further opportunities for digital innovations in higher education. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation has increased the demand for skilled Information Technology (IT) professionals, to an extent that universities cannot satisfy it with newly graduated students. Furthermore, the economical downturn has created difficulties and scarcity of opportunities in other areas of activity. This combination of factors led to the need to consider requalification programmes that enable individuals with diverse specialisations and backgrounds to realign their careers to the IT area. This has led to the creation of many coding bootcamps, providing intensive full-time courses focused on unemployed people or unhappy with their jobs, and individuals seeking a career change. A multidisciplinary group of higher education teachers, in collaboration with several industry stakeholders, have designed and promoted an embedded systems programming course, using an intensive project-based learning approach comprising 6 months of daylong classes and a 9 months internship. Having finished two editions of the programme, a questionnaire was presented to the students that finished successfully, in order to evaluate the long-term benefits to graduates and companies. This paper presents a brief discussion of the programme organisation and pedagogical methodologies, as well as the results of the questionnaire, conducted following a Goal–Question– Metric (GQM) approach. The results demonstrate very positive outcomes, both for graduates and companies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The type of study is mixed and applied with a quasi-experimental design. An analytical system based on eight stages was built, which are: user characterization, business requirements, storage, technological infrastructure, feature engineering, computational processing, visualization and decision making. The analytical system was validated with data from the SQL Server management system of the academic services office and fifteen Excel files from the admission office oriented to academic data in a higher educational institution. The use of various algorithms such as support vector machine, random forest, k nearest neighbours, and neural networks, among others, was applied. The evaluation of the results generated by these algorithms allowed us to identify the support vector machine algorithm with 94.21% accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Digital technology changes the organizational structure of traditional firms, creating opportunities for entrepreneurship. These modifications are known as “digital transformation” (DT). In addition, higher education institutions (HEIs) are altering the form of student–lecturer and teaching–learning interaction, where DT restructures the bases of soft skills (SS). Since SS are difficult to measure, this study aims to analyze the bases of SS for digital academic entrepreneurship, responding to the following research question: What are the bases of digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed? Design/methodology/approach: An extensive integrative review of the literature revealed that due to the editable, re-combinable, reprogrammable and generating nature of digital technology, the basis of DT, it is necessary to develop SS in higher education students. Findings: The results show that the competencies can be developed considering three major groupings: (1) individual characteristics, (2) cultural characteristics and (3) knowledge sharing. Practical implications: Since SS are not easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital tools can help and support this type of process. It is suggested, therefore, that those in charge of HEIs should use the pillars presented in the framework proposed here to guide their institutions' strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate an entrepreneurial mentality in students and develop digital academic entrepreneurship. Originality/value: An innovative conceptual model of digital academic entrepreneurship is proposed from the perspective of SS, where the interlinking of those groupings is permeated by DT, as well as the disruptive role of digital technology, leading to the development of an entrepreneurial mentality in HEI students. © 2022, Ana Garcez, Mário Franco and Ricardo Silva.},

An amalgamation of information, communication, and artificial intelligence is taking place, as well as the cross-fertilization of a wide range of concepts, referred to as the digital transformation. While the discussion on how to operationalize the new intelligent systems of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is still going on; the dominant characteristics of the fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 – going beyond producing goods and services for profit – requires all to think and act differently. As a result of the convergence phenomenon, the boundaries between different disciplines are eroding, necessitating a thorough discussion on what engineering education should be like in the future. In this paper, after presenting a brief history of engineering education, the recent paradigm changes are discussed, which essentially stress that skills must prevail over degrees to deal with challenges posed by the trends of the fifth industrial revolution. Later, before concluding the paper four strategies are presented such as lifelong learning and transdisciplinary education (1), sustainability, resilience, and human-centric design modules (2), hands-on data fluency and management courses (3) and human-agent/machine/robot/computer interaction experiences (4). © 2021},

	abstract = {The article offers a critical analysis of the impact of digital technologies on higher education. The digitalization of higher education is discussed in relation to broader socio-cultural and political and economic challenges: globalization, commercialization, socio-economic inequality and ethical issues of technology application. Using this approach, it is demonstrated that the rapid digitalization of higher education during the pandemic has activated already existing points of tension and problematic trends: the 'McDonaldization' of education, new managerialism in higher education governance, increasingly consumerist attitudes to learning, and the development of the elite education model. Secondly, digitalization has introduced new risks related to the growing influence of global technology companies, online modes of the commodification of learning, the digital divide as a factor of educational inequality, and new ethical challenges. If these risks are not addressed in a timely manner, digitalization may jeopardize the creative self-organization of educators and students, hinder the development of diverse and ethically responsible practices of technology use, and further unbalance the higher education system and increase its dependency on commercial technology companies. To mitigate the risks, it is recommended that the academic community scrutinize the educational principles and ideas that currently guide the development of educational digital technologies, and that it should take a proactive stance on how these technologies should work and which pedagogical and ethical principles should inform their design. It is likewise essential to support the development of alternative models of digital technologies for education to be designed in partnership with all stakeholders in higher education. © 2022 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Therefore, this paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model for digital information management of "government - industry - academia - research - consumer"under the guidance of the government and consumer collaboration, led by industry entities, analyzing the strategic choices under the tripartite interaction, and investigates the influencing factors of the digital information management strategy choices combining with numerical simulation analysis. The simulation results show that the digital information management of enterprises requires the government to provide policy guidance, capacity support and macro-control. Specifically, the government's willingness to participate will affect the strategic choices of subjects whose willingness to participate is at a moderate level; when government participation cannot cause a significant drop in costs, it is still difficult to establish a coordination mechanism for digital information management; the higher the level of openness of basic data, the stronger the digital information management willingness of enterprises to participate, etc. Finally, relevant suggestions are given based on the results.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a transition of enterprises to a digital business environment, restructuring business processes using innovative opportunities. Higher educational institutions in a short time transferred educational processes to an online format using distance learning technologies (DLT) in their work. Today it has become obvious that such a format presupposes not so much a change in the way the participants interact, but the development of new methods for implementing processes using modern technologies of interaction, control and communication of students. The paper provides an overview of the results of a survey of students in connection with their experience in gaining knowledge using digital educational platforms. The survey involved 57 second-year students studying in the field of management. The data obtained allow asserting that a consequence of the change in the format of the educational process was the deterioration of the education quality. Among the main reasons are outdated teaching methods that do not correspond to innovative learning processes, lack of training for participants (both students and teachers), insufficient infrastructure of universities and financial difficulties, personal characteristics of the teachers, peculiarities of intragroup interaction, lack of understanding of the status of a specialist trained in online format and a number of other factors. The results of the survey are recommended to be taken into account by universities when developing innovative educational methods for the implementation of processes using DLT. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The processes of automation, big data, the digital environment, global crises, and the interconnectedness of international society are changing common technological patterns and the educational system. Among the essential features of competitiveness of teachers in higher education are mobility, digital competencies, adaptability, participation in scientific networks and projects, and continuous acquisition of new technological skills. For this reason, teachers must continuously develop their professional skills to remain competitive and create professionals in higher education. Current conditions are fostering global demand for teachers who produce pedagogical and scientific developments. This article aims to solve the problem of defining the structure, content, and requirements of scientific and methodological support for higher education teachers’ competitiveness in a digital world in the context of global challenges and risks. Theoretically, the problem is defined by the need for new approaches to explaining the concept of teacher competitiveness and the need to develop a psychological and teaching methodology for training and developing teacher competitiveness. In practice, we conclude that researchers must develop personal, professional, procedural, and technological enhancements to support higher education faculty competitiveness in a digital world. © 2022 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas, CY.},

	abstract = {This study explored the impact of utilizing mobile-assisted language learning to help EFL university students promote their learning performance and support a sustainable self-directed learning experience while developing digital literacy and technology competence. The global pandemic and spread of COVID-19 have accelerated the convergence of technology in the classroom in response to an emergency where the sustainability of education is at stake. With the progress of digital technology, a variety of smart mobile applications have been applied in English language learning and teaching. The use of those technologies can encourage language learners to practice selfdirected learning beyond the classroom settings, which is essential for motivated and autonomous learning. Mobile phone applications have great potential as effective pedagogical tools with features such as accessibility, manageable interface, and multifunctional components. However, the use of mobile-assisted language learning for sustainable, self-directed learning outside the classroom has been relatively under-researched. In this study, EFL university students engaged in mobile-assisted language learning that could make their learning more sustainable and independent outside of the classroom. The data of this study show that students’ attitudes toward participating in mobileassisted English language learning were affirmative. The results show that incorporation of mobile applications into language learning could foster learner motivation and make their learning more sustainable and entertaining than simply using the conventional instructional methods. Participants of this study stated that major benefits of experiencing mobile-assisted learning for their English study were ease of access to learning contents, portability of the learning tools, flexible and self-directed learning environment, better interaction, and improved self-efficacy in English learning performance. The pedagogical implications of the study are discussed, and instructional strategies are suggested to share ideas about a more pertinent learning environment in the era of digital transformation. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract = {In dealing with the global pandemic, many sectors have extensive crisis management research to lean on but education has been virtually overlooked. With the recent global pandemic, the role of Internet of Things has been greater than ever before as most of economic activities have moved to online platforms. Education sector is one of the most heavily impacted where the immediate effect of lockdowns has been closure of schools, universities, colleges. Lockdowns sprung on everyone and everything, not just mode of studies, but also wellbeing, course effectiveness, student tuition, teacher’s income. Despite the ever-presiding change resistance in academia, digitization of education took place almost instantaneously. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as an accelerator for education digital transformation utilizing a wide variety of digital solutions to facilitate classroom teaching and learning. Through a survey of 913 Vietnamese students, this study seeks to explore the digi-tization of education in Vietnam and its implications on Vietnamese students. The author expects to explore the students’ readiness for digital transformation and their utilization of IoT in higher education through a quantitative regression analysis. Results show that students’ readiness for digital transformation is positively corre-lated with all four independent factors and in the following respective order of impor-tance: COVID-19, self-study ability, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Digital innovations are becoming increasingly important both in the global and in the Russian economies. It is also obvious that most types of innovations, both traditional and digital, are developed not within the framework of one organization, but in digital innovation ecosystems that unite several organizations and various stakeholders related to entrepreneurship, such as universities, research centers, business associations, industrial and infrastructure institutions. The data obtained in the process of studying the features of the formation and development of leading Russian innovation centers was used as a practical basis for the study. As a result of the study, the authors were able to identify four groups of factors influencing the transformation of innovation management within the digital innovation ecosystems of Russian companies.

	abstract = {A Smart University (SmU) consists of a number of traditional and smart components. Undoubtedly, it has the distinctive properties of a Smart University, which are discussed in detail in V.L. Uskov and his colleagues’ works. A Smart University is constantly increasing the level of its smartness through the improvement, development and implementation of Smart Component (SmC) projects. In the process of Smart University development, big data has been accumulated. So, the management processes are characterized by the active use of analytics tools. It’s primarily done by smart analytics for work with this data. A Smart University uses the tools of intelligent systems, artificial intelligence technologies, neural networks and other Industry 4.0 technologies. The study deals with the issues of improving the management of Smart University projects through the information infrastructure development of project management. It is shown that the process of making managerial decisions in a Smart University should be built on approaches and technologies based on big data. The article also represents the conceptual vision of a projects’ formation portfolio for the development of Smart Components in a Smart University. It is shown the algorithm for using digital analytics in making management decisions based on big data. The originality of the study is based on the development of approaches to assessing the level of big data use in project management. A set of qualitative indicators has also been developed. It characterizes the level of Big Data technologies use in a management system of Smart University projects. The proposed developments can be applied to manage the university digital transformation and the transition to the concept of smart education. Expert methods were used for modeling. The proposed tools have been tested in the activities of Russian universities during the pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The current study aims to examine how students’ intentions to use 4.5G mobile phones are affected by the social-economic factors of performance expectancy, cost, effort expectancy, and social influence. This study is based on the perspectives of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The central assumption of this study is that when students use 4.5G mobile services to source information at university, their academic performance is likely to improve. From eight private and public universities in Malaysia, 2117 students were enrolled in this study. We investigated the effects of gender and awareness as moderators on the relationships among the variables of interest. The findings showed that social influence and performance expectancy positively affected university students’ intentions to use 4.5G mobile phones. The researchers conducted a multigroup analysis to confirm the moderating effect of gender among the underlying relationships in the model. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that, unlike awareness, gender did not moderate social influence, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, or the cost of students’ intentions to use 4.5G mobile phones. The implications of the proposed approach, considering the digital transformation concept, could be a topic for future research. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews the digital transformation (DT) management technology for an organisation at the stage of evaluating its digital maturity. A characteristic feature of DT consists in profound changes in approaches to management, corporate culture, external communications, as well as an abrupt increase in efficiency. The relevant goal is to estimate the progress of DT and record the indicators of this progress in order to improve the efficiency of the further DT, as well as secure the transparency of an organisation in terms of its digital maturity. We present the developed system of estimating the digital maturity of an educational organisation. The objective of estimating digital maturity has been formalised thanks to analysing the existing approaches to validation of the digital maturity for an organisational object. The utilisation of the model developed is demonstrated on the example of higher education in the Russian Federation. The novelty of the given study is in introducing the mechanism of integral estimation calculation of digital maturity into the digital maturity evaluation methodology. The weights in this modified weighted average estimation are assigned to indicators of DM pronouncement level in such a way so that the integrated estimation could be transformed into a 100-point grading scale. The technique is adaptive and can be applied not only in educational organisations but also in organisations in other spheres of activity. © 2022 Anhalt University of Applied Sciences.

Despite the extensive norm creating and conducted research on the problems of training and accumulation of human potential in the functioning of the industry, there are still issues in the activities of educational organizations that require discussion and decision-making. The purpose of the work is to study the mechanism of managing the development of education in the context of global transformational changes affecting the development of social and economic relations. Using the methods of systemic, monographic and historical approaches, economic analysis and expert assessments, the indicators characterizing the activities of institutions of general and vocational education are considered, the key vectors of training students in undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate studies are identified. The key position in the training of personnel of “basic” universities, as implementing educational programs, taking into account the promising economic specializations of Russian regions and the peculiarities of the spatial development of the country, has been determined. The necessity of priority attention to the training for working in STEM-areas, the use of progressive forms of education in conjunction with the practical activities and research work of leading federal and research universities has been substantiated. Based on the generalization of Russian and foreign experience, recommendations are formulated to improve the training by using the “6i” model to manage the functioning of universities during the transition to the sixth column. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the concept of the technology acceptance model (TAM), this research adopts structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse data collected from 795 undergraduate students who have gained the experience of online courses in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The results of this study indicate that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are significant predictors of students' perceived enjoyment in online courses while perceived obstacles are not its direct antecedents. The correlation between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness is also affirmed in this study. Besides, differences are found based on students' characteristics including gender, grade and academic major. Research limitations/implications: As online learning turns education to be learner-centred, it is crucial to have a better understanding of students' perceptions toward this advanced learning method. The insights found in this research may be of interest to educational administrators, aimed at achieving the digital transformation success in education which may adapt to the current trend of Industrial Revolution 4.0. Originality/value: According to the best of the knowledge, this research is the first to explore the effect of the group of three predictors including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived obstacles on the students' learning enjoyment toward the online learning method, especially in the context of Viet Nam. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Emergency measures to continue university activities during COVID-19 have affected student performance and satisfaction, especially in regions with scarce resources and little experience in virtual education. Online education is a new process for most universities in the interior of Peru, where digital transformation was null or incipient, affecting the learning effectiveness. The current research is based on a survey conducted in February 2021 in order to evaluate students’ perception about the quality of emergency remote learning measures introduced during the pandemic in 2020. The survey was distributed through the institutional emails of students and the responses were collected anonymously, following a systematic sampling. A total of 1029 respondents representing 38 professional careers of public referent university of the Central Andes of Peru participated in this survey. The survey focused on 28 criteria linked to the didactic, technological and psycho-affective dimensions. It aimed to collect scientific evidence to propose improvements in this pedagogical transition process. Associations between the variables studied were determined with χ2 tests and Spearman correlations, and to determine the regression coefficients and Odds Ratios of the variables associated with the highest degree of satisfaction with the emergency virtual classes, logistic regression was used. Thirty percent of students showed dissatisfaction, perceiving problems in the design of class materials, feedback, e-learning support, development of practical and laboratory activities, and teaching performance; 25% were satisfied and 45% had a neutral perception. About 30% felt frustrated with their virtual classes. The highest OR for a higher degree of satisfaction fell on the impact of courses for professional training, student care services, support for online learning, and feedback mechanisms. To improve the quality of virtual learning in the post-pandemic period, the study recommends to transform the face-to-face model to a virtual or blended model, taking advantage of the variety of information, and communication to improve the quality of higher education. © 2022, Edam.

	abstract = {Online education is an inevitable trend in the era of digital transformation, but effective implementation is not easy. This research was conducted to understand the relationship between interaction and the perceived progress of online learning, under the mediated effect of satisfaction. Data was gathered from 223 full-time learners at nine universities in Vietnam, using Google Forms. Since the study had a mediating variable, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method was used. The results show that learner-lecturer interaction, learner-learner interaction, and learning content have positive impacts on online learning satisfaction. The findings of this study reveal that satisfaction has a positive influence on overall progress, which means that, as satisfaction increases, perceived progress in online learning interaction increases as well. Based on the findings, the authors suggest using the flipped classroom model to increase the interactivity and effectiveness of online teaching. This study sheds new light on the relationship between interactions and perception of progress in online education at private universities in Vietnam's southern region.  ©Authors.},

	abstract = {The vital role of motivation becomes even more evident when considering the digital transformation of learning and teaching environments, especially with the effect of the pandemic. Basic psychological needs and emotions, which have not been comprehensively examined together despite their important roles in motivating, draw attention. Accordingly, this study aims to reveal the psychological, emotional, and individual variables that influence the pre-service teachers’ intention to use technology, and to evaluate and validate the predictive power of a proposed model. The technology acceptance model formed the basis of the proposed model, and the model was extended with the self-determination theory (competence, autonomy, relatedness) and a framework of emotions (enjoyment, playfulness, anxiety, frustration). Data were collected online from 591 pre-service teachers studying in 10 different departments of a state university. In data analysis PLS-SEM, PLSpredict and multi-group analysis were performed. The results revealed that the model explains 79.8% of the intention and that the predictive power of the model is high. The relationship between competence and perceived ease of use represents the strongest relationship in the model, and the most influential construct on intention is enjoyment. These findings suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation play a major role in technology acceptance, especially during the pandemic. In addition, innovativeness, which is related to technology use and motivation, had various moderator effects on the relationships. Findings indicate that the model, which offers a motivational approach based on basic psychological needs and emotions, provides rare information and has high relevance for the field. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

To achieve an integrated approach to assess the readiness of a higher educational institution for digital transformation in the form of a multi-criteria analysis of the university activities and development. Methodology. The approach of educational institutions rating assessment, based on a hierarchical criterion, called the Index of Information and Communication Technologies Development (hereinafter ICT Index) is proposed in the work. The approach is considered to be an analogy of the Networked Readiness Index developed by the Information Technology Group at Harvard University's Center. Findings. It is proposed to follow the approach of the ICT Index calculating as a universal metric for the digital transformation level assessment of educational institutions based on the Networked Readiness Index, namely to adopt abstract categories of top-level criteria and to average the values of hierarchical nesting. Originality. The approach originality consists in the weight coefficients input at any level of the hierarchy. In addition, the approach provides a flexible choice of the Index resulting scale for the most understandable interpretation of the results, as well as the universal mathematical apparatus development for Index calculating. The proposed mathematical apparatus can be easily modified for any specificity of an educational institution and its criteria. Practical value. The use of the ICT Index for all educational institutions in Kazakhstan will solve the problems of automating processes to ensure training and expanding the technological capabilities of educational institutions for modifying the forms of education at the state level by bringing the assessment indicators of all objects to a single scale. © Zhanbirov G., Toktamyssova A., Mussabayev B., Tanachova Y.S., Zheldak T.A., 2022.},

Trends in educational transformation and results of the survey demonstrated a need to improve the existing LMPAELS content model. Subjects of the survey were students from three Latvian universities. As a result, following attributes were added to the course described in the content model: competence, preconditions, and outcomes. Attributes included in a description of a learning object were – skills, knowledge, deadline, and learning time. The improved content model gives an opportunity to create different types of learning objects depending on the deadline, including organizing independent study hours. Introduction of a deadline and learning time for learning objects allows a learner to plan and control their own learning process. The use of different learning object types allows a more detailed description of the learning process components, and improves the adaptation offered by the system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Aim: Our research concentrates on the sustainable development and digital transformation of educational systems. This topic has gained the special attention of researchers and policymakers in recent years due to the wide spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the digital surge that can be observed all around the world. This digital surge, which can also be called a digital revolution, was further deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the massive closure of schools and universities and the deployment of online and home learning. Methods: We use data obtained from researchers and lecturers at universities and higher education institutions in the Czech Republic and Russia between September 2020 and March 2021 to perform ordinal regression analysis. This allows us to test the relationships between effectiveness as a key factor of creativity on one side and motivation to look for new ways of teaching and research during and after the COVID-19 pandemic on the other. Results: Overall, it appears that there are still many obstacles to the digital transformation of educational systems that might be embedded in the structure and the scope of today's educational institutions. We demonstrate that, at present, universities and higher educational institutions are undergoing ràdical change driven by the need to digitize education and training processes in record time, and that many academics lack the innate technical skills for online education. Nevertheless, it appears that young and motivated academics and researchers are keen on embracing new technologies and support the digital transformation of educational systems. Conclusions: Our results might be useful for decision-makers and stakeholders in universities and higher education institutions for designing their strategies for the digitalization of educational systems. © 2022 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

	abstract = {Introduction. The relevance of the study is determined by the active implementation of digital technologies in all life activities of people, including in the education system. Reforming the modern school in a digital environment has both a positive and a negative impact to the subjects of the educational process. The purpose of the study was to identify the relationship between the attitude of students and teachers of Russian universities to digital transformations of education and the characteristics-motivational sphere of the subjects of the educational process, namely the degree of significance and satisfaction of deficit and everyday needs. Materials and methods. The empirical study involved 150 cadets and students of the Voronezh Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia and the Siberian Fire and Rescue Academy of the State Fire Service of the EMERCOM of Russia; 51 lecturers from a number of Russian universities. To study the need-motivational sphere of the subjects of the educational process, the «A. Maslow's Motivational Questionnaire» was used. Revealing the attitudes of students and teachers to the digital processing process was carried out using the scale modified for research purposes, the Technological Readiness Index (TRI). Results. It was revealed that motivators and inhibitors of digital readiness of subjects of the educational process are associated with the significance and satisfaction of different needs. Students' optimism and innovativeness correlate with the significance of existential needs (respectively, remp= 0.201, remp> r0.01; remp= 0.237, remp> r0.01) and their realization (respectively, remp= 0.197, remp> r0.05; remp= 0.223, remp> r0.01). At the same time, inverse relationships were found between discomfort and satisfaction of scarce needs (remp= -0,160, remp> r0.05), as well as distrust of digital technologies and the realizability of existential needs (remp= -0,163, remp> r0.05). Among teachers, motivators of digital readiness correlate with the realization of deficit needs (optimism: remp= 0.285, remp> r0.05; innovativeness: remp= 0.298, remp> r0.05). The innovativeness of teachers in relation to the digitalization of education correlates with the significance and satisfaction of existential needs (respectively, remp= 0.276, remp> r0.05; remp= 0.353, remp> r0.05). Conclusion. The study confirmed the hypothesis about the correlation between the personality traits of the need-motivational sphere and the attitude of the educational process to the digitalization of education. In view of the fact that a significant part of students and teachers experience discomfort and insecurity associated with the possible consequences of digital processing in education, the integration of traditional and online education systems, the preservation and development of humanistic ideas of pedagogy in the digital era are important in the educational process. © 2022 Perspectives of Science & Education.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 crises forced and accelerated digital transformation in higher education institutions. Acceptance of the adoption of digital technologies in those institutions as well as their digital and educational readiness and resilience are important key success factors for this transformation. The objective of this study was to explore challenges, attitudes, opportunities and lessons learned of digital transformation in times of crises at the university level from faculty members’ and students’ perspectives. The study used Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical framework. In order to achieve the objective of the study a qualitative method was used. A total of 14 focus group interviews with 62 faculty members and 37 students were conducted in a mid-size university in Palestine. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data gathered from the focus group sessions. Results revealed many challenges toward digital transformation including technical and pedagogical infrastructure, social conditions, ease of use of software, digital pedagogy and online assessment. There are positive attitudes towards the availability of online resources and digitizing theoretical courses. However, students and faculty members still feel that they are not prepared enough for online education and expressed negative attitudes when digitizing practical courses. In order to achieve effective online teaching and learning, good preparation is a must for both students and lecturers which is not followed in actual delivery. Results also revealed several opportunities and benefits of digital transformation, namely, flexibility and the opportunity to develop new technical and educational skills. Researchers recommend carrying out this study in other universities and within different social and cultural contexts and applying mixed approach methodology for validating emerged results.

Those that are able to efficiently transform themselves into digital organizations in a short time and have a high capacity for self-adjustment to the new socio-economic situation achieve competitive advantages. Many universities in Thailand have committed to a strategy of transformation into digital organizations. This research was conducted to study the factors behind the success of the digital transformation of Thai universities, using a quantitative research method. The data were collected using a questionnaire administered to 495 administrators from 6 Thai universities, of whom 303 were high-level administrators, 174 middle-level administrators, and 18 low-level administrators. Statistical analyses and confirmatory factor analysis were performed on the data obtained. The results revealed 6 factors that influence the success of digital transformation in the context of Thai universities: 1) digital culture, 2) digital strategies, 3) management process, 4) organization leaders, 5) digital technologies, and 6) staff. The results are useful for academics and organizations’ administrators or authorities to set clearer directions to propel their operations towards digital success. © 2022 by the authors.},

The study of the features of quality management at the stage of digital transformation is carried out on the example of universities, for which the risks of reducing the quality of the result when switching to remote work are the highest.The aim of the study is to determine the conditions for ensuring the quality of the digital transformation of the university, taking into account the need for re-engineering of the main processes and a radical change in the competency profile of teachers and support staff. To analyze the features of quality management at the stage of digital transformation, the research task is decomposed into three areas. In each direction, the author's innovative design technology was used, which was adapted to the tasks of applying the process approach and principles of quality management in practice (1), designing the technology for preparing management teams for the implementation of digital transformation projects (2), and developing a mixed training on the basis of changing the system of labor rationing and ensuring the quality of remote work management (3).These approaches have proven their effectiveness in projects related to the development of digital transformation strategies and programs for their implementation, business process reengineering, and involving personnel in solving strategic problems. The study showed that a necessary condition for ensuring the quality of digital transformation is a deep study of the process model. Participants of educational projects received a double effect in the form of the developed elements of a quality management strategy at the stage of digital transformation and the competencies necessary for this. The results obtained confirmed the importance of a systematic view of digital transformation.  © 2022 IEEE.},

This study explores the challenges of rapid digital transformation arising during the pandemic in the higher education context. This research used the Q-methodology to understand the nine challenges that higher education encountered, perceived differently as four main patterns: (1) Digital-nomad enterprise; (2) Corporate-collectivism; (3) Well-being-oriented; and (4) Pluralistic. This study broadens the current understanding of digital transformation, especially in higher education. The nine challenges and four patterns of transformation actors serve as a starting point for organisations in supporting technological choice and strategic interventions, based on individual, group, and organisational behavioural levels. Moreover, five propositions, based on the competing concerns of these challenges, establish a framework for comprehending the ecosystem that enables rapid digital transformation. Strategies, prerequisites, and key factors during the (digital) technology development process benefit the cyber-society ecosystem. As a practical contribution, Q-methodology was used to investigate perspectives on digitalisation challenges during the pandemic. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Universities have implemented various strategies to help faculty develop digital teaching competence and although institutional frameworks and initiatives exist, there is not enough scientific literature describing them. This research aims to analyze the characteristics and results of training strategies to develop the DTC in the university environment. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in the main databases, following the PRISMA methodology. Starting with 322 documents, and after the filtering phases, a total of 20 documents were analyzed in depth. The results indicate that most of these strategies have an impact on areas such as professional competence and the use of technologies in the training process. Likewise, most of the strategies are based on isolated actions, such as courses or seminars, although collaborative, experiential and reflection-based methodologies emerge; aspects that are highly valued by the teaching staff. In conclusion, it should be noted that, beyond isolated actions, it is essential to have appropriate institutional strategies to enhance the value of the digital teaching competence and promote a true digital transformation. © 2022 Universidad Autonoma de Madrid.

	abstract = {Introduction. The Strategy for digital transformation of science and higher education (2021) adjusts the relevant vector in the context of comprehending the urgent issues of achieving “digital maturity” as an indicator of the national goal of “digital transformation” of the entire social sphere. It means that information technologies and digital educational resources are mandatory components of digital transformation of science, theory and educational practice. Cybersport is one of the innovative human activities; a kind of sport focused on the development of intelligence and leadership qualities of young people; a special educational potential of young people, acting as a leading factor of their social education. The purpose of this research involves characterisation of information technologies that are efficiently used in the development of cybersport as an educational potential of students. Methodology and methods. To analyse the possibilities of using information technologies (hereinafter – IT) in the development of cybersport, the method of generalisation and analysis of sources exploring the issues of embedding IT in the educational process and various spheres of life activities, as well as the method of questioning, were applied. The survey covered 60 respondents – students of Bunin Yelets State University. The research instrument comprised six questions, both with the choice of ready answers and those involving independent reasoning. Results. The analysis of the questioning results led to the conclusion that there is ample scope of using IT in the development of cybersport, both in terms of improving educational outcomes and extending the educational potential in general. The study showed that the awareness of the respondents was in line with their good knowledge about cybersport (50% of the respondents chose the most complete definition of this concept). The awareness of the advantages of cybersport and the purposefulness of the respondents’ participation in games showed the average level (25% of the participants note the benefits of cybersport associated with the absence of age restrictions; 25% of the respondents participate in games in a targeted way). The awareness of the disadvantages of cybersport is also at an average level (20-33% of the respondents). The realisation of personal qualities potential as a goal of engagement in cybersport shows the average level (the highest result is 37%, when the survey participants selected the given goal out of the proposed ones). The educational goal of cybersport was formulated correctly by 52% of the respondents, which is also indicative of the high level of awareness of the substance of cybersport. Among the two most important qualities required for a cybersport athlete, determination was chosen by 100% of the respondents, while 50% of them pointed to self-regulation, which is also an evidence of the high level of awareness of the given sport and the purposeful involvement in it. The prevailing high and medium levels of awareness indicate at broad possibilities of using cybersport as a ready educational platform for the development of soft skills, logic, adaptability, reaction, basic IT-skills, foreign languages, etc. Scientific novelty. The research results (its first part) made it possible: a) to characterise information technologies in terms of their importance for efficient development of cybersport as an educational potential for young people; b) to conclude that cybersport activities promote intellectualisation of educational process; improve teamwork skills, various communications building skills; form healthy lifestyle habits, compliance with daily regime, proper nutrition, etc. Practical significance. The performed research makes it possible to determine the cybersport development vector in the context of educational potential of young people and improvement of the methodological framework of the explored process in the practice of psychological and pedagogical follow-up and digital transformation of education and social schooling. © 2022 LLC Ecological Help.

Higher education institutions (HEIs) compete amongst themselves, both locally and globally, in terms of student and staff recruitment, government funding, and research funding. In addition, networking with companies and other organizations is a key part of HEIs’ strategies and actions. We consider the steps that HEIs have taken toward digital transformation, the drivers behind digital transformation, and the factors that affect HEIs’ management strategies. Although the digital transformation process started over 30 years ago, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major driver of digital transformation in Finnish HEIs. The results of our case study show that an HEI’s funding is of critical importance and provides the ground for setting the performance indicators in HEI management. Finally, climate change and sustainability are factors that will further affect the higher education system. © Proceedings of the International Conference on E-Learning 2022, EL 2022 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2022, MCCSIS 2022.

The goal of this study is to scrutinize a proposed research model for predicting factors that influence student’s behavioral intention to use e-learning system at Begum Rokeya University, Bangladesh. The study used quantitative approach and developed a research model based on several technological acceptance models. In order to test the model, a survey was conducted to obtain data from 262 university students. SEM-PLS, a multivariate statistical analysis technique, was used to analyze the responses to examine the model, factors, structural relationships, and hypotheses. The result shows that ‘perceived usefulness’ and ‘perceived ease of use’ positively and significantly influenced by ‘perceived enjoyment’. Furthermore, ‘perceived usefulness’, ‘perceived ease of use’ and ‘facilitating condition’ have a significant impact to predict behavioral intention to use e-learning. The results of mediation analysis show that ‘perceived usefulness’ and ‘perceived ease of use’ have mediating effects between the predictors and the outcome. Finally, ‘facilitating condition’ have a remarkable moderating effect to predict the student’s behavioral intention in using e-learning. The findings have a noteworthy empirical implication for educational institutions to introduce e-learning system as one of the teaching and learning tools. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The world is changing, and, among other factors, digital transformation is assuming a key driver in the paradigm shift. Challenges appear, and solutions are needed, especially in what concerns human wellbeing and innovative approaches. Higher education can have an important role in this ongoing process, as it can supply an open, transformative platform for collective knowledge creation through research, education, innovation, and culture. In fact, it can shape the future of a knowledgedriven society if it works closely with its stakeholders and tries to meet their needs. Implementing new educational methodologies where students can participate and have a more dynamic and active role can be an effective answer. Combing formal education with non-formal education seems to develop the needed 21st -century skills. This article aims to share some best practices already developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave, based in Portugal. It reflects students' perceptions of their participation in nonformal projects during their formal education. Students seem to get more involved, more committed, and empowered, while they are learning by doing and contacting real cases in real conditions. The results seem to reinforce the notion that there is a strong relationship between learning, innovation, and social innovation. Students feel more holistically integrated into the world and with a lot of developed skills that will differentiate them in the future, in a more sustainable approach. © 2022 Authors.

	abstract = {The problem of the modern system of higher education in Russia and the world is the search for an adequate and high-quality digital model for enhancing professional training in higher education using the remote access system. The pandemic has exacerbated and hastened finding an answer. Russian universities have found an answer in the use of digital educational platforms. One of the most widespread and adequate to the needs of higher education was the «Yuryat» platform. The goal is to assess digital educational activity in Russian universities from 10/26/2020 to 10/25/2021. The research is based on the primary data of «Yuryat.Statistics» and published empirical data. Statistical and quantitative methods were used to study the problem., in particular, the integral index of digital educational activity (IDEA) was used in general form, calculated as an additive convolution of its constituent sub-indices. In turn, each sub-index Ii allows quantitatively characterize different types of digital activity when using the resource, they were calculated using the formula for linear scaling of Pi values. The main result of the study was based on the indicators developed by the authors on the state of digitalization of higher education in Russia from 10/25/2020 to 10/26/2021. conclusion about the lack of digital educational activity of universities according to the data of «Yuryat.Statistics». The average IDEA value = 0.082 means that the average digital activity is 8.2% of the maximum level equal to 1. The country is characterized by low student activity in the use of tests and media resources (ISKK and IUEM sub-index), as well as in the creation of digital courses (IPDC sub-index) on average across Russian universities The study carried out in this work on 318 universities in Russia made it possible to conclude that there is high interuniversity differentiation in terms of the level of development of digital transformation of the educational process, both in terms of individual characteristics and on a territorial basis. The results of the study proved that the main centers of digital transformation of higher education are Moscow, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. It is obvious that the system of professional training in the country in the university sphere is faced with the question of strengthening work on the formation of technologies and platforms for remote access. © 2022 LLC Ecological Help.

Currently, the concept of Industry 4.0 is well known, however it is an extremely complex, as it is constantly evolving and innovating. It includes the participation of many disciplines and areas of knowledge, the integration of many technologies, both mature and emerging, but working in collaboration and relying on their study and implementation under the novel criteria of cyber-physical systems, provide solutions for the development and improvement of the industry. This study started with an exhaustive search for scientific information that allowed us to abstract the concept and reorganize the industry 4.0 paradigms to define a solid starting point. Finally, in this work we present two proposals for schematic analysis of Industry 4.0 that will help academia and other companies that need to start similar studies. The results will allow us to perform an alternative, more objective and technical analysis, and to know the functions and scope of the integrating technologies, to achieve a better collaboration of each area of knowledge and each professional, considering the potential, scope and limitations of each one.

	abstract = {The Northern Michigan University (NMU) online campus, fondly known as the “Global Campus,” is now 5 years old. Launched in 2016, this online and distance education initiative had as its mission to create academic programs that meet students’ learning and service needs “at the same high standard we do for on-campus students” (NMU). This was a kind of organic final step in the journey of digital transformation that began sixteen years before. Nonetheless, how does NMU make a pivot from 117 years of traditional face-to-face learning model to create value and compete in the digital education space? Worse still, when the Covid-19 global pandemic hits in March 2020 and the campus is forced to shut down (mandating all face-to-face teaching and learning, and to transition to online delivery within just two business days and a weekend); how does the university handle this new set of challenges as its online model gets tested in real-time? The story of NMU’s evolution to online education is told by intrinsic and extrinsic factors including declining enrollments due to changing local economics and regional demographics, an old business model now compounded by a global pandemic. This mix of factors would seem to present NMU with both an opportunity to refine its online model and some new challenges to overcome. This evolution also speaks to the importance of having an overarching digital strategy that can drive true digital transformation. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2021.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is an extremely popular practice when the business models of organizations are changing in all industries around the world. In the Russian Federation achieving digital maturity of key sectors of the economy and social sphere is a national development goal until the 2030 year. The development of a system for assessing the state and monitoring of digital maturity is relevant in theoretical and methodological terms. Within the framework of this study, attention is paid to the organization of the higher (university) education system. It was noted that the existing approaches and methods for assessing digital development and digital maturity, as a rule, take into account the infrastructural factors of digitalization (material-Technical factors, informational resources, human resources) and the results of the digitalization of educational products. In the model proposed by the authors, it is suggested to assess the digitalization of business processes and the digitalization of the work environment of students, teachers, and administrative personnel with the allocation of models: A model of a digital university, digital teaching methods, and the formation of the student experience, research and development area, campus and student life, administrative functions, functions of the teaching staff, university management and funding model, personnel, information and communication technologies. In the context of these models, authors highlighted the parameters that characterize the conditions and results of digital transformation with a specification to the result in terms of digital parameters and socio-economic effect. The proposed model can serve as a basis for building a digital maturity profile of a university, become a tool for diagnosing the current state of digitalization, determining the strengths and priorities of digital development.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Through education, we not only make available knowledge and proven procedures from a selected area of human activity, but we also initiate and define our direction towards the future. The basis of education should be active learning targeted at the development of skills and competences using appropriately selected educational content. Technologies are improving education for a quality life in an ever-changing society. In 2020, the European Commission prepared the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-27: Resetting education and training for the digital age. It is based in particular on the European Framework for Personal, Social and Learning to Learn Competence (LifeComp), the European Skills Agenda, the Digital Competences Framework for Citizens (DigComp) and the European Framework of Digital Competences of Educators (DigCompEdu). In this paper, we briefly present the key European documents of digital education and present the Program of Digital Transformation of Education in Slovakia. The main actor in the transformation of education is the teacher and its success is tied to the improvement of the educational process, which takes place in the interaction of teachers and students. The main drivers of change must be universities preparing future teachers. Digital literacy should be part of the graduate's profile in the context of the needs of the labor market and the development of society. Part of the transformation should be a quality digital infrastructure, its systematic development, stimulated by comprehensive and permanent state support. Based on the results of self-assessment of more than 300 schools using the SELFIE tool, we map the current state and vision of Slovak schools in digital education to the near future. The main part of the paper is a look at the goals, tasks and benefits of physics education in digital education. On concrete examples of good practice supported by innovative methodologies created in the national project IT Academy for the subject of physics, we demonstrate the real manageability and grasp of the challenge, such as the digital transformation of education. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {This paper proposes a development model of the adaptation capacity of students to digital transformation in university teaching through three constructs: motivations, digital pedagogy, and student autonomy. For this study, an ad hoc scale was created to record the adaptation capacity of students to digital transformation. The sample was 483 students from the University of Seville (Spain), to whom an online survey was administered during the development of online teaching in the period of November 2020 using the Google Forms platform. The findings of this study showed that university student motivation acquired a greater threshold than autonomy, whose threshold in turn, was greater than that of digital pedagogy in the ability to adapt to online teaching and that the capacity of adaptation to the online modality is explained by the perception that university students have of the usefulness, products, and learning outcomes, among others. In conclusion, the lack of adequate and enabled study spaces is key to developing the online model. We consider all these aspects as prospective research objectives. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {During the transition to the mixed education model during the Covid-19 pandemic, some issues have emerged in the matter of providing and supporting the quality of university education in all countries, including educational programs' relevance to the demands of the labor market, expectations of students and their families, digital transformation of the educational process, and economic stability of institution networks. The purpose of the research was to evaluate the quality of educational services in the higher education systems of Indonesia and Russia. The study systematized several essential factors for achieving educational service quality in the current higher education systems, given the limitations imposed by Covid-19. Following this objective, the study utilized a quantitative approach, adopting the SERVQUAL model that measures the service quality across five service dimensions: Tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. The model aided the development of the questionnaire to assess the quality of the educational services of Indonesian and Russian universities. The questionnaire included 25 close-ended questions on two scales: One to measure the students' expectations regarding the quality of educational services and the other to measure the students' current perceptions. A snowball technique was used to recruit students from Indonesian and Russian universities as participants in the study. The students were asked to assess the educational services of their universities based on their initial expectations and current perceptions. Overall, the students of both countries revealed that they had high expectations from the educational services of their universities. However, the current perceptions of the Russian students regarding the quality of educational services provided by their universities are higher and more positive than the perceptions of the Indonesian students regarding the quality of educational services being delivered to them. The findings of the study have implications for education practitioners. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The article is devoted to the competency model analysis of a technical university graduate and its compliance for the technoscience society. Due to the transition to the society of technoscience, we may notice the shift toward requirements for the future technical specialist in conditions of the society's ongoing digital transformation. Central technoscience drivers are information and communication technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data. The paper focuses on the fact that modern engineer is in demand for the development, design, and manufacture of industrial products and sophisticated social engineering systems. Along with technical and technological optimality, organizational and managerial rationality, and economic efficiency, their development must necessarily include an extensive socio-humanitarian component the human dimension itself. In the digital space, a modern specialist should be able to model and calculate the impact of new technology on a person, their living conditions, environment, social risks and possible consequences of the complex high-tech systems operation. According to the authors' research and a wide range of evidence, the paper shows that the modern labor market is already demonstrating these trends through changes in the role behavior of an engineer in the new economy requirements. An engineer's competence model must necessarily include a whole set of social knowledge and skills to contribute to its effective integration into modern high-tech digital technologies. An engineer of the new digital reality must recognize social foundations and social conditionality development of complex technical systems and technologies. He should also be able to identify the problem area in the interaction of nature, technology, and humanity, apply standard analysis procedures to the problems of this interaction, find ways to overcome these problems, and possess methods of analysis and risk forecasting. © 2022 IEEE.},

This transformation is linked to emerging technologies, the digitalization of processes and resources, and the demand for users to upgrade to the latest technological updates. This research aims to analyze digital transformation and media literacy publications that impact higher education. Its purpose is to identify the types of research and topics they address and explore the scope of digital transformation in higher education institutions. The systematic mapping method was used to analyze 298 articles published in two databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select the articles that could be included in this research. The results show that the largest proportion of articles were found in Scopus, and used both qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods, followed by theoretical-conceptual methods and, to a lesser extent, mixed methods. Likewise, the publications originated in five continents, and the Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy had the largest number of publications, with 14. Forty-two percent of the studies were classified in the strategy category, with the most mentioned topic being digital pedagogies. This research provides a perspective on digital transformation studies in higher education institutions and their internalization approaches. This research may be of value to trainers, students, decision-makers, and researchers interested in transformation, educommunication, and educational innovation. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge enhance job productivity by properly capturing knowledge. At the same time, a knowledge map systematically presents the captured knowledge, which increases the ease of use and utilization of information. With the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak, ICT allows individuals to connect to the outside world for reducing the effect of the pandemic. The role of ICT is more obvious in the education field. Recently, ICT competence and how to improve it, have been one of the hottest topics in research discussions. Even previous studies have shown that ICT competence is crucial in the education field, though most focuses were on teachers, yet the academic staff has been rarely getting attention. This study proposes a method of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to confirm the influencing effects model on ICT competence, which is derived from the knowledge map. The knowledge capturing was carried out through the literature review process for the best depiction on the knowledge map. This research aims to find out the influence effects coupled with the degree of the relationship between different factors. Chiang Mai University was the selected case of a sample group, which represents robust academia in ICT readiness toward the rapid period of digital transformation. The factor model has schemed from the knowledge map and hypothesis setting. The questionnaire was conducted to survey sample views as primary data, consequently, the model was tested by PLS-SEM. The results reveal significant validation on the hypothetical model. These research findings yield worthwhile implications for universities to quickly adapt the layout of strategies, support policy, and appropriate training courses regards to the ICT competence's constitution factors.  © 2022 IEEE.},

First of all, we are talking about a change in the labor function of employees, the use of artificial intelligence during interviews, as well as electronic methods of registration of the emergence, change or termination of labor relations, electronic office work. Due to the specifics of the education sector, the practice of introducing the achievements of the digital economy into the process of legal regulation of the labor of scientific and pedagogical workers of modern universities is of particular interest, especially in terms of the existence of factors that impede the digital transformation of the employment sector. The purpose of the study was to determine the legal possibility of introducing the achievements of the digital economy into the practice of legal regulation of labor, as well as to identify the factors that impede the digital transformation of the employment sector, using the example of scientific and pedagogical workers of modern universities. Materials and methods. The work used the methodology of a comprehensive study, including methods of document analysis, comparative analysis, secondary use of sociological, economic and medical data. The study used Rosstat data on higher education institutions registered in the Russian Federation for 2020. The results of the study show that the development of labor relations is taking place in line with modern global trends in terms of introducing the achievements of the digital economy into the practice of legal regulation of public relations. The sphere of education in our state is not an advanced industry for the introduction of digital technologies. However, according to research data, educational institutions of higher education are actively introducing electronic services and resources into their activities: electronic library systems (97.8%), electronic versions of textbooks (95.8%), training computer programs on certain subjects or topics (92.3%), as well as special software for solving individual problems - 90.8%, electronic document management systems - 84.1%. The specifics of work in educational organizations determines the need for the development and implementation of specific digital transformation tools in modern universities. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

	abstract = {We analyze and evaluate the professional activities and knowledges related to the digital transformation as they are described in the official announcements of selection processes for information professionals in the public sector between 2015 and 2019. Objective: to determine if the system used by the Brazilian public administration in the job selection processes for information professionals takes into consideration, to a sufficient extent, the activities to be developed and the contents to be put to practice in a digital scenario. Methodology: the selection processes for public jobs were chosen from the database of PCI Concursos, as well as with the help of RBO – Assessoria Pública and several CRBs (Regional Librarianship Professional Associations). When deemed necessary, we got in touch with the offices who commissioned the selection processes. The data about the identification of the process, the professional activities to be developed, and the required knowledges were taken from the official announcements and fed into dynamic Excel spreadsheets. The organization of the activities was based on the macroterms of Euro-Referential I-D. The required knowledges were categorized based on a synthesis of proposed information management indicators in a digital environment. Results: The results are displayed schematically, divided according to the different public sectors (universities, federal institutes, town halls, foundations, among others) and to the different jobs (archivist, archives assistant, archives technician, library assistant, cataloging assistant, librarian-documentalist, librarian, museologist). Conclusions/recommendations: The professional activities to be developed, and even more so the contents related to the digital transformation that are valued in the tests are overlooked in the official job announcements. In response to that, we recommend an in-depth review of these documents, with more attention to detail in the description of activities and knowledges, and a joint commitment to clarity on the part of the institutions that commission the job selection processes, the centers that run these processes and the CRBs themselves. We also recommend the convergence between the common mandatory contents offered in university undergraduate courses and the professional demands of the public sector. © 2020 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.

	abstract = {The year 2020 has made it very clear for universities that they need to transform and leverage information and communications technologies (ICTs) more than ever. Disruptive technologies have gained relevance in every aspect of life, altering the traditional ways for work, family and school environments. Thus, Society 5.0, understood somewhat as the humanised focus of Industry 4.0 developments, provides educational institutions with great new opportunities for innovation, as well as pertinence and quality assurance for their teaching and learning processes. This paper describes a comparative analysis on the use of ICTs for education and administrative processes by higher education institutions in five Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru. Their levels of readiness to profit from ICTs are diagnosed, as a function of several factors, including technology infrastructure planning and development, digital skills, educational technology planning, and administrative support, among others. The results allow for undertaking a gap analysis, and a roadmap to overcome the challenges for a successful digital transformation process is then laid out, as well as general recommendations for its use. Insights obtained from this study show clearly that many realities exist, not only between countries, but also within. The lack of infrastructure and financial resources represents major deterrents for ICT appropriation, but it is ICT, in fact, the potential solution for reducing digital exclusion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: The introduction of health information technology (HIT) has drastically changed health care organizations and the way health care professionals work. Some health care professionals have trouble coping efficiently with the demands of HIT and the personal and professional changes it requires. Lagging in digital knowledge and skills hampers health care professionals from adhering to professional standards regarding the use of HIT and may cause professional performance problems, especially in the older professional population. It is important to gain more insight into the reasons and motivations behind the technology issues experienced by these professionals, as well as to explore what could be done to solve them. Objective: Our primary research objective was to identify factors that influence the adoption of HIT in a sample of nurses who describe themselves as digitally lagging behind the majority of their colleagues in their workplaces. Furthermore, we aimed to formulate recommendations for practice and leadership on how to help and guide these nurses through ongoing digital transformations in their health care work settings. Methods: In a Dutch university medical center, 10 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were performed with registered nurses (RN). Ammenwerth's FITT-framework (fit between the Individual, Task, and Technology) was used to guide the interview topic list and to formulate themes to explore. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview data. The FITT-framework was also used to further interpret and clarify the interview findings. Results: Analyses of the interview data uncovered 5 main categories and 12 subthemes. The main categories were: (1) experience with digital working, (2) perception and meaning, (3) barriers, (4) facilitators, and (5) future perspectives. All participants used electronic devices and digital systems, including the electronic health record. The latter was experienced by some as user-unfriendly, time-consuming, and not supportive in daily professional practice. Most of the interviewees described digital working as "no fun at all," "working in a fake world," "stressful," and "annoying." There was a lack of general digital knowledge and little or no formal basic digital training or education. A negative attitude toward computer use and a lack of digital skills contributed to feelings of increased incompetency and postponement or avoidance of the use of HIT, both privately and professionally. Learning conditions of digital training and education did not meet personal learning needs and learning styles. A positive impact was seen in the work environment when colleagues and nurse managers were aware and sensitive to the difficulties participants experienced in developing digital skills, and when there was continuous training on the job and peer support from digitally savvy colleagues. The availability of a digital play environment combined with learning on the job and support of knowledgeable peers was experienced as helpful and motivating by participants. Conclusions: Nurses who are digitally lagging often have had insufficient and ineffective digital education. This leads to stress, frustration, feelings of incompetency, and postponement or avoidance of HIT use. A digital training approach tailored to the learning needs and styles of these nurses is needed, as well as an on-the-job training structure and adequate peer support. Hospital management and nurse leadership should be informed about the importance of the fit between technology, task, and the individual for adequate adoption of HIT. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

	abstract = {Digital Transformation (DT) has become the core motivator for almost all organizations worldwide. In order to cope up with the new demands, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are also giving due consideration to digitizing their services, including pedagogical services. Many challenges are being faced during the successful adoption of DT strategies and plans. One of the main obstacles is the set of challenges related to the stakeholders in HEIs; more precisely, instructors and students. This paper extracts, synthesizes, categorizes, and prioritizes the challenges hindering the success of DT in Saudi universities. Firstly, the paper extracts the main challenges faced by instructors and students, and then constructs a model of the challenges based on the tripartite classification of attitude. The paper adopts a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Method, called the Analytic Network Process (ANP), for the purpose of gathering instructors’ and students’ evaluations and prioritizing their challenges accordingly. A total of 25 instructors and students were recruited from various HEIs in Saudi Arabia to evaluate the model. The results show that learning performance, lack of access to resources, and fear of change are the most significant factors hindering students towards successful adoption of DT. On the other hand, fear of change followed by lack of experience and privacy concerns are the most significant factors hindering instructors towards successful adoption of DT. The research is intended to enlighten decision-makers in Saudi HEIs to consider non-technical challenges while planning for digitizing HEIs services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This article considers the problem of assessing the digital maturity of a higher education institution in order to determine its potential and current areas of digital transformation. The digital maturity of an organization, in this context, can reasonably be thought of as the state it has reached, described by a multidimensional vector of parameters, which allows the organization to be considered compositional mature for a given set of digital attributes. In a first approximation, a indicators system of digital maturity of a higher education institution has been formed. Two existing models have been analyzed and a proprietary model for assessing the digital maturity of a higher education institution has been developed. The totality of the indicators of the three models is considered from a systematic perspective and taking into account expert assessments of the informative value of the indicators in relation to assessing the level of digital maturity. The results of the group examination made it possible to carry out the primary selection of indicators of digital maturity that have signs of sufficiency. The main message of the study of the set of indicators is that it is possible to judge competently about the digital maturity of any organization only based on attracting sufficient indicators that characterize the effectiveness of the organization due to certain digital transformation activities. At the same time, all activities should be analysed to compare the costs of resources and the results of these activities. The results are an increase in the intellectual resource of the user of the fruits of digital transformation. Ultimately, these are the additional cognitive capacity and spiritual qualities of the well-mannered and polite persons. The latter can be characterized by a dominant influence on the structure of the uncertainty of the organization's activities. The resulting evaluation model requires further research in the context of its application in solving the problem of effective digital transformation of organizational systems. © 2021 IEEE},

Additionally, for comparison, data from 2015 for a similar sample (1st year bachelor’s degree students) were used. Results. Positive attitudes towards online and blended learning are gradually increasing. The factor analysis of data from 2021 showed that applicants who support the online and blended learning include: those aspiring for master’s degree upon completing their bachelor’s degree course; those who choose their degree field rationally – men who apply for a state-funded education in any Russian university (including participants of federal contests – ‘Academic Olympics’). The above groups are formed mainly under the influence of external factors. Another group includes those oriented towards self-realization – women who choose their degree field relying on their personal inclinations for a future profession (the influence of internal factors). Discussion and Conclusion. The research results contribute to the development of scientific ideas about the blended learning model and emphasize the value of institutional research based on feedback from university students for making informed management decisions on change. The materials of the paper will be useful when designing the educational process in the Russian universities’ transition to the blended learning model. © 2021 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

	abstract = {COVID‐19 has accelerated digital transformation in teaching‐learning environments. Universities based on face‐to‐face models have had to quickly adapt their processes to ensure the success of remote teaching‐learning systems in the last months. The growing demand for technological resources has meant an effort to understand the requirements and variables that affect students’ acceptance, intention to use, and adoption of these tools. This study aims to analyze students’ acceptance of online processes adopted by universities because of the COVID‐19 scenario. Although this study is based on a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), it also considers other factors, such as perceived efficiency and satisfaction. A questionnaire was built and distributed to 313 students. The data were processed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) method. The results indicate that 30.7% of the students improved their views of remote education using online systems. How-ever, 49.9% of students do not believe that face‐to‐face teaching‐learning education will be replaced by virtual teaching‐learning education in the long term. Our findings confirm that the enriched TAM model built provides a useful theoretical approach to understanding and explaining users’ acceptance of remote learning environments when there is a need to rapidly migrate from face‐to-face to online teaching‐learning processes. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Digital technology is transforming society and business like never before. Digital technology has made inroads into all sections of society, especially with the pandemic restricting interaction and movement in the physical space. Education systems and institutions have witnessed a drastic change in their pedagogy. Education institutions adopting digital technologies can become drivers of growth and development for their ecosystems bringing significant changes in education, engagement, and management of class activities of educational institutions. The education system will have to adapt and evolve to take advantage of the new technologies and tools and develop strategies to play an active role in the digital transformation process. In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, higher education institutions have adopted digital platforms for teaching and learning. The study attempts to understand the instructors/academician/teachers training process adopted by selected higher education institutions in India to facilitate migration to digital platforms. Further, the study analyses the challenges faced in the new normal of education and the levels of training process initiated by institutions for teaching faculty. The authors have tried to analyse how this has enabled instructors to meet the challenges of conducting online classes and increase class effectiveness. The study unfolded the impact of high-level institutional training on class effectiveness and how individual digital preparedness is essential in engaging virtual classrooms. Further, the positive impact of training in reducing anxiety in engaging online sessions and the extent of motivation to continue online teaching as it has become inevitable with the second wave of the pandemic were examined across age and gender. An attempt is made to suggest few strategies for continued effective online class engagement as India battles through the second wave of the pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Factors, the latter that are radically redefining business models and creative, communicative and representation methods. Digital transformation guides the new processes of visualisation, promotion and narration of the fashion system. The emergence of information and communication technologies represents the push to rethink new communication strategies and innovative ways of educational activities. In this scenario, the Schools and Universities' role became crucial to define new strategies, methodologies, and tools to stimulate the development of new landscapes of material, technological, and cultural skills linked to Creative Cultural Industries. In this context, the educational system can increasingly be understood as a field of experimentation for multi-channel information transfer modes. The article intends to investigate the potentialities offered by new digital channels (and in particular Instagram) to implement new transmedia educational processes. In this context, the classroom becomes an "increased space", enabling new ways of learning and relationship between the different knowledge needed and social media became one of the interfaces to create and augmented learning experience.

	abstract = {Background: In a time of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pan-demic, digital social support can prove helpful in buffering the stress and anxiety especially for students whose lives were being affected both socially and academically. The present study aims to explore the emotional and informational social support available to students during the online transformation of their education. It further investigates factors affecting anxiety and stress among stu-dents. Design and methods: An online survey was administered among 479 undergraduate students at a private university in Saudi Arabia from 2nd March till 17th June 2020. Descriptive analysis was used to report the findings of students’ self-reported data. Results: The results revealed that more than 70% of the students reported that they were satisfied with the informational and emotional support available to them via digital platforms. However, they felt less connected with the teachers and academic administration. Feeling sick (46%), being locked down at homes and isolation (43%) were major causes of stress and anxiety. 71% of the students reported their ability to keep themselves busy, however, only 55% of students mentioned that they did not feel lonely while confined to their homes. In these circumstances, the continuation of studies via online platforms helped students reduce stress and anxiety (52%). Conclusions: Although this online transformation was not planned, the university was able to provide adequate informational support to the students. However, students were dependent upon friends, family and relatives for emotional support. The results of the study point towards the need of training for teachers and academic administrative staff in order to better address students’ needs for social support during the crisis. The results also con-tribute to the body of data reporting the various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students in a way to reach a sustainable framework for supporting students. © the Author(s), 2021 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.},

	abstract = {The information society is characterized by the information data conversion and the information in knowledge to support the decision making and the human development. In this sense, the digital transformation implies not only the use of technology to store data, but also a change of processes and organizational culture, allowing the entry of knowledge management into the new economy of the intangibles. This transformation has changed the game rules of socio-technical systems of organizations and their interrelationships, impacting different components of organizations. Advance in adapting the transformation in organizations has not been symmetrical in all sectors and regions of the world. Previous research shows that in education in Latin America the degree of incorporation has been less than in other economic sectors and zones of the world. That is why, the objective of study is the identification and analysis of the progress achieved by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) of the region, concerning digital transformation of their academic and management processes, besides recognizing their opportunities and challenges in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The methodology includes a qualitative approach. To collect the information, the document analysis technique is used, and the main factor is the searching through reference database and complete text. Data analysis is made in accordance with the pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, central and management, digital transformation enablers of missionary, and support processes of the HEIs. The results show that, while it is true that the HEIs in Latin America lag behind their peers in other countries, it is found that, from 2018, the progress on the digital transformation of processes of the HEIs in Latin America has been very significant. The main impact is given in the incorporation of pillars of industry 4.0 in: graduation, using blockchain; teaching, collaborative virtual reality; artificial intelligence to assist students; university management, through virtual assistants; and research supported by robotic. Improvement of cyber-physical and big data systems is not evident. It is concluded that digital transformation of the HEIs in Latin America is in the phase of early adoption, with some successful cases of the main reference HEIs, top-ranked in the academic ranking of the region, which will probably be imitated by other HEIs. The main challenges for the digital transformation of the HEIs in Latin America are related to culture, resistance to change, the hierarchical government, and the understanding that information is the key asset of the knowledge society. A new opportunity emerges for the digital transformation of HEIs in Latin America and for the researchers of the topic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction. The challenge of the pandemic forced educational organisations in Russia to resort to massive transition to distance learning and accelerated digital transformation of schools. It has become more obvious than ever that the digital transformation of a school is not limited to a simple technical update of its information resources but implies a fundamental rethinking of the school activities based on the capabilities of digital technologies. The aim of the study was to investigate the experience of digital transformation and the Russian school principals' notions about it as a systemic process. The subject of the study is the notion about the systemic impact of digital transformation processes on schools; the experience of complexity in the introduction of information technologies in the educational process and school management, the assessment of the progress of digitalisation; the notions about the factors of successful digital transformation, which require a critical understanding of the experience of implementing information technologies in the school, highlighting key success factors. Methodology and research methods. The authors analysed 7189 questionnaires using computer methods for processing the natural language. The questionnaires were completed in general education organisations of 66 regions from all federal districts of Russia. The respondents' answers were categorised in accordance with the European Framework for Technologically Competent Educational Organisations (DigCompOrg). Results. The research findings demonstrated the significant imbalance in the frequency of responses: the most frequent answers belong to the “Infrastructure” category, while the least frequent ones belong to the categories of pedagogical aspects of digital transformation affecting changes in the educational content and methods for assessing educational outcomes. It is concluded that the respondents' replies reflect the institutional position of school principals in the current educational system: a head of a government-funded school positions herself/himself as an administrative executor and a representative of the founder, rather than a leader of the teaching team. Consequently, the provision of educational achievements and students' personal development are largely not perceived by principles of Russian schools as a priority management task. Scientific novelty of the present research lies in the attempt to answer the question of how systematically the digital transformation of the principle is perceived, to apply DigCompOrg to the assessment of these categories by the European Framework of technologically competent educational organisations, as well as to use natural language processing methods to process text answers to open-ended questions of the questionnaire, which made it possible to obtain results on a large sample with wide geographical coverage. Practical significance. The research findings can be used in the development and implementation of advanced training programmes for school and college administrations in accordance with the ongoing digitalisation of Russian educational system. © 2021 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

	abstract = {Although entrepreneurial intention has been widely studied using cognitive models, we still lack entrepreneurial vocation and, therefore, lack disruptive innovations. Entrepreneurship scholars have some understanding of the reasons underlying this weakness, although there is much room for improvement in our learning concerning how to promote entrepreneurship among university students, especially in the transformed context of digital technologies. This paper focuses on the early stages of start-up, and in particular seeks to evaluate what role social and psychological factors play in the development of entrepreneurial intentions. Drawing on network theory, we consider the impact of social networks on entrepreneurial intention. Specifically, we analyze the influence of two types of social networks: face-to-face and online social networks, with the latter proving especially important in digital transformations. In addition, based on affective congruency theory, we relate affect with entrepreneurial intention. Particularly, we evaluate the influence of positive and negative dispositional affectivity on the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. Finally, since affect and emotions can also be related with social relationships, we analyze whether dispositional affectivities influence entrepreneurial intention through the mediation effect of social networks. Using structural equation modeling, we confirm the impact of both online and face-to-face social networks, as well as positive dispositional affectivity on entrepreneurial intention for 589 higher education students in Spain. However, negative dispositional affectivity is not seen to influence entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, both face-to-face and online social networks are influenced by positive dispositional affectivity. Moreover, these two types of networks can even partially mediate the relationship between positive dispositional affectivity and entrepreneurial intention. Positive dispositional affectivity can thus influence entrepreneurial intention in two different ways: directly and indirectly through both face-to-face and online social networks. This study provides further insights and adds to the literature on affect, social networks, and entrepreneurial intention. From a broader perspective, we also contribute to the literature on disruptive innovations by explaining how the development of entrepreneurial intentions would have positive consequences for university students vis-à-vis achieving these disruptive innovations. © Copyright © 2020 Pérez-Fernández, Martín-Cruz, Delgado-García and Rodríguez-Escudero.},

With digitalization and a transition towards a decarbonized economy, a mining industry necessitating new skillsets and with technology cycles that are getting shorter and shorter, the new panorama is transmitting pressure in the need of trained workforce, and mining companies need to ensure that their boards and staffs are properly constituted to support the transformations that the sector is currently undergoing, including fluency in such areas as technology, integration, systems security, and cybersecurity. In the raw materials sector, technology is not an end in itself. The greatest impact will come from embedding these technologies as an integrated whole and all across the mining value chain. The “New Industrial Strategy for Europe” (European Commission, 2020) addresses the twin challenge of the green and the digital transformation as both will require new technologies, with investment and innovation to match. Mining industry will create new products, services, markets, and business models, new types of jobs that do not yet exist, but which will need skills that students do not yet have. The breadth and depth, the scale and speed, the nature and necessity of the twin transitions are unprecedented. For this, the European industry cannot afford to simply adapt: it must now become the accelerator and enabler of change and innovation. This paper describes the activities developed as part of the MEITIM Project with the support of EIT Raw Materials, one of the eight Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) initiated by the EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology), funded by the European Commission, and whose mission is to help boost the competitiveness, growth, and attractiveness of the European raw materials sector through radical innovation and guided entrepreneurship. In this paper, the MEITIM conception and innovations are described, to show how three leading European Universities, with the help of EIT Raw Materials are shaping the way to help students to acquire and develop skills and knowledge addressed to this competitive environment, and become part of the highly-skilled workforce that the mining industry will require. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

	abstract = {The transition to digital education is an inevitable trend in modern ed-ucation. The digital transformation of education is primarily aimed at achieving the required educational results, increasing the availability and quality of educa-tion at all its levels. The features of digital education are management of educa-tional results; designing individual educational trajectories; an abundance of ed-ucational materials; correct use of new technologies: "mobile learning, virtual and augmented reality; learning in cooperation, involvement in learning based on gamification and storytelling (educational games), etc.". The teacher needs to un-derstand the possibilities of ICT both for expanding and improving the educa-tional process and for using digital technologies to enhance and introduce inno-vations in the field of education. In the context of distance learning, in which the whole world found itself as a result of the announced pandemic, it was the teach-er's mastering of the components of ICT competence to solve emerging issues in the professional activity that became a necessary condition for his professional growth, ensuring a high-quality learning process and promoting the skills of the 21st century. Requirements for the teacher's ICT competence include the pres-ence of an information culture; IT readiness; digital literacy. The article presents the results of a study on mastering the ICT competence of the teaching staff of the Belgorod State National Research University in dynamics, which are based on the requirements for the ICT competence of the teacher and include 3 levels of digital literacy: the basic level, the level of proficiency in working in a digital educational environment and level of proficiency in digital educational technol-ogies. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

	abstract = {Endorsed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution and pushed abruptly by the irruption of the Corona crisis, a large number of technological resources, digital platforms, and virtual and augmented reality applications were massively incorporated in all educational areas, including the field of higher education. This phenomenon has been not only ideal but essential in STEM programs (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), with the aim of developing the aspect of digital transformation, although technological enablers have ended up being used also as Teaching Tools. But what about the Learning Tools? The present work shows that it is possible that, without the adequate design of a framework for the Teaching and Learning Process, these innovative technological resources are not capable of guaranteeing per se the effective intellectual engagement of students in their own learning. The cognitive and metacognitive tools used in this work were designed for the development of four skills declared as fundamental in the Education 4.0 Framework: Innovation and creativity, global citizenship, digital transformation and interpersonal skills. This paper offers findings, results and discussions of a study conducted over 3 years, with more than 200 engineering students, by implementing an approach designed especially for Generation Z students. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this research was to address the critical need for supply chain workforce training to empower employees to use new digital technologies and to identify and evaluate current sources of supply chain training. Design/methodology/approach: An online search was performed to locate training that is available for supply chain employees. Training providers who met the online delivery criterion were identified and evaluated on: (1) amount of supply chain content and/or digital technology content, (2) flexibility, (3) customizable and (4) credentials offered. Findings: Several sources of supply chain training were identified—supply chain professional organizations, consultants, MOOC courses and MicroMasters programs at colleges and universities. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study are limited by the fact that the number of supply chain training providers identified is not exhaustive and because the study examined training opportunities available at a particular point in time. Course offerings will change over time; certification requirements will be updated, and new providers will appear. Practical implications: By identifying sources of supply chain training that are currently available to help bridge this serious skill shortage, the results can serve as a guide to enterprises moving toward supply chain digitalization. Social implications: To succeed in the current environment of digital transformation, employees need opportunities to build digital skills that are demanded by corporations around the world. This is especially important at a time when unemployment is at an alarming rate.

	abstract = {Digital transformation is currently one of the most relevant issues in the field of innovation studies. Modern capitalism based on innovation has a characteristic element, uncertainty. This refers to the fact that not enough is known about the state of complexity and dynamics of technological changes and current new technologies. These changes occur exponentially, consequently generating very short economic and technological cycles. The challenge for society as a whole, and particularly for innovation actors, is to be able to adapt to these dynamics quickly. The research question that supports this work is how to reduce the degree of complexity of innovation management in the context of digital transformation. The objective pursued is fundamentally to characterize in theory and practice the dynamics that digital transformation experiences as a dominant technological pattern and its effects on innovation management. A set of theoretical and practical findings is presented that are related to the characterization of the current dynamics of digital transformation and its adaptation in innovation management. Digital transformation is focused as the dominant technological pattern and its complexity is characterized. With the findings obtained in this work, innovation actors, particularly in less advanced economies, may have a greater understanding of the behavior of digital transformation that allows them to develop new strategies and build a Mindset for rapid adaptation to the dominant technological pattern. As a methodological instrument, the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has been used to address in practice the dynamics and complexity of digital transformation based on a robust theoretical foundation. This method has been used to analyze the positioning of 4 Mexican universities in the face of digital transformation. Copyright © 2021 by Naudé Scribante.

However, existing models of educational technology adoption and integration predominantly focus on school settings as well as on individual factors explaining the assimilation processes. Therefore, this research intents to fill the gap of a holistic model of technology adoption in educational organizations through developing a theoretically grounded maturity model. In a case study, the maturity model of technology adoption was implemented in an European educational organization. The study included N = 222 employees in two waves of data collection. Findings indicate a positive attitude towards IT and digital media within the respective organization. Overall, the educational organization was classified as digitally pragmatist. It is suggested that maturity model development should be highly transparent, following a clear methodology. Model evaluation and validation should be carried out before transfer and generalization can take place. Factors mediating digital maturity and organizational performance on individual (i.e., motives, attitudes) and on organizational level (i.e., organizational culture) should be taken into consideration. For successful technology adoption processes, organizational and human resource development ought to go hand in hand, supported by a sound communication strategy. © 2019, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is enabling institutions to enhance their processes by using data and technology. In education, digital transformation allows improving the learning experience as well as the institution processes. Within education 4.0, artificial intelligence applied to learning analytics is playing a key role for universities, particularly in the dropout issue, especially in STEM with the highest dropout rates. This is particularly relevant in the Latin American Higher Education scope, given the low labour productivity in these countries. In these countries, universities often have more demand than supply, and achieving an adequate balance between admission rates and dropout rates is a key issue. A high dropout rate harms the prestige of the university and damages students who were admitted without being adequate candidates. Understanding why students abandon their studies help to know what a university can do to avoid it. Data mining (DM) techniques can help discover the individual features that influence the dropout. There are different studies proposing models to predict dropout, and most are based on data that are not at the admission stage. We propose an approach that uses DM techniques to predict dropout based on data at the admission stage. We discover factors influencing dropout by a decision tree and association rules. We use a dataset of students of a computer science degree from a University in South America and achieve good performance when predicting dropout. The most attributes influencing dropout are the pre-grade performance in STEM subjects and the location of the city of residence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {MOOCs ability to provide valuable skills and competencies at a fraction of the cost of other educational offers, in a fraction of the time, and from the comfort of one’s own home, has proven to be a promising business reference to digital transformation, as applied in higher education. This paper overviews the impact of blockchain features, such as the trendy selfsovereign identity adding precious disruptive value along MOOCs value chains, especially around content acquisition, digital marketing and monetization, as well as facilitating acquisition and transfer of credentials in a digital trust-focused environment. A sound, trackable and protective digital identity has been long considered a needed asset, whereas the owner of the credentials, either the university, individual or employer has full control over the data that is shared across the educational ecosystem, on a case-by-case basis. The article also aspires at critically observing whether using blockchain tech for courseware aggregation and delivery constitutes a sound business case, as well as a worthy exploration for intrinsic learning motivation and an enhancement to higher education value chain. Secondly, blockchain and the self-sovereign identity offer benefits for the education authoring providers in particular and token-based monetization models for OER education. Blockchain has the potential to disrupt significantly current business models, by facilitating legally binding smart-contracts, helping streamline the credentials' processes, protecting the viability and legitimacy of education records as well as increasing the effectiveness of educational agregators. Reliably easy and quick to transfer credentials are essential for the labor force to be able to swiftly introduce newly acquired skills and competencies to the real business. In the same time, education providers are incentivized by an education governance model that enables better management and sustainability. © 2020, National Defence University-Carol I Printing House.

	abstract = {Organizations nowadays focus on, not implementing ERP systems, but also leveraging ERP systems as part of their digital strategy. They holistically address people, processes, and technology for a digital transformation. Meanwhile, higher education institutions (HEIs) are also facing an imperative need for the implementation of modern technologies to stay competitive and differentiate them as an innovation leader. Higher education management is challenged with maintaining high-level information systems. These systems can generate complex real-time reports for effective resource allocation and better decision making. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems can help HEIs manage their resources and operations effectively. A study of ERP among 112 HEIs in Egypt was conducted. This study originally investigates the Egyptian HEIs’ perception of the ERP system as a new integrating tool for its value. The results showed that Egyptian HEIs are still at the embryonic level as the majority have not adopted these systems yet. However, ERP value has been undoubtedly perceived by HEIs’ managers. Therefore, the present study fruitfully reflected HEIs’ understanding of the imperative need of ERP systems as strategic systems for their competitiveness. Consequently, the study suggests that Egyptian HEIs and ERP vendors take steps to remove any barriers and accelerate the ERP adoption process. Also, this research contributes to the advancement of ERP concepts and characteristics from HEIs' standpoint and a grants practical verification to the higher education context. Overall, the study advances existing knowledge and research on ERP, strategic management systems, and HEIs. © University of Tehran, Faculty of Management},

	abstract = {The United Nations (UN) identifies four key elements as agents for change and for addressing societal challenges: education, research, innovation and leadership. The use of technology, from a pedagogical and organizational point of view, in higher education institutions has brought about new challenges. The integration of them in the teaching–learning processes has experienced a great evolution, giving way to a digital transformation and the acquisition of new skills and knowledge, thus pointing towards quality education within the framework of sustainable development objectives. This document aims to describe and analyze the ways in which seven higher education institutions, three in Spain and four in Mexico, have taken up the challenge of adopting technologies and applying them to the educational process. To this end, in-depth interviews and direct observations were carried out. The results point to three dimensions: technological, pedagogical and organizational, which shed light on the different factors that influence the choice and availability of the use of technologies. The results indicate that contextual factors play a determinant role in the ability of an institution to profit from technologies to aid the educational process and guarantee its quality. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {This study examines the readiness of a faculty for the social challenges caused by the digital transformation in academia with the use of covariance-based structural equation modeling (CBSEM). Based on the survey results, we have examined the interplay between factors related to digital transformation. The concepts of information literacy and digital literacy related to academic librarianship were used as the basis for the self-efficacy and empowerment necessary to achieve individual success during digital changes in the academic community. We then checked how such a sense of empowerment among academics explains the presence of information culture in this community and different approaches to information management. The factors of information management and information use were presented as affecting a university's institutional readiness for the new requirements of digital transformation from the perspective of governance issues. The findings highlight that information literacy underlies academics' empowerment and a high level of self-efficacy driven by this literacy can also be indirectly translated into the formation of pro-active information culture that strengthens an academic's position in creating information use outcomes and by making them ready for digital transformation. Through information literacy outcomes the academic libraries can turn out to be an important transformative force in terms of digital changes at universities. © 2021 The Author(s)},

They arise when implementing the strategy of transition from the classical form of the university to the smart one. The objects of digital transformation of the university (data, university processes, user interfaces and people) are defined. It is shown that in a smart university, the management decision-making process should be based on approaches and technologies based on Big Data. This article also presents a conceptual vision of the analytical subsystem of intelligent university management. It shows an algorithm for using digital analytics in making management decisions based on Big Data. The directions and tools for analyzing the digital traces of the key stakeholders of the university (teachers, students, employees and management) are highlighted. The mathematical apparatus for supporting the management of the university digital transformation, taking into consideration the features of the educational environment, is proposed. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the development of models and methods of decision-making in the university's digital transformation management system, taking into account the universality of the management process, as well as the degree of its uncertainty. The proposed models can be applied to manage the digital transformation of the university and the transition to the concept of intellectual education.

	abstract = {The article discusses the project approach to the implementation of individual educational trajectories (IET) in modern Russian university. The relevance of the study stems from the lack of effective models of individualization of the educational process in higher education. The aim of this work is to analyze the project approach as a key subjective factor in the implementation of individual educational paths in the structure of a modern university. The interdisciplinary methodology lies as the basis of the study, which allows integrating the educational practices of higher education in a single context at the fundamental level and achieving a synergistic effect in their implementation. The majority of modern scientific works are devoted either to the problems of individualization of higher education, or to the implementation of project activities at a university, without a detailed analysis of the correlations of these concepts of modern educational discourse. As results, the article presents the key principles of the project approach to the implementation of IET (systemicity, teamwork, interaction with the external environment, digital transformation of the learning process, staffing of project work), as well as a list of issues requiring discussion by the scientific community exploring modern educational practices of higher education in Russia. The authors emphasize that the project approach to the implementation of IEP in higher education can be considered as a special technique based on the competency-based approach to individualization of education and focusing on the active position of the student to recognize educational deficits and make an individual choice of the educational route, to see and comprehend the directions of competency-based growth and self-development. The awareness of individualization of learning is determined by the project approach, while the individual educational path becomes more conscious and logical for the student, provoking his (her) educational needs and providing the need for the development of certain competencies.

To solve this problem, a sustainable digital transformation model was developed, consisting of four dimensions: infrastructure, business architecture, digitalization, and people. In each dimension, indicators were used to assess at what stage of maturity it is found, which by integrating them allowed us to know the level of general maturity of the digital transformation of the institution in which our case study was applied to the effects of knowing the digital divide.

The composition of the single information space (SIS) is given, the role of its constituent elements is revealed. Special attention is paid to the use of Wi-Fi technologies. The methodology is based on the logistic approach to considering the innovative information educational space as a unified object with special features being determined by the elements included in the system. The principle of the unity of information space consists in possibility of logging into any SIS system by a single account. So, changing of information in one system should lead to change in another, and the exchange of information is realized between the automated systems due to the creation of integration mechanisms based on the universal information gateway, enabling the integrated control system be relevant. The principal conclusion is that single information space creation solves the task of transition from patchwork automation of various fields of activity of the organization to a single integrated approach in building an automated control system based on a single industrial software platform. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Digitalization can be described in a variety of ways. One way that best describes it, is that when you employ it, it changes an old business structure model and provides new avenues and value-producing opportunities. We can see this in so many examples in the current digital transformations happening across different industries such as in retail where online shops are transforming retail as we know it. We also see this in transportation where sharing economy is spreading all over the industry and “uberification” is not a brand name anymore, but rather a way in how we geographically commute. We notice this as well in financial services where block chain technologies are changing financial services. Changes are also taking place with the increasing number of payment methods and the use of technology in the financial sector and for financial inclusion. All these advancements are the result of employing digital technologies as well as changing the way we do business. Egypt is facing a lot of challenges which the government is trying to convert into opportunities using digital transformation. We can see evidence of advancement in regards to Egypt's competitiveness in general, such as its position in the Global Competitiveness Index, (GCI) which jumped from being ranked from 116 to 93, in the past three years. The GCI is used as an indicator showing the advancement of countries in different aspects, digitalization and all what entails the innovation ecosystem, which is considered one of the factors that can affect the competitiveness of a country. In this research, the researcher is proposing a new initiative/method called Government Innovation 4.0 for true digital transformation to happen. This initiative involves the whole innovation sector as well as the Egyptian government. This initiative includes universities, youth, startups, entrepreneurs, government employees, SMEs, NGOs, as well as investors. The researcher put the framework with the aim of aligning all the stakeholders to serve the national vision of full digital transformation and to bridge what we call the Innovation Divide which is considered more challenging than digital divide. © 2020 Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020.

	abstract = {In today's world where digital transformation is taking place very strongly with the effect of the pandemic, there has been a transition from face-to-face education to online education. In this respect, examining variables that affect the instructors' intention to use these technologies during the pandemic has a critical role in terms of the quality of education both during and after the pandemic. The purpose of the study is to determine the variables that affect the instructors’ intentions to use ITs by extending TAM and to examine the roles of individual differences (moderators) in the proposed model. Data were collected online from 321 faculty members working at various universities in fall semester 2020. PLS-SEM technique and multi-group analysis were used in data analysis. The proposed model explains 75.3% of the intention. The results showed that self-efficacy, perceived enjoyment, compatibility and facilitating conditions affect the intention to use IT. The most influential construct among these was compatibility. In addition, contrary to expectations, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are expressed as the most critical determinants, and openness and resistance to change, which are important personality traits, did not affect intention. The results provide valuable information about education during the pandemic, which can contribute to improving the quality of education during and after the pandemic. Multi-group analysis revealed that all of the moderators (gender, age, and experience) had an influence on the various relationships. Accordingly, implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {With the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the call for social distancing, academic institutions reacted by shutting campuses and calling for the shift to virtual online delivery. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT), this study was designed in an effort to sustain success in these global challenging times that is informed by strategic foresight. HCT called for an all-online delivery starting March 22, 2020 after a two-day pilot in the preceding week. HCT readiness is a result of orchestrating: an ecosystem perspective on digital transformation, a forward-looking institutional strategy that has technology utilization as a major pillar, an education technology strategy, and a comprehensive set of intelligent learning tools. Forward-looking scenarios were designed based on two critical uncertainties: (1) COVID-19 longevity and (2) socio-economic disruption. These scenarios were named: Divine Mercy, Recovery Mode, New Norm, and Survival of the Fittest. Subsequently, the features of each scenario are assessed for implications on HCT’s business and support operations, and the proactive strategies are documented to cope with these implications. During the full online delivery mode period, HCT surveys result reported 86% satisfaction amongst its faculty and 54% amongst its student body, delivered 234 000 hours through 61000 online classes, and delivered over 21000 hours of online professional development (PD) sourced from HCT’s Learning Management System. Over the same period, more than 1900 non-faculty employees were running business as usual from home reported via online attendance and daily/weekly task forms. Envisioning future scenarios and preparing the organization for them is a practice that should be deployed in parallel to emergency response efforts to ensure successful business continuity. © 2020, Sciedu Press.

	abstract = {Characteristic features of the research and innovation impact on construction enterprises digitization were investigated and generalized in the article. Creation of digital industrial platforms of construction industry in different countries of the world and their adaptation to market realities was analyzed. It was established by authors that in order to transform construction enterprises management system in Ukraine, and the implementation of industry digitalization must be primarily aimed at developing mechanisms for adapting country’s economic system to European space and realizing projects that require collective efforts with involvement of public and private stakeholders on regional and national levels. It was argued that the main factors slowing down dynamics of construction complex development in Poltava region include: significant currency fluctuations, liquidity crisis of banking institutions, and reduction of the population solvent demand. Introduction of new forms of relationships between enterprises, government, public authorities, universities, in particular, by forming a cluster on the basis of innovative hub makes possible ensuring exit of construction complex from economic crisis and perspective development of construction complex in Poltava region. It was confirmed by researches that there should be effective interaction in the “technical education—business of the construction sphere—innovative activity” chain and professional consultations by establishing a clear organization of “technical universities—scientific researches—production—construction” should be provided. Measures to combine potential of research, innovative development directly with industry and practical construction were substantiated and revealed. Authors developed a real model of construction cluster in Poltava region created on the basis of an innovative hub. It was also concluded that the main advantage of proposed clustering approach on the basis of innovative hub is that due to such development of cluster systems, higher school can effectively integrate results of higher, academic and sectoral science of Ukraine, as well as advanced results of the world community science in development and implementation of innovative projects in the field of construction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Those events coincided with the general trend towards total digitalization of all spheres of life, including education. New concepts have emerged and taken hold - digital education and digital university. However, a mechanism for the development of a digital university has not yet been proposed. In the present study, an institutional approach was used to analyze the problems of the development of a digital university. The research scheme was used: institutions - motivation - control. The results of the empirical study (questionnaire and survey of university entries and its partners) made it possible to identify the existing contradictions between the participants in university activities and the external environment in terms of assessing aspects of the digital development of the university, to highlight the most effective institutions, conditions of positive motivation and control mechanisms for successful digital transformation of a university. The authors propose their own version of the concept for the development of a digital university, introducing as the core of it a new scientific concept - infrastructure logic. They lay a foundation for the principles of infrastructure logic, formation mechanisms and approaches to the use of indicators of digital development based on infrastructure logic, directions for improving the strategy of digital development of the university 4.0. The conclusions and recommendations formulated in this study can be used by other educational systems and universities. © 2021 Research Group Education and Virtual Learning (GREAV).

	abstract = {Looking through history, each wave shows its unique causality between innovation, diffusion, institutional changes, productivity changes, changes in the number of companies and employees, and relative price factors (Lundquist, Olander and Svensson Pfenning, 2008). An increasing number of technological innovations requires the current workforce to continually update their skills to be ready to respond to new roles in the sectors in which they operate, and which are influenced or will be influenced by new technologies. The paper will show the initiatives taken by individual governments and companies, starting from education, especially higher education, adapting curricula, participating in the new curricula development, and ultimately creating a new workforce that is ready to respond to the work demands of the digital economy market. Effective skills in using technology, combined with knowledge and innovation competencies, can increase the digital skills compatibility with the needs of the digital economy. Most industries and sectors recognise that, as more and more digitalizations are made, there will be more and more demand for employees with different levels of digital skills. An overview of the definition of digital skills with detailed insight into the areas that they encompass is made, and the differences between the terms related to digital literacy, such as information and communication technology literacy, information, media and Internet literacy are listed. It is of the utmost importance to ‘jump’ into the wave of digital changes on time. How many great major powers have succeeded at this, such as the United States, China, Australia, and what is the situation in Europe and Croatia when it comes to adaptation in the times of digital transformation. These are the primary questions and the purpose of this paper. The answer to these questions is presented in terms of formulations, definitions, statistical data, investment strategies and analysis of many relevant sources.

	abstract = {The purpose of the study is to prove the need for development of innovative territorial clusters (ITC) in steppe regions. With a well-known determination of the factors of sustainable economic development of steppe regions of Russia, territorial planning and formation of environmental management structures were considered the most important. Today, the greatest relevance for steppe regions of Russia should be seen in development of the ITC as the most important condition for transition to a new technological order in the coming decades of the 21th century and a new management system based on improving scenario forecasting tools that allow identifying trends and incentives for sustainable economic development of steppe regions of Russia as a result of minimizing problems and strengthening their economic potential in the process of climate restructuring of the Earth. The results of the study include the following: definition of the ITC role as a tool for normalizing economic relations between research and educational organizations, business, development institutions and the state, as well as possibility of adapting the resulting cluster model of joint activity management to solving problems of sustainable economic development of steppe regions in the context of digital transformation of Russian economy. Innovative territorial approach should become the basis for Complex programs of ecological, economic and noospheric development of Russian regions. And there are all the prerequisites for this-rapid development of digital technologies, and along with it the growth and rapid promotion of digital innovations, without which there is no future, make this goal feasible and achievable. Therefore, it can be said that ITCs in steppe regions should serve as a source of digital innovations in Russian economy, creating new jobs for population, increasing viability of their territories and ensuring food security of the country as a whole.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The rise of digital technologies is a macro trend, forcing organizations to transform digitally. This so-called digital transformation (DT) is affecting the field of higher education, too. Higher education institutions (HEI) digitalize internal processes and offer digitally-enabled education services. Different types of barriers are challenging a successful DT and need to be mastered. Our study follows a longitudinal research design by surveying different student cohorts in the same courses. Before the pandemic, we identified the barriers to DT and transferred them into a research model. Pre-pandemic, we surveyed the influence of barriers perceived by management students on the DT process of their HEI. Taking the pandemic as a solid external driver on DT, we examined students’ intra-pandemic perception in the same courses as the pre-pandemic analysis. With pre-pandemic data, the projection explains over 50% of the adjustment problems of the DT process. Based on intra-pandemic data, the explanation decreases to 45%. Hypothetically, we expected a better explanation degree as an impact of the pandemic. Interestingly, results indicate that intra-pandemic perceptions got more complex and, therefore, less significant. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can play a critical role in improving health care for individuals and communities. By providing new and more efficient ways of accessing, communicating, and storing information, ICTs can help bridge the information divide that has emerged in the health sector in developing countries—between health professionals and the communities they serve and between the researchers in the health sector and the practitioners who need the research finding (Digital Transformation in Healthcare in 2020: 7 Key Trend. Retrieved from https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/state-of-digital-transformation-healthcare/ ). Through the development of databases and other applications, ICTs provide the capacity to improve health system efficiencies and prevent medical errors (Digital economy report 2019, value creation and capture: implications for developing countries, https://www.unctad/der/2019 ). The aim of this paper is to justify/examine how and what could be done in a sustainable and inclusive manner through the use of innovation to achieve the sustainable development goals through ICTs. This paper examines, the enormous potential for leveraging the digital economy as a driver of sustainable and inclusive growth in Africa. The authors of this paper conclude that further research on the digital economy and increased awareness of e-health coupled with pilot activities would help in better implementing SDG#3 and other related SDGs to enhance the impact of innovation in health on sustainable development and growth.

In the framework of digital transformation of social space an important and relevant topic for higher educational institutions is the creation of high-quality information and communication environment, which shall correspond to the contemporary state of science and technology development, global educational standards and information society needs. The advantages of the Moodle system are studied. Moodle system provides for a comprehensive educational process through its extensive educational content, a system for control, monitoring and evaluating the knowledge quality. The authors compare the four-phased model of knowledge management with the capacities of LMS Moodle educational environment. The latter is capable of simulating professional actions in a virtual educational space that allows the university to train advanced specialists and ensure a high level of their professional skills based on hard and soft skills. The perceptive and cognitive attitude of university students and teachers towards the implementation of the LMS Moodle educational platform was researched. The research has brought out the subjective assessment model of the innovative process with clear meaningful factors of changes' perception. Such a model allows understanding the collective attitude to the university's policy and highlighting mental settings necessary for working with human resources within the social adaptation and diffusion of innovation. The synergy of technological and managerial innovations has been updated to ensure completeness and efficiency in presenting a professional educational product based on the LMS Moodle platform. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.},

In Vietnam, the government and the ministry of education and training started a plan to transform leading universities into digital universities. The first question for this process is which key factors of the university are affected by the digital transformation. And what the readiness in human resources of the university for the digital transformation. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the characteristics of the digital university model to identify the criteria for assessing the availability of the digital transformation process. This study contributes to a better understanding of four basic facets of the digital university: Education Program, Learners, Training Services, and Governance. A survey-based quantitative study for the readiness of digital university was conducted among the students and the staff of Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. The results of this study allow us to introduce a readiness framework for digital transformation as a reference for the other higher education institutions.

There are cooperation, mobility, and research programs to help and support institutions development. However, the Fourth Industrial Revolution brings a disruptive scenario, challenging these institutions to go beyond academic cooperation and undergo a digital transformation, offering answers to this new revolution that is changing the world in never-before-seen form and speed. Tools and approaches originated in the business sector may help higher education institutions to promote their digital transformation. Nevertheless, these institutions have characteristics that differentiate them from the traditional managerial business. Moreover, these characteristics are a source of tensions, night tigers that are adversaries but invisible on a day-to-day transformation activity, impacting the digital transformation process.

All curricular innovations should undergo curriculum evaluation; hence, the objective of this paper was to share the salient features of evaluation using faculty and student's feedback on curricular adaptations implemented through digital transformation in a Medical School in Arabian Gulf during the COVID-19 pandemic, using a structured questionnaire. Methodology: After getting informed consent, feedback about acceptability and limitations regarding various aspects of curricular adaptations was obtained from students and faculty, using a structured and validated questionnaire. The response rate from faculty and students was 90% and 60%, respectively. The qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: About 97% agreed that Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment, ZOOM, and Examsoft platforms were effective for curriculum delivery and assessment. 85% agreed that they were able to maintain online interactivity and 92% conveyed their willingness to continue to use these digital innovations even after the end of pandemic. 'Lack of interactivity,' 'missed clinical training,' 'live sessions were more engaging than recorded ones' were the prominent themes emerged out of thematic analysis. All faculty and students expressed concern over the lack of clinical training involving real patients. All of them expressed appreciation to the university and faculty for their enormous efforts. Conclusion: Innovative ways should be considered to start clinical teaching with real patients, during pandemic. The learning outcomes of digital learning should be validated across all institutions. New indicators related to 'digital learning' should be considered for accreditation of medical schools. © MEDKNOW 2020. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The world is changing at a very fast pace- in terms of culture, education, complexities of societal needs and demands. The educator with his past learning cannot match the expectations of the millennials. The VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) in Engineering Education has to be observed, studied, analysed and reformed and that too very soon. Higher Education is unable to evolve in pace with the technological developments, global economics, and digital transformations. Global networking has shrunk the world and established inter-connectedness breaking barriers of language, geography, societal cultures, and perceptions. However such rapid changes have not impacted Engineering Education much. Academicians prophecies about attributes that an engineer should possess are turning volatile. This uncertainty leads to unemployed engineers. The chaos has emerged with various levels of complexities. With under-skilled employees, the future of the Engineers and Engineering Education looks bleak and ambiguous. Jack of all trades will have more employable possibilities than the Master of a particular skill. The faculty who teach the 21st Century Learner therefore must make a conscious, intentional choice to enhance his competencies to prepare students for the future. This study emphasizes the need to reawaken our educational policies and teaching-learning pedagogy. Certain learning strategies like flipped learning, project-based learning, problem-based learning will adapt the andragogic method. The teaching trends will be metamorphosed and establish good networking for inter/transdisciplinary research. Case studies and scenario building will churn in opportunities for the students to communicate, collaborate, critically think, and be creative. The empowered faculty will have his multi-skilled students placed well, the student will be industry ready and the industry will have the employee come along with his 21st Century skill set. The beneficiaries: the school, university, teacher now a facilitator, the student and the community at large will build not only a sustainable future but a thriving one too!. © 2020 The Authors.

The study has as the objective to identify the aspects of consumer demand for educational services in the process of testing the conceptual model of mobile learning adapted to the modern business environment in the context of digital transformations of the socio-economic life. The concept of an educational course based on the Sakai mobile learning platform with a focus on the formation of digital literacy in the business segment has been proposed in the study. The educational and applied course “Entrepreneurship in the Digital Mode” was tested within the educational programs of the State University of Management (Lyubertsy, Russia) and Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia (St. Petersburg, Russia). The experiment made it possible to identify key aspects of consumer demand for distance education based on the characteristics of the participants’ perception of the advantages and effectiveness of mobile learning. Most participants confirmed their professional achievements and the fact of the implementation of personal educational goals. Mobile learning was described as an easy, comfortable, interesting, innovative and modern method of learning compared to traditional classroom lessons. In the process of mobile learning, students demonstrated an increase in personal responsibility and self-organization while practical classes and the synergy of the educational content with real business cases greatly contributed to their involvement and productivity. Until now, research has not dealt with real measurable in terms of real income from specific activities, the results of the application of mobile learning.

	abstract = {Purpose: To study the experience of digitalization of educational activities of higher educational institutions, develop recommendations on the choice and implementation of digital transformation strategies in universities. Design/Methodology/Approach: Digital changes taking place in the educational services market radically change approaches to the implementation of the educational process, thereby causing the need to review strategic tasks and establish priority areas for digital development. The choice of digital transformation strategies should be based, inter alia, on determining the current level of digitalization and analyzing key factors in the internal environment of universities. An assessment of the level of digitalization can be carried out using a system of indicators that allow you to determine possible areas of strategic development and the necessary tactical measures for their implementation. Results: The authors reviewed the experience and formalized the main directions of strategic development of universities in the field of digitalization of educational activities. It was shown that the key factors of the internal environment, which determine the possible choice of strategies for the digital development of educational activities of universities, can be: the achieved technical and technological level of digitalization of the educational environment and the level of competence of higher-education teaching personnel in the field of digital technologies and the use of remote educational technologies. It was revealed that these factors are interconnected and determine the possibility of implementing the chosen strategy of digitalization of educational activities at a certain level of their development. There are offered groups of indicators allowing to assess the achieved level of digitalization. The necessary conditions and tactical measures to implement the selected strategies of digital transformations are defined. Originality/Value: The results of the research and the recommendations proposed on their basis can be used in the practice of developing and implementing strategies for digitalizing the educational process in higher educational institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Higher education institutions (HEIs) nowadays shall generate human, knowledge and entrepreneurial capital; hence, incorporating a third mission and becoming more entrepreneurial. The process of developing a third mission requires HEIs to pursue governance, education and ecosystem entrepreneurial pathways by applying dynamic capabilities to sense, seize and transform themselves through leadership and establishment of shared vision. Key drivers for the future development of entrepreneurial HEIs are internationalization, digitalization and co-creation with ecosystem actors. However, the ongoing world pandemic and the extensive restrictions on mobility affect HEIs’ internationalization strategy development and implementation. At the same time, it ignites a chase for novel digital formats that shall deliver HEIs’ three missions effectively and sustainably. The present case study illustrates how the adoption of dynamic capabilities and effectual principles enabled the timely transformation of a traditional student mobility project into a novel digital format. The new format was co-created through quadruple-helix interactions (i.e. university, industry, government and civil society interactions) to provide bachelor students with a unique action-learning experience and partner institutions with a low-barrier open innovation industry-university collaboration format. Public and non-governmental organizations provided innovation challenges that were tackled by international interdisciplinary student teams, in a virtual module that is part of their regular curriculum. These teams were supported by a multi-disciplinary team of educators and external partners from industry. The results from the first pilot, which included forty-one students from eight countries and three partner organizations, demonstrate that the original goal of the project – to internationalize the HEI’s third mission – was effectively achieved, as all stakeholders involved perceived added value through their engagement. Furthermore, the teaching provided promoted students’ entrepreneurial mindset and global citizenship. Thus, this case exemplifies how the application of current theories and frameworks on third mission advancement supports HEIs’ management practice, demonstrating the importance of employing dynamic capabilities and effectual practices.},

	abstract = {From a managerial perspective, the rapid diffusion of actions and strategies accelerating the digital transformation of institutions is critical for success. However, in education, business, and management studies, digital transformation can be understood as simple evolutionary processes that enable business models, operational processes, and experiences to be made quickly and efficiently by institutions and agents. This aspect can sometimes lead to opposition, especially when little information is available or in situations of high uncertainty. This research aims to evaluate the involvement of an institutional ecosystem in the digital transformation at universities. Using data collected in Chile, this paper analyzes how the adoption of technologies by universities provides a context for understanding digitalization, measured by the IAU World Higher Education Database (UNESCO). The main finding of this paper is that there is a wide and relevant range of impacts of technological change in higher education institutions, particularly in the categories of values and operations. Additionally, this work serves as a repository of knowledge applicable to similar situations considering the specificities of each particular case. The importance to intervene in relation to certain variables at different levels of managerial performance is described and the implications for higher education institutions are discussed in these pages. © 2021 by the authors.

The second article outlines the features of the double transition ‒ energy and digital ‒ to a climate-neutral economy. Germany is carrying it out within the framework of the European Green Deal, the adoption of which almost coincided with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus crisis has become a catalyst for the transformation processes in the field of energy and digitalization, many of which Berlin began to implement long before the onset of its consequences. Lockdowns have led to a reduction in industry's primary energy and electricity consumption, motivated businesses to relocate employees to home-based work, and accelerate the introduction of new digital technologies. The coronavirus crisis has become a challenge for government departments, healthcare institutions, secondary and higher education, which management and employees were not ready for a quick use of distance technologies. The author analyzes the structural policy of the coalition government, the contribution of German-French initiatives and projects to the implementation of the double transition in the field of energy, cloud technologies and artificial intelligence, assesses the role of a new Climate Protection Law. © 2021 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {The paper considers the problem of developing a lecturer's readiness for innovative pedagogical activity. The authors determined its main components-axiological, neological, and praxeological ones and outline some specific features of their content in the context of digitalization of education. Motivational-and-axiological, cognitive and activity-based components have been distinguished in the structure of digital competence. The paper shows the role of readiness for innovative activities in the transprofessionalization of a modern lecturer. Digital competence is seen as one of the fundamental features of a transprofessional. The authors present study results of the level of digital competence development in lecturers of Russian State Agrarian University-Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. The study has shown that all the components of the digital competence of a lecturer were not sufficiently formed. To compensate for these shortcomings, advanced training was organized for university lecturers under the program Electronic Information-and-Educational Environment of the University. Taking into account the results obtained, the authors have offered the main ways of improving the digital competence of lecturers: Digital transformation of the educational environment in the university, improving the content of further professional education programs by including the development of the digital competence of lecturers as an invariant component, organizing further professional training programs in an electronic information-and-educational environment, and providing methodological and coaching support for the innovative activities of lecturers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study examined the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in labor productivity dynamics. The following ICT components were analyzed: the share of organizations using computers and the share of organizations using the internet. The purpose of the study was to analyze labor productivity in the Russian economy in the context of digital transformation, taking into account two dimensions: temporal and spatial. We investigated the impact of organizations’ use of ICT on labor productivity, the relationship between labor productivity and high-tech production, and spatial effects in the dynamics of labor productivity. We used a spatial autoregressive model (SAR) and a panel vector autoregressive model (PVAR) to analyze data for the period 2010–2018. The findings show that digitalization of business processes and an increase in the share of organizations using internet technologies leads to an increase in labor productivity. Certain socioeconomic indicators were also found to be significant, namely, real wages and the percentage of people with higher education in the workforce. Exogenous variables acting as external shocks did not exert significant effects. The results have important implications for managers who develop strategies to increase labor productivity and production efficiency. Such strategies should focus on internetization, business digitalization, and e-commerce. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The digitalization of higher education is a long-term trend that gained a new impetus for further development because of the forced transition to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the article is to analyze the impact of digital transformation on the educational process in universities and to describe the risks through the students' eyes. The analysis is based on the results of a survey conducted by the authors in 2020 among students of two universities - Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and the Institute of the Trade Union Movement of the General Confederation of Labor of Vietnam (IPLV). The article describes the methodology of the online survey. The attitude towards distance learning is interpreted as a three-level attitude with emotional, cognitive and behavioral aspects. It is suggested that students' readiness to switch to distance learning is determined by a set of macro and micro factors. Among the macro factors are the national specifics of the educational system, traditions in the field of higher education, infrastructure, the national educational policy, and the mobilization potential of the population. Among the micro factors are the cognitive and other psychological characteristics of the students, the socio-psychological openness to innovation. According to the survey results, there is certain similarity in the way Russian and Vietnamese students assess their experience of distance learning. At the same time, significant differences in the perception of the outcome of the digital transformation of education have been revealed. For MGIMO students, major risks are associated with dehumanization, the severing of social ties, and the possible loss of student status. For Vietnamese students the most significant risks are mainly associated with the fears of the decreasing quality of education. It is therefore concluded that distance learning is both the field of opportunities and possible source of individual and institutional risks. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

	abstract = {The integration of innovative data mining and decision-making techniques in the context of higher education is a bold initiative towards enhanced performance. Predictive and descriptive analytics add interesting insights for significant aspects the education. The purpose of this article is to summarize a novel approach for the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques towards forecasting of academic performance. The added value of applying AI techniques for advanced decision making in education is the realization that the scientific approach to standard problems in academia, like the enhancement of academic performance is feasible. For the purpose of this research the authors promote a research in Saudi Arabia. The vision of the Knowledge Society in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a critical milestone towards digital transformation. The human capital and the integration of industry and academia has to be based on holistic approaches to skills and competencies management. One of the main objectives of an academic decision maker is to ensure that academic resources are adequately planned and that students are properly advised. To achieve such an objective, an extensive analysis of large volumes of data may be required. This research develops a decision support system (DSS) that is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can be deployed for effective academic planning and advising. The system is based on evaluating academic metrics against academic performance for students. The model integrates inputs from relevant academic data sources into an autonomous ANN. A simulation of real data on an ANN is conducted to validate the system's accuracy. Moreover, an ANN is compared with different mathematical approaches. The system enables the quality assurance of planning, advising, and the monitoring of academic decisions. The overall contribution of this work is a novel approach to the deployment of Artificial Intelligent for advanced decision making in higher education. In future work this model is integrated with big data and analytics research for advanced visualizations. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is an undeniable reality, and its impact is widespread and global. The digital transformation crosses not only the different sectors and economic activities but also society in general. In this setting, the higher education sector is no exception being continuously affected by advances in digital technologies, which contribute to significant, sometimes drastic, changes in education and training. Therefore, and considering two of the main actors in teaching-learning environment (students and teachers) it can be said that on the one hand, students expect to find dynamic teaching environments enriched with technology. On the other hand, teachers gain by using new tools that not only facilitate content sharing but also lead to greater student motivation among other aspects of the teaching-learning process. As mentioned, technological updates are constant and, consequently, teachers in general, and those in higher education, have the imperative to accompany these same updates and introduce them into the teaching-learning process. Thus, to meet this challenge, teachers themselves must take on the role of students and train and update themselves. Taking advantage of Digital Transformation technology facilitators and realizing the need for updated approaches to address the training of higher education teachers, we propose the use of a model to guide teachers training within Digital Transformation. The approach is a combination of three models that will be applied to Higher Education Teachers Training (HET2). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Results highlight the relevance of both technological and cultural aspects that supported the digital transformation during the crisis. The dimensions of digital readiness and cultural openness, together with a defined strategic orientation, represented relevant facilitators of the digital innovation process. In turn, digital innovation had important implications for sustainability, which was fostered by increasing the accessibility to quality education and addressed as a topic of many of the digital contents delivered. Thus, the study contributes to the stream of research that investigates how digital innovation in HEIs and other public administrations happens and how such an innovation can support sustainability.

To undergo such a serious transition Russian companies of any business scope need to provide the full-scale readiness of the whole system. Digital transformation without the elaborated high-quality preparation of all system elements and connections may turn out to be an untimely expensive measure hindering company’s development. There are analyzed the obstacles defined as part of the study and related to digital transformation of economy and education. Education is viewed as a leading factor of socio-economic development. Thus, the request for implementation of digital transformation is addressed primarily to education. The study raises a problem of lack of a well-founded psychological and pedagogical concept of digital learning which could be used by the subjects of education as the basic one. The results of the survey conducted among university students majoring in public management have shown the following: it is necessary to expand professional competences of modern managers needed for carrying out the activity in the epoch of digital revolution; there emerges the question about rational inclusion into public management university curricula the disciplines corresponding to real demands of the labor market. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Background: Today's medical students are growing up in a digital age in which the use of smartphones and smart devices is now irrevocably part of professional life. However, the abilities to use these devices that have become so ubiquitous in private life can only be partially transferred to work with patients and the medical setting. Since little is known about digitalization in medical education, the aim of this paper is to gain an overview of the current training in digital competencies at Swiss universities. Methods: The medical deans at all Swiss universities were contacted by telephone and informed about an online survey. The invitation to fill out the Survey Monkey questionnaire was subsequently sent by email to the specific contacts at each university. The survey consisted of questions to be answered using a defined scale and open-ended questions. The survey's focus, topics involving digital competencies, is based on the content in the Principal Relevant Objectives and Framework for Integrative Learning and Education in Switzerland (PROFILES) and the National Competency-based Catalogue of Learning Objective in Undergraduate Medicine (NKLM). Results: All of the dean's offices that were contacted participated in the survey. The topics on digitalization were all rated as relevant or very relevant. Our survey shows a heterogeneous picture in terms of implementing PROFILE and NKLM content. A few universities have well-established educational approaches or even implemented curricula, but often these are still in development. Participants also mentioned factors that are necessary for successfully setting up and implementing curricula dealing with digitalization and factors that can impede such efforts. Conclusion: The importance of acquiring digital competencies during medical study is known and recognized by all Swiss medical schools. Curricular integration varies in its progress and represents major challenges for the medical faculties. It is precisely the inclusion of students in such efforts that may be a potential response to this challenge. Copyright © 2020 Hautz et al.; Hintergrund: Die derzeitigen Medizinstudierenden wachsen in einem digitalen Zeitalter auf, aus dem der Umgang mit Smartphones und Smart Devices im beruflichen Alltag nicht mehr wegzudenken ist. Die Fähigkeiten im Umgang mit diesen Devices, die im privaten Alltag wie selbstverständlich angewendet werden, lassen sich jedoch nur teilweise auf die Arbeit mit Patienten und das medizinisch-professionelle Umfeld übertragen. Da bisher wenig zum Thema Digitalisierung im Medizinstudium bekannt ist, ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit, einen Überblick über die derzeitige Ausbildung in digitalen Kompetenzen an den Universitäten der Schweiz zu erhalten.Methoden: Die medizinischen Dekanate aller Schweizer Universitäten wurden telefonisch kontaktiert, mit dem Hinweis auf eine Online Umfrage. Die Einladung für diese in Survey Monkey implementierte Umfrage wurde im Anschluss per E-Mail an die entsprechenden Ansprechpartner verschickt und bestand aus einem Skalenanteil und Freitextfragen. Der in der Umfrage abgefragte Themenkomplex „digitale Kompetenzen“ orientiert sich an den Inhalten, wie sie im Principal Relevant Objectives and Framework for Integrative Learning and Education in Switzerland (PROFILES) und dem Nationalen Kompetenzbasierten Lernzielkatalog Medizin (NKLM) genannt werden.Ergebnisse: Alle befragten Dekanate haben an der Umfrage teilgenommen. Die genannten Themen aus dem Bereich der Digitalisierung werden allesamt als relevant oder sehr relevant bewertet. Unsere Umfrage zeigt ein heterogenes Bild bezüglich der Umsetzung dieser Inhalte. An wenigen Universitäten ist eine gut etablierte oder sogar curricular implementierte Ausbildung vorhanden, oft aber ist sie im Aufbau. Zusätzlich benannten die Teilnehmer förderliche und hinderliche Faktoren bezüglich des Aufbaus und der Umsetzung curricularer Implementation zum Thema Digitalisierung.Schlussfolgerung: Die Bedeutung des Erwerbs digitaler Kompetenzen im Rahmen des Medizinstudiums ist allen medizinischen Fakultäten in der Schweiz bekannt. Die curriculare Integration ist unterschiedlich weit fortgeschritten und stellt die Fakultäten vor große Herausforderungen. Gerade der Einbezug Studierender in die entsprechende Lehre scheint eine mögliche Antwort auf diese Herausforderung zu sein.},

	abstract = {Knowledge management evaluation is an important and complex problem in Peruvian universities. An efficient policy in knowledge management is a critical success factor and will also advance teaching and research. Likewise, innovation is a key resource for the well-being of national economies and international competitive advantage, especially with COVID-19 9 restrictions. This research article has demonstrated that an assessment of knowledge management (KM) capability in two private universities could be used for an efficient policy, in order to obtain the best result in knowledge management maturity. Having discussed how to construct a model for KM, the final section of this paper addresses ways of the incorporation of this technology in the society. The case study has been developed in Lima, associated to two universities with 271 teachers and 5928 students; with this model could be used for KM assessment in all university in Peru. This study uses the “Intellectus Model, Mejia model organizational knowledge capability areas and Knowledge Management Capability Assessment (KMCA) model for the assessment, before and during COVID-19. Our findings have demonstrated the university performance and challenges associated to knowledge management during COVID-19, the new policy for virtual instructions and digital transformation of the educational process have improved the cost efficiencies. However, this system also has a number of serious drawbacks and challenges in innovation, researching, connections with industry and academy; this 2021 requires a new perspective in innovation with a knowledge management scheme in Peruvian universities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {One of the most important elements of Industry 4.0 and digitalization is human. The change of technological infrastructures and processes will also change the qualities sought in human resources concomitantly. Requirements of the digital world will replace the existing knowledge and experience. For this reason, whether white- or blue-collar employees must acquire the competence and skills that will meet these requirements. While the existing processes show the characteristic of change; the white-collar personnel to manage these processes should be compatible with this transformation and well equipped with the capability of managing the relevant processes. On the other hand, although the number of blue-collar employees is expected to decrease; a great need for more qualified practitioners compatible with the digital world will arise. It is obvious that short term on-the-job trainings will not be sufficient. This is the duty of universities as well as the private sector. Beyond the programs of the existing vocational and technical education high schools and universities, the need is obvious for raising specialists that will implement and manage the digital technology and design it, if necessary. It was planned to establish a “digital transformation training/application center” totally within the scope of digital technology and Industry 4.0, in order to ensure that the students receive their trainings within the real system both from the trainers and practitioners in a practical way. In this study which is about the problem of selecting a site for this center, the selection criteria were determined by considering these needs and requirements. A novel hybrid methodology is applied in this study for the problem of multiple criteria decisions making. DEMATEL method is used to determine the weight of the criteria and the COPRAS method is used to evaluate the alternatives based on these weighted criteria and select the site of establishment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The digitalization of economic relations determines the particular importance of personnel training on a qualitatively new technological basis, which is inextricably linked with the study of the problem of ecosystem designing for the development of universities in a digital environment. The foundations of the systems theory, the theory of education economics, the methods of system analysis, factor analysis, and economic and mathematical modeling were used for studying the problem of ecosystem development for universities. The conducted studies made it possible to obtain the following main research results: the ecosystem principles for organizing the provision of higher education services, representing the integrity of the university system based on network interactions of a set of various participants, as well as objects, projects, processes, and environments, were proposed. An approach to designing a strategy for the development of universities, based on the scenario forecasting of the receptivity of digital economy competencies by students, teachers, and partners of universities in the medium term, is proposed based on the organigram for the implementation of the project of matrix digital transformation of the adhocratic university hierarchy. The conclusions stating that the design of the ecosystem of the development of universities should be aimed at the implementation of the social mission of the university in the region and the transformation of the ecosystem of the region as a whole are formulated. As prospects for further research, the study of the prerequisites for generating the effects of designing the development of a university ecosystem based on the network platform interaction of the economic agents of the region/territory, as well as the implementation of digital transformation projects of the university management system, is considered. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

More than ever, technology became the enabler of learning. Faculty and students quickly needed to develop new skills in the short term to finish the academic term that had been interrupted. The situation required integral digital transformation. The purpose of this document is to present the status of a doctoral-thesis research plan for creating a university digital transformation model supported by the measurement of media literacy. We propose a mixed study with a concurrent-triangulation, sequential-explanatory design that allows us to analyze quantitative and qualitative results and consider the impact of technologies that support media literacy on professors and digital education production teams within university programs. The expected results will lead to proposing a university digital transformation model that supports media literacy development in the academic community and training for the labor market in the digital age. The document is organized in nine sections: context and motivation that drives the dissertation research, state of the art, hypothesis, research objectives, research approach, and methods, results to date and their validity, dissertation status, expected contributions, and conclusions.

	abstract = {In this introductory essay, we build on the articles in this special issue to provide a novel theoretical framework for the understanding of current and future trends in the digitalisation of teaching and learning in Nordic higher education (HE). We highlight three key elements. Context is critical and should be systematically expanded to include not only the immediate context of the virtual and blended classroom, but also the broader organisational and national contexts within which digital learning takes place. The involvement of individual actors, higher education institutions and national policy-making agencies in the development and implementation of digitalisation policy ideas and practices is also shaped by multiple mediations, which include the mediating role of technology itself, but also of other human, organisational and policy actors, ideas and practices. Finally, digitalisation of HE teaching and learning can lead to a variety of gradual or more radical digital transformations, operating at multiple scales and with multiple potential positive or negative effects. This framework helps put into focus the key question of how to go about searching for a flexible set of “Nordic characteristics” that might affect digitalisation of teaching and learning in the Nordic region, albeit in uneven and diverse ways. While it is too early to provide a systematic analysis of the impact of the rapid digitalisation of Nordic HE teaching and learning spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, we make some preliminary observations that offer this emerging theoretical framework as a way to assess these trends both before and after the pandemic. © 2020.

	abstract = {As a result of the research the following spheres of influence of virtual environment on the university were defined: professional, environmental, functional. Exogenous and endogenous factors of information and communication technologies affecting universities were identified. In order to increase the efficiency of the educational process in the university it was proposed to introduce SMART-complexes of disciplines. The structure of SMART-complexes of disciplines is established, consisting of the following modules: definition of the level of learning, assessment of learning efficiency, content for adaptive learning, tasks for adaptive learning, a set of databases for storing learning profiles, a knowledge base with a mechanism for logical output. Detailed components of the educational SMART-complexes guide students in their learning activities to correctly find the tasks that are most appropriate and necessary at present, to effectively define strategies and methods of learning, taking into account their personal factors. A methodology for assessing the digitalization level of a university based on fuzzy logic as a tool for managing processes of the digital transformation of the educational process is proposed. The following groups of indicators were identified to assess the digitalization level of the university: digital literacy of teachers, digital literacy of students and digitalization of the educational process. Assessing the digitalization level of the university will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the educational process, justify the necessary effective management decisions. The main directions of state policy for digitalization of education have been defined. The need to create a comprehensive national system for the development of digital literacy, combining the efforts of academic and non-formal education on the basis of public-private partnership has been stressed. The most important function of traditional higher education institutions remains the socialization of students, so in order to improve the quality of education, it is appropriate to use mixed learning through various forms of education. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The purpose of the study was to develop and test personnel support indices for digitalization of the economy, as well as to identify social and economic factors that significantly affect the level of personnel support for the processes of digital transformation of the economy. The authors applied data from the official statistical reporting of the Russian Federation. The proposed staffing indices were modeled as objective functions depending on socio-economic factors characterizing the development of the economy in different dimensions. At the same time, the indices themselves were calculated as values in which the parameters of the output of digital specialists and their relevance in the economy were correlated. In the course of the study, a comparison of statistical and neural network data modeling methods and generalizing indices was performed. An analysis of the obtained regression models and an analysis of the sensitivity of trained neural networks made it possible to evaluate their accuracy in predicting the trends in the staffing of the digital economy and to identify factors that significantly affect the achievement of the goal of matching the output of specialists and the demands of economic sectors. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

	abstract = {In 2016-2018 the state in Russia adopted a package of program documents, which implies the transfer of education to the large-scale introduction of digital technologies. This phenomenon has been called “digitalization of education”. In scientific literature, electronization and digitalization are increasingly called one of the institutional traps for the development of Russian universities, since the corresponding institutional environment has not yet been formed due to the forced nature of innovations. As a result, the processes of introducing new technologies into education are still not regulated. Within the framework of the purpose of the study, the manifestations of the trap of electronization and digitalization of Russian higher education were analyzed on the basis of sociological data, and the theoretical modeling of the process of adaptation of educational agents to the institution of digitalization was carried out. In the course of the study, the approaches were summarized that have been developed in discussions on educational digitalization. The article presents the author's vision of the studied phenomenon as an institutional trap; as well as understanding of the institutional features and characteristics of electronization and digitalization in education. The research method is the analysis of estimates obtained in the course of an expert survey which was conducted by the Vologda Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences among the representatives of the teaching staff of state universities in the Vologda region. In the course of this analysis, the indicators of educational digitalization as an effective innovation were clarified such as an increased accessibility of educational resources; simplification of communication and the process of transferring knowledge from teacher to student; increased opportunities for training specialists for the new (digital) economy; improving the quality of education in universities, etc. Based on the results of the empirical study, it has been determined that the conditions for the development of digitalization in Russian universities are currently ambiguous, which is closely related to the level of competitiveness of the educational organization. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the presentation of an original matrix describing the process of university employees adaptation to the conditions of digital transformation of education. The matrix is proposed on the basis of a sociological analysis of the impact of the trap of electronization and digitalization on the activities of educational agents. The matrix can be taken into account in the practice of higher education management. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University. All rights reserved.},

This paper draws on two theoretical frameworks: Laurillard's conversational framework and Salmon's five-stage model. The first highlights the experimental, exploratory and creative aspects of developing an overall framework to structure the digital learning environment for teachers-as-researchers. The second explores the future of higher education and systems like T-REX in the era of digital transformation and the emerging context of Education 4.0. The original contribution is the integration of these frameworks in the creation of an open and shared learning platform so that schools and teachers can be supported to access, collaborate in and undertake research. In particular, the paper outlines signature features of the T-REX design and the way it has emerged over the last 5 years as an innovative platform to mediate the fusion of research and teaching in education. The paper highlights key issues and challenges in unbundling the traditional university, particularly in the context of educational research, but also the imperative of doing so, in the emerging era of Education 4.0. © 2021 Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET).

	abstract = {The article presents proposals for the organization of targeted selection of personnel for their subsequent training for enterprises of the mineral resource cluster of the region. Special emphasis is placed on training future specialists who are potentially positioned to solve engineering problems and master mining technologies in the context of digital transformation of the economy. The relevance is confirmed by the processes of digitalization of the economy, active use of social networks and network services by young people, which requires changes in conceptual certainty and correction of the validity of professional self-determination and professional orientation. The main task is to develop technological mechanisms for the implementation of professional self-determination and professional orientation of young people in the conditions of digital modernization of the economy. A new model of complex professional orientation and professional self-determination of young people in the educational territorial ecosystem created on the basis of professional connections, acting on the basis of the results of data analysis obtained during the processing of digital user profiles, is proposed. Expected results are the following: the concept of expanding a multi-level intelligent IT platform for a geographically distributed model of professional orientation and professional self-determination of young people; principles of modeling psychological, physiological and cognitive features of a social network user (potential University applicants) based on their digital footprint for solving problems of individualization of the learning process; algorithm for working with the data obtained to form an individual trajectory of personal development. Such approaches will allow changing the idea of professional self-determination as a temporary process at a certain stage of personal development, prolonging activities for the formation and change of career for the entire professional activity of the individual, and ensure the reproduction of highly qualified personnel for the mining industry in the region. © 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {Signal imitation is widely used today since it helps to bring the experiment to the virtual domain thus eliminating risks of damaging real equipment. At the same time all signals used in the physical world are limited by the finite band of frequencies rendering bandpass signal studies especially important. The method for imitating bandpass signals in complex basis is favorable in the case of a bandpass signal as it uses resources effectively and provides the desired accuracy. The author has implemented the method in the form of the PC application generating signals according to the characteristics set by the user. These characteristics are: borders defining the signal's frequency band, the time period, the number of steps for discretization, the spectral density form. The PC application uses the characteristics to generate the signal and its experimental autocorrelation. The application calculates theoretic and algorithmic autocorrelations in order to evaluate the quality of the imitation by computing the error function. The application visualizes all the resulting information via the simple interface. The application was used to generate two-dimensional signals to highlight the present limitations and to sketch the direction for the future. The application is later to be adapted completely to imitating multidimensional signals.

Both internal and external factors have large impact on higher education students. Since many students' inability to learn with new learning process, that is not affected by their competence or skills, but by their inability to use the required technology. In accordance with the current pandemic situation, it prompts the organization to transform its business process more technology savvy, including in the higher education institution as an organization that responsible to educate student. The phenomenon of Covid 19 pandemic drives many studies to check the readiness of digital transformation. The most important factor for higher education can adapt with this situation is that they must analyse the current condition to shift into the new digital learning process. Therefore, this study focusses to find out the biggest factor in the scope of digital gaps from student side. This study uses various data description analysis techniques to examine the hypotheses. The result shows that most students encounter problems due to their inability to adapt to certain digital technology tools, and their limited financial capacity seems to affect their learning process. Other data shows that online learning is not as effective as offline learning due to the student's needs to learn both the new digital technology platform and the necessary materials. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.

	abstract = {The article presents an overview of digital transformation challenges concerning labor relations, workforce and social safety net programs regulations, with focus on the IT skills shortage, limited digital proficiency, the widening gap between college graduates and labor market needs. The current debate is for the most part being focused on the declining demand for labor force. And much more attention should be devoted to the ways digitalization is changing the structure of jobs and shifting the demand for skills. Though young people are more likely than older workers to have digital skills, a large number of them also join those who neither be employed, nor in education or training. And among new forms of employment, many of them do not qualify for different benefits which traditionally go along with the job place, such as employer-sponsored pension plans, health insurance, etc., and demand new social guarantees. So, the lack of government policy in bridging digital divide between the labor qualification and the demand for new skills among different groups of population (by age, income, other factors) may retard national digital development. Existing institutions and regulation systems need to be modernized in order to respond to digital changes. The federal agency on the digital platform should have wide range of functions, providing a framework that outlines key goals and objectives to ensure building digital entrepreneurial ecosystems; to aid, counsel, assist and protect employees, identifying key trends at the national and regional levels. Among the main directions of such agency’s activities – reskilling and training programs to prepare people for the employment challenges in partnership with business and colleges; through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations. © 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Digital Transformation (DT) Inside Higher Education (HE): In the new era, on the way to the IV Industrial Revolution corporations of all classes, are focused on the massive and optimal practice of ICT in different organizational plans including human talent, organizational configurations, processes, inputs, outcomes, services and obviously the industry model. Nowadays, 70% of the top companies have robust DT Teams, and 40% of them are driven by high ICT and Artificial and Computational Intelligence (AI, CI). In other hand, very few Colombian Universities (U) have undertaken the problem of competitiveness in HE, much less have attempted to face the IV Industrial Revolution and take the jump, thus suffering a tremendous disappointment due to HE obsolescence. The U should play an important role in the reduction of the digital gap, and even more, must design new programs that face the formation of digital talent (i.e. Cyber-programmers Professional Technicians) that is required in this era, or we will belate again to change. In the recent ICT International Congress in Latin America1, numerous national cases of DT were presented from companies, but, unfortunately, not a single case from HE. ¿Will the Colombian computerization case be replicated, which was left to the discretion of transnational computer elites? The DT of U, implies necessarily the cognimatics (the informatics for the Knowledge Society) of all the companies and their social insertion in this journey... University Architecture: Enterprise Architecture (EA): Architecting implies the organization of a system of subsystems (SoS) or constituents to obtain better and/or new functionalities. If any piece is knowledge-based, an intelligent performance is obtained. The architecture-multilayer approach is a SoS one, that ensures compliance with government policies, procedures and standards, in a highly complex establishment with intellectual capital and intelligent processes, which is a usual status quo in an academy institution; defines the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is made-up, and with the protocols by which they communicate. EA and University Architecture provide an industry 360° vision map, and organization structure for business and technological changes. EA is used as a system overall configuration of subsystems or components organized in layers, where each one describes an ordered audience of structures and common functionalities assembled by a purposeful criterion inside the HE institutions. As purposes we present a succinct outline of our architectural DT model of the digital university transformation. The pillars of the architecture are: finance, innovation and investigation, entrepreneurship and social projection; recognizing from the start, that knowledge has its ethos in the U; they correspond to: 1- Productive ecosystem of the DT. 2- DT that enhances the knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capacities throughout the institution. 3- A new economy that requires technology transformation also supported on entrepreneurship. 4- New DT human talent required by the new IA and knowledge industry. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills, bio-data, socioeconomic conditions and family composition, is required. We discuss the basic and conceptual aspects, and methodological dimension for the DT, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented during the last 10 years at FESSANJOSE2 leading the DT in HE. © 2018 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

	abstract = {A major challenge faced by organisations today is how to adopt and leverage new digital technologies (NDT), as it requires organizations and its leaders to embrace different mindsets and skill-sets in order to develop digital transformation strategies. In this scenario, how can universities support the formation of organisations' digital mindset? How to educate students to be (digital) transformational agents? And how to produce value for all stakeholders in the process? The Triple Helix (TH) of University-Industry-Government enables a sustainable innovation ecosystem and promotes regional development. The entrepreneurial university (EUni) supports the transition from a society based on physical artefacts to a knowledge-based society. The EUni model includes increased university autonomy and greater involvement of external stakeholders. At the same time, Entrepreneurship Education (EE) at EUnis has expanded and evolved significantly in the past decades. In 2006 a European Commission report on how to build a knowledge-society, added EE as one of eight key competences for life-long learning, due to the transferability of the entrepreneurial mindset to other branches of one's professional and personal life. Based on learnings from project-based EE programs with industry partners in different contexts (e.g., local/international, classroom-only/virtual-component), a novel educational concept that deep dives into the topics Entrepreneurship & Digital Transformation is being developed through co-creation, as an attempt to answer the presented questions. A specific evaluation framework assesses the experiment, by collecting qualitative and quantitative data throughout the development process, while in parallel an empirical research is aggregating findings from past and current EE programmes. Initial findings presented in this paper illustrate the need of Triple Helix (TH) interactions to co-create programs that produce value for all stakeholders, allowing the conceptualization of a novel approach for EE development, which might enable technology transfer, emergence of start-ups/spin-offs and foster an entrepreneurial mindset. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

Students spend the majority of their time on their laptops, phones and tablets, so referring them to resourceful websites is an effective way of being digitally up to date. The creation of an online community where academic staff and students can be online discussing topics and ideas and implicitly keep the learning process going even after the classes are finished. The transformation of Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical University's communication strategy, as a part of the development of engineering education in the context of digitalization is reviewed in the article. The main characteristics of Society 5.0, Industry 4.0, sixth wave of innovation, University 4.0, University 20.35 are presented. The meaning and use of such words as 'digitalization', 'human capital', 'emotional intelligence', 'smart class', 'lifelong learning', 'university for life' and others are given. A strategic approach for promoting engineering professions in the international market of higher education based on six key principles: customer centricity, partner centricity, data governance, research and development, value and digital culture, is revealed. Different examples and numbers connected with ETU 'LETI' and Honoris United Universities by each of these key principles are given in the article. The necessity of collaboration between teaching methodology and technology, in order to enhance the interrelated quality of teaching and learning for effective digital transformation are shown. University communication strategy has a direct impact on the development of the University and on key indicators that are formulated in the system of assessing the activities of the University at the State and international level. Thus, on the basis of the developed communication strategy all communications activities of the universities are carried out quite successfully and communication tools and channels are adapted to the constantly transforming portrait of the university's target audiences. © 2019 IEEE.},

The issues of transition to the digital economy are considered at the highest level: the decrees of the President of the Russian Federation created national and federal projects, including in the higher education system. But the transition to the digital environment is rather slow. The article presents an assessment of the current state and trends in the development of the domestic system of higher education, identifies the problems of transition of Russian universities to the digital educational environment. The purpose of the article is to generalize and systematize the existing developments and create a methodology for assessing the degree of universities willingness for digitalization. The authors have systematized and expanded the list of factors for assessing the willingness of universities for digital transformation. The main research methods are: expert assessment method, morphological analysis, cluster analysis. The matrix of factors and their features formed the basis for ranking indicators and forming clusters. The method proposed by the authors is universal, it has been tested at one of the Russian universities - NSTU NETI and can be applied by any institution of higher education to assess the willingness of the University for digitalization. © 2020 Moscow Polytechnic University.

However, the majority of companies also stated that, in addition to the desired process support, they observed a greater impact on individual elements of the business model. The aim of this chapter is to explain these observations and their correlations, as well as to provide an approach regarding how digital transformation could be managed systematically against the background of its impact on the business model. Thereby, the terms “Digital Business Development” and “Business Stream Matrix” are used. Building on this approach of digital transformation management, the question is raised as to whether classical management concepts are still adequate to guide companies during and after digital transformation. Where there are management gaps, this chapter substantiates approaches to close these gaps. The term “digital leadership” is used. This chapter concludes with an approach to the “sociotechnical framework”, outlining and substantiating a possible form of organization to which digital transformation tends. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

Thus, it becomes relevant to have instruments that allow the characterization of the use of these technologies in the context of higher education. This paper is the result of a more comprehensive research project and aims to analyze the students' perspective on the use of those technologies to communicate with their teachers, to investigate with what goals and functions students use the technologies, and to understand what their expectations are. To support the study, an analysis model was conceptualized and deployed in a case study conducted at a Portuguese university. Data collection was carried out through the administration of an online questionnaire to students in 2018. The results show that applications that allow interpersonal communication as well as publishing and sharing technologies are preferred by students to communicate with their teachers. In addition to the use, we analyzed the answers regarding the ease of use, expectation, attitude toward using, satisfaction, frequency of use, among other variables considered in the analysis model and presented in this paper. © 2019 The Authors.

In this regard, the authors put forward a hypothesis that the Volgograd region, being one of the leading manufacturers of agricultural products and having a huge production, resource, innovation and export potential, will be able to make a great contribution to the Russian agribusiness that will allow the Russian Federation to become a worthy competitor on the global agricultural market. To this end, the authors have identified forward-looking areas for the development of regional agribusiness in the context of digital transformation. In the course of the study, it has been found that the greatest effect from the introduction of digital tools and platforms in the agricultural sector of the region can be achieved through the formation of an industrial cluster composed of government bodies, leading enterprises, and academic institutions interested in digitalization of the industry. Valuable perspectives in this connection can be provided by the Volgograd State Agrarian University, which is capable of performing complex and knowledge-intensive development and transfer innovations at a high level, as well as training highly skilled personnel adaptive to the demands of the digital economy. Practical implications are determined by suggestions on altering the concept of regional management that assumes shifting from the process model of agribusiness to one which is an object-oriented, more stable and adaptive to transformations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The process of digital transformation is a period in which entities, universities, public and employees are transformed and; new business models and business practices are formed. Digital transformation is a functional use of web in design, manufacturing, marketing, selling, promotion and is data-oriented management model. Therefore, capabilities of firms are increased and their processes are improved. Digital technologies are developments regarding smartphones, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics systems, internet of things, 3D printing, virtualization, cyber security, sensor technologies, advanced robotics systems, automation and etc. which all is intensely used in many fields of economic and social life.SME's consist of 99,83 % total enterprises, and 72,7 % of total employment, 50,6 % of total value added and provide 55,1 % of export, take an important role in economy. They should transform their organizational structures and business making cultures starting from manufacturing technologies to management percepts as to get a productive digital transformation process. The fact that SME's being able to perform cost-benefit analysis of digital technologies and being aware of that technologies is significant.This paper provides a comprehensive view of the factors affecting digital transformation process and describes the digital transformation of the manufacturing sector in Turkey.The programs and softwares that SMEs can use to perform digital transformation, and can benefit from it, are explained. Empirical studies on SMEs shows that SMEs have erratic behaviors in terms of information and communications technology (ICT) investment and need external support to integrate digital transformations in the overall strategy of the firm. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {The development of electronic governance in any country is determined by cultural features, the level of education and information-communication infrastructure. The article comprehensively researches the readiness potential of Armenian and Russian societies for electronic governance. This choice is reasoned by the fact that, first of all, Russia and Armenia are members of the Eurasian Economic Union, which currently harmonizes digital transformation policies of the member-states. In this context the application of Hofstede’s model and Inglehart-Welzel’s cultural map allows to reveal that both Armenians and Russians are oriented towards struggle for survival at the expense of self-expression and strive to stability. The complex evaluation demonstrates low level for Power distance and Uncertainty. For Armenia it is 0.19 and for Russia - 0.06. This means that the level of technological conditions in a country does not necessarily lead to comprehensive technological penetration into a society. For instance, both Armenian and Russian societies have serious cultural barriers which impede the development of network interactions. The authors have calculated the readiness potential of the societies for electronic governance according to ICT access, ICT use, Government’s online service, E-participation, grand coefficient of the coverage of population with higher education, Power distance and Uncertainty avoidance for the above mentioned period. Their values are fluctuating in the range of 36.40–38.57% for Russia and 22.39–27.71% for Armenia. Thus the readiness potential of the societies for electronic governance has serious potential to develop in the future. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

It is shown that the modern stage of scientific and technological progress does not contradict Kondratiev’s concept of long cycles, but has its own characteristics. The hypothesis about the significance of the influence of universities on the formation of an upward wave of long cycles is confirmed on a long historical period. The current key aspects of changes in the interaction of higher education and the economy as a whole are analyzed taking into account dual problems: advanced training and delayed generalization by universities of actual transformations of the economy. The vision of the mission of the classical university (digital literacy in society) and the technical university (the formation of basic professional competences of modern engineer and researcher) is presented.

	abstract = {Digital economy brings new opportunities and threats to modern reality, covering almost all the fields of life of the population, including education. Digital economy opens up new strengths and weaknesses of a university. In this regard, a relevant task is to determine a set of goals for the development of the university and ensure movement towards these goals. The transition from the University 3.0 model to the University 4.0 model involves a comprehensive transformation of all processes in a university. Taking into account that the innovative educational and entrepreneurial activities played a leading role in the previous model, it is advisable, first of all, to ensure the digital transformation of these processes during the transition to the new model. An important factor in ensuring the competitiveness of a modern university is the digitalisation of its services. In the modern realities of the development of digital economy, universities are facing the need for digital transformation, the essence of which is based not only on the introduction of digital technologies in the activities of universities, but also on the cultural and organisational changes. The main features of the digitalisation process of the universities shall be: The university's orientation on the implementation of “smart manufacturing”; the use of digital communication technologies in the educational process; the introduction of network and distance learning; the development of basic information services; the creation and implementation of the “digital university management” service. Thus, digital transformation of the universities will make it possible for teachers, students, applicants and partners to provide more opportunities in the context of digitalisation. The transformation is impossible without the development and implementation of a digitalisation strategy that takes into account the features and specific nature of the university. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Lean is considered as a major management approach for improving operational productivity and organizational performance. It is a systemic philosophy that emphasizes on fulfilling customer needs, waste minimization, and a commitment to a culture of continual improvement. In recent years, many higher education institutions (HEIs) have leveraged on the use of technology to provide flexibility in learning and just-in-time training for learners in the efforts to improve both the internal processes of course delivery and enhance the provisions of education quality. In recognizing these trends in HEIs, the purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors that facilitate the conversion of printed learning resources to e-learning resources in a HEI. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative exploratory case study approach and examined a unique case of a HEI that is undergoing the transformation process from printed learning resources to digital sources to simplify the processes involved in educational service delivery and operational complexity. Data sources include semi-structured interviews with key personnel directly involved in the project of converting printed learning resources to digital sources, notes taken from informal discussions, and secondary data such as minutes of meetings, learning resource archives, and relevant literature. A retrospective perspective was adopted in the case analysis since the HEI has already completed 50 percent of the conversion phase when this study was carried out. Findings: Abductive reasoning approach and well-established lean principles were used to make sense of the digital transformation process of the HEI. Based on the retrospective case analysis, the authors found evidence that characterizes lean management principles and identifies the critical factors (CFs) that have facilitated the HEI to achieve the key milestones in the conversion journey. These include common vision, top management support and leadership, timely information sharing, and relationship management with key stakeholders in the transformation processes. Research limitations/implications: Since this research is an exploratory case study, the results obtained cannot be generalized. Future research can be conducted to provide an impact analysis of the potential risk factors of a system that employs only the use of e-study materials. In addition, future studies can also assess the quality of the learning services that is supported by the e-resources by gathering student feedback on their e-learning experience that is supported by the online digital learning resources and learning management system. Practical implications: This study provides managerial insights into the levers to engender the transformation from a traditional print learning resources model to leaning with digital e-learning resources. The insights into the CFs aid education managers to introduce process innovations and encourage behavioral changes that will benefit learners, instructors, and administers. Originality/value: The study is one of the first to apply lean management principles in making sense of the transformation processes involved in the use of digital innovation in higher education context. The findings provide a holistic view of the process transformations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The adoption of digital technologies demands people to develop adequate skills to capitalize on existing and future opportunities in the business and labor markets, respond to communities' needs, and help with sustainability issues. This work highlights that universities need to educate professionals with the skills to lead, manage and operate the digital change. This involves, developing in students the capacity to deliver high value contributions enriched with digital technologies to make a decisive impact on their disciplinary fields. Accordingly, Experiential Learning is referred as an effective pedagogical approach for Digital Transformation education because of the emphasis on innovation activities and active learning. An educational framework is presented to integrate different digital technologies, a structure of educational components, and strategic drivers for value delivery in organizations. The framework allows to conceptualize challenging learning experiences for Industrial Engineering education in terms of real-world digital transformation challenges to develop relevant learning outcomes. A method is also provided to conceptualize learning experiences in these terms. An instance of a learning experience is presented for the Lean Thinking Learning Space (LTLS) to exemplify the ideas of this work and provide a platform for further implementations. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of innovative technology, coupled with IT being a core function in contemporary business, there has been an upward trend of multi-national companies (MNCs) reporting a skill deficit in areas such as data analytics and cybersecurity (Columbus, 2017. IBM predicts demand for data scientists will soar 28% By 2020. Forbes; NeSmith, 2018. The cybersecurity gap is an industry crisis. Forbes). In a recent survey with over 3,000 CIOs, 65% indicated their organizations were unable to maintain par with the progression of technology in areas such as data analytics and security due to a lack of adequate talent (Harvey Nash & KPMG, 2018. CIO survey 2018). Although, organizations have recently started to expand their talent pipeline following a neurological breakthrough: research as well as anecdotal evidence suggests adults with mild forms of autism display above-average intelligence, increased attention focus, and high visual-spatial abilities; a combination in high market demand for roles such as software testing, data analysis, cybersecurity, and engineering due to their uncanny ability with pattern recognition, information processing, analytics, and attention to detail. These auspicious developments come at the helm of an increasing rate of governments around the world implementing provisions to their labour regulations towards equitable hiring of people with disabilities (Myors et al., 2017. Perspectives from 22 countries on the legal environment for selection. Handbook of Employee Selection. 659-677. Research Collection Lee Kong Chian School of Business.). Some, such as France, Japan, Kenya, Korea, and Taiwan, have gone so far as to set quota targets (Myors et al., 2017. Perspectives from 22 countries on the legal environment for selection. Handbook of Employee Selection. 659-677. Research Collection Lee Kong Chian School of Business.). The implication for organizations is that they need to develop disability-inclusive recruitment and selection systems along with work designs and environments that are disability friendly. But what does this mean in practice? What does a disability-inclusive recruitment and selection system look like? Enter DXC Technology (DXC): born out of a merger between global conglomerate Computer Science Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, generating close to 25 billion annually in revenue, with clients across more than 70 countries, they strategically became a pioneer in the digital transformation that was taking place globally. In the wake of the breakthrough in employment diversity, DXC recognized this as an opportunity to gain a critical edge within the increasingly competitive talent pool market. First, design a program of their own for recruiting and selecting adults with high functioning autism. Next, through a collaboration with various universities including the University of Queensland and Macquarie University, Neurodiversity Hubs were established; an initiative designed to assist neurodivergent students with obtaining work experience and internships. In doing so, they faced the following key challenges: How could they design a recruitment and selection strategy for neurodivergent individuals that was equitable, ethical, and efficient? In particular, where could they find suitable neurodivergent candidates, what criteria should they use to select them, and how should they handle unsuccessful candidates to ensure beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders?

	abstract = {We present conceptual foundations for artificial intelligence, expert systems, and knowledge engineering and management and discuss high quality in education. Following, we discuss the basics of our vision and prospective about higher education (HE): the battle for the future with digital transformation (DT). Next, we present our central Chapter 4 on DT: our dual model of knowledge and data, as befits a HE institution. Below, we present a succinct outline of our architectural model. The pillars of the architecture are funding, research, entrepreneurship and social projection (Chapter 8); recognizing from the start that knowledge has its ethos in the university; these pillars correspond to: • Productive ecosystem of the DT • DT that enhances knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capabilities • A new economy that requires the U transformation as social projection. • New DT human talent required by the new knowledge and intelligence industry. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required. Ten Views of Our DT Model, given its complex process that takes place in long ways, a process required for the successful survival of an organization into the IV Industrial Revolution, with the final purpose of being very competitive, productive and of high quality (HQ). The DT views, namely: 1- The DT Ecosystem. 2- The structural vision or the pillars of the DT mentioned. 3- The DT strategic map, showing scenarios, actors and vision-mission. 4- The architectural components for DT: 8 architectures were developed and implemented, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years at FESSANJOSE (U. San José), leading DT in postsecondary education (PSEd). 5- Digital 360° architecture of DT Academy and Administration LOCUS: this architecture is the digital portfolio that implies the organization of the subsystems to obtain better and/or new functionalities based on knowledge to obtain an intelligent behavior. The DT multilayer-architecture approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, which ensures compliance with government policies, norms and standards, in a highly complex social institution with digital assets; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is composed, and with the protocols by which the subsystems communicate. It provides a 360° business vision map and a planning framework for commercial and technological changes. 6- The computational-mathematical perspective of DT, identifying endogenous and exogenous variables and their interrelations. 7- The synthesis, the Matrix of End-Means (EMM) that summarizes in DT: Where the HE is. In addition, where can the HE go? 8- The MIR Matrix, which describes DT Objectives, impacts-indicators and results. 9- The dynamic model of the DT system, based on computational intelligence, representing the system information control of all the components to achieve the completion of the DT. The intelligent management information system (iMIS) for PSEd, shows the dynamics of DT, integrating several multilevel system hybrid architectures, as a space to respond to the solution of the HE problems, tending to the desired competitiveness, specifically pointing out the way that these modern technologies can be included for their adaptation and evolution in PSEd in post-modernity, making governability, and teaching and student productivity compatible with educational high quality, the purpose of DT. The interface Results of the iMIS includes: high quality metrics, digitization rate progress, indicators (an special appendix on KPI were included) and values of management, desertion, answers, and plans.

	abstract = {Cost pressure, competitiveness and the increasing turbulence of globalized saturated markets have been the driver for a variety of research activities in the field of production planning and control (PPC) during the past decades. For some time past an increasing awareness for introducing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the Internet to industrial production can be noticed. This trend is synonymously called 'Smart Production', 'Industry 4.0' or 'Internet of Things' (IoT). The key aspect aims to improve the basis for planning by optimising the data quality to ensure a mastery of the turbulent planning environment. So-called cyber physical systems (CPS) form the basis of this approach and allow an intelligent networking and interaction of products, machines, storage systems, production resources and human employees. Although there are many promising approaches, a solely implementation of innovative smart IT-solutions will not be sufficient to prepare a company's production for future changes. For a successful and effective realization of the IoT concept, important adaptions of existing organizational structures and processes are necessary. To accelerate the digital transformation, the requirements for a successful cooperation between human employees and technology within production planning and control need to be further analyzed and evaluated. This paper presents the key results of an extensive study that was conducted by the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (WZL) of the RWTH Aachen University to evaluate the current situation and examine the organizational readiness for the upcoming digital transformation. The study aims to show the need for action within different industries as a first step towards the digitized and networked production of the future. © 2019 Int. J. Mech. Eng. Rob. Res.},

The Russian industry has a significant gap from the industries of the developed countries, which raised the issue of the necessity the introduction of new technologies, new knowledge and the transformation of the traditional industry. The process of supporting the leading regional universities began in Russia with the aim of activating their interaction with the region’s industry. The article analyzes the socio-economic situation of the regions, in which flagship universities receive state support. The main objective of such universities is the university-industry cooperation in the sphere of new knowledge and technologies. The authors analyzed socio-economic factors that encouraged regional universities to participate in the flagship universities project competitive selection. The article examines the first eleven universities that have become flagship in this project. The authors presented a regional university –industry cooperation business model. The article focuses on two forms of such cooperation: direct cooperation and triangle cooperation (university-industry-state). The article shows that the flagship universities project has positive results of implementation during the first years of realization. More than 70% of the flagship universities became active partners with the regional industry and pushed the growth of the regional economy. Moreover, this article puts a start to a large research about the university-industry cooperation, especially in the engineering universities.

Findings show that digitalization as perceived by these universities features instrumentality (e-campus construction and application) and modernization (sustaining and efficiency innovations in teaching and learning), a situation also seen in other countries. On the other hand, there seems to be not enough incentive for them to use digital technologies to serve a wider community and to build technology-enhanced research capacity. There is also scanty evidence of open, flexible, distributed, and disaggregated learning encouraged in these plans. Finally, unique to Chinese higher education institutions are the goals of building a positive online ethos and developing political and ideological education via digital means.

At the macro level, correlation and regression statistical data analysis techniques are used to calculate the relationship between the basic indicators of economy digitalization and to reveal the key trends. Within the framework of K. Schwab's Industry 4.0 concept interpreting the interdependence of technological, social, cultural and political changes, the authors examine staff training in Russia's leading universities. In conclusion, the authors state that the curricula should be adjusted so as to include disciplines reflecting employers' demand for the digitalization of business processes. The article provides an analysis of a Yandex.taxi case through the prism of changing business processes and transformation of the value chain. The study describes the role of platforms, marketplaces and 'big data' in creating the network effect. The authors point to an evolutionary ("creeping") character of macro economy digitalization, social sphere in modern Russia and possible revolutionary ("galloping") changes in a separate market segment. Digital transformations of the business processes lead to considerable changes in the Five Forces model by M. Porter. Conventional concepts, such as demand, offer, clients, suppliers, competitors, borrow a number of important characteristics from each other creating a new market situation. The authors highlight that certain government efforts, budget policies and legal regulations are needed to tackle external negative effects of digitalization. © 2019 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM.

In 2015 Russian universities actively began to introduce digital technologies in the educational process, which was reflected in the development of online courses and the introduction of new disciplines. More than 3 years have been passed since the digital transformation of education has come. As part of the study, the authors identified and systematized the main factors of digitalization of higher educational institutions. Also, the authors analyzed the current level of digitalization of the leading universities in Russia. Evaluation of digitalization was carried out in the framework of the Program "5-100-2020". According to the results of the study, the growth points for the leading scientific and educational centers of the country were determined. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).},

	abstract = {Introduction. Transition to a post-industrial socio-economic structure and information society caused education crisis, which is common for world space. Dynamic development of high technologies and rapid obsolescence of knowledge significantly reduced life cycle of professions and caused deep structural changes in the sphere of employment. The need of economics for workers with qualitatively new qualification characteristics - a flexible person with meta-professional competencies, capable to solve complex professional problems and ready for innovative activity not just for today, but with the future in mind - has necessitated a significant updating of the system of vocational training and its reorgani-sation facilitating the implementation of a formula “lifelong learning”. The solution of problems of education begins with qualitative training of teachers, since the qualities of future professionals - graduates of the educational organisation, primarily depend on the level of teachers' competencies. The aim of the present article is to determine the strategic directions of innovative development of vocational education and preparation of highly qualified pedagogical personnel. Methodology and research methods. The hypothetico-inductive method, theoretic-methodological analysis and synthesis of the content of scientific literature were the major research methods. The research work was carried out on the basis of the principle of convergence, which determines cross-disciplinary and supra-professional communications, acts as a factor of design and a statement in professiology of a new phenomenon - transprofessionalism. The authors described the concept of transprofessionalism through the process- and project-based approaches. Results and scientific novelty. The developmental trends and directions of vocational education are considered. The principal defining factor of vocational education is close integration of all its processes and subsystems (prevocational training - secondary vocational education - higher education institutions - postgraduate training), which integrity is provided by the continuing and advanced education. The concept of transprofessionalism and convergence in multidisciplinary training of specialists is proved. The innovative educational programmes based on this concept are characterised. The logical-semantic model of a modern specialist is designed. This model can form an empirical basis to design vocational education platform, which integrates socio-humanistic, natural-science disciplines and related innovative technologies for teachers' training in the system of continuing vocational education. Strategic directions for realisation of such preparation are formulated: transprofessionalism, cooperation / collaboration, advanced and “high-speed” training, digital transformation. Practical significance. The research materials can be useful for specialists in the field of vocational education, heads of the educational organisations in order to develop and make managerial decisions and to effectively organise the process of vocational training of pedagogical personnel. © 2019 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution involves automation technology presenting new challenges to all sectors in the country that require them to make changes in line with the digital transformation to remain competitive. The higher education sector is one of the sectors most impressed with the development of this fourth industrial revolution. To achieve that goal, it requires a higher education institute that is more flexible and ready to face new challenges so that any class of society will not be left out in the globalisation and digital era. This paper will focus on exploring the impact of Higher Education (HE) 4.0 on the challenges, chances and opportunity in engineering education. The question is how does the institution, curriculum and readiness of the infrastructure adapt to the changes? What new skills are needed to deal with uncertainly and risk enhancing creativity in business thinking? Many articles are analysed and summarised to provide insight to the challenges, chances and opportunities of the Industrial revolution 4.0 in HE. Finally, this article will update the engineering education system status quo and prepare to implement and be a driving factor for the industrial revolution 4.0. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Health, such as the industry, university or city, is immersed in a process of digital transformation generated by the possibility and technological convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Artificial Intelligence on the one hand and their consequences on the other: Hyperconnectivity, datafication and algorithmization. This is a process of transformation towards what has come to be called Smart Health, Health 4.0 or mHealth. However, despite the enormous potential that underlies the digitization of the healthcare sector, this process can have very negative effects both for the sector and its organizations and for the system's user. One of the most worrying questions at this moment is the aspect and the force that bioethification is taking; that is, the process by which mass data on the opinions, preferences and behaviors of the hyperconnected users of the cyber-physical assistance system are stored, crossed and processed, on the basis of an utilitarian criterion, to determine through mathematical models what is morally valid.

	abstract = {Digital Transformation Inside Universities, a dual approach: On the way to the IV Industry Revolution companies of all kinds, are focused on the massive and optimal use of ICT in different organizational plans including human talent, organizational structures, processes, inputs, products, services and obviously the business model. Nowadays, 70% of the top companies have robust digital transformation (DT) teams, and 40% of them are being driven by high ICT and Artificial and Computational Intelligence. In other hand, very few Colombian universities have tackled the problem of competitiveness in higher education (HE), much less they have made the transition to the IV Industrial Revolution by taking the leap, thus receiving a tremendous blow due to academic obsolescence. In the recent ANDICOM (ICT International Congress, numerous national cases of domestic DT were presented from companies, but, unfortunately, not a single case of HE. Will the case of computerization in Colombia, be replicated, which was left to the discretion of transnational computer elites? The University DT implies necessarily the cognimatics (the informatics for the Knowledge Society) of all the companies, and their social insertion in this country. Why University Architecture: Enterprise Architecture (EA): Architecting implies the organization of subsystems or components to obtain better and/or new functionalities. If any component is knowledge-based, an intelligent behavior is obtained. The architecture-multilayer approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, that ensures compliance with government policies, rules and standards, in a highly complex social institution with intellectual assets and knowledge processes, which is a usual situation in a university institution; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is made-up, and with the protocols by which they communicate. EA and Business Architecture constitute a conceptual tool that helps the organizations to understand their own structure and the approach by which they work. It provides a business 360° vision map, and planning frame for business and technological changes. EA is presented like a system overall configuration of subsystems or components organized in layers, where each one describes an ordered congregation of structures and common functionalities grouped by a purposeful criterion inside the business. Our Proposal: We present a succinct outline of our architectural dual model (data-knowledge), of the digital university transformation. It is a dual DT model: curricular digitalization and institutional digitalization, i.e. knowledge and data. The pillars of the architecture are Funding, Research, Entrepreneurship and Social Projection, recognizing from the start, that Knowledge has its ethos in the University; they correspond to: 1-Productive Ecosystem of the transformation. 2-DT that enhance the knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capacities. 3-A new economy that requires transformation, also supported on entrepreneurship. 4-New DT human talent required by the new industry of knowledge and intelligence. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required. We discuss the basic, conceptual aspects, and methodology for the DT, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years leading the DT in Postsecondary Education (PSEd) © 2018 IEEE.},

At the same time, innovation literature has shown that accessing and integrating knowledge from sources that reside outside the firm, such as customers, competitors, universities, or consultants, is critical to firms' innovative success. In this paper, we draw on the knowledge-based view of the firm to investigate how search in external knowledge sources and information technology for knowledge absorption jointly influence process innovation performance. Our model is tested on a nine-year panel (2003-2011) of Swiss firms from a wide range of manufacturing industries. Using instrumental variables, and disaggregating by type of IT, we find that data access systems and network connectivity hold very different potential for the effective absorption of external knowledge, and the subsequent realized economic gains from process innovation. Against the backdrop of today's digital transformation, our findings demonstrate how firms should coordinate strategies for sourcing external knowledge with specific IT investments in order to improve their innovation performance.},

	abstract = {Personal brand is becoming extremely important in any field of human activity nowadays: Politics, show business, sports, business and science. On the one hand, the educational sphere of developing countries of the former Soviet Union is characterized by private conflicts, including the “teacher-student” field, the low prestige of the teacher’s profession because of the weak financing of this sphere and devaluing the teachers’ work during many years. On the other hand, the orientation of economies to innovative markets, the digital transformation of socio-economic systems necessitate the maintenance of strong, competitive education and science. This is impossible without top universities, high-class research centers, and therefore without unique teachers and researchers. An important task in this context is the formation of a new generation of highly qualified specialists, unique pedagogues and scientists, competitive in the world market. A special role here belongs to personal branding of such specialists. The purpose of this article is to study how a teacher’s personal brand can be built, what opportunities it opens, what are its value and specific features. In addition, the authors explore what factors contribute to the creation of a personal brand in the context of education and science. To solve these research tasks, the authors use methods of analysis, comparison and synthesis of information, survey methods (questioning, interviewing, narrative technique), modeling. One of the most significant results of the study is the model of the teacher’s personal brand developed by the authors, which shows what attributes of the image are of great importance for the personal brand of a teacher and scientist. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

These processes characterize the modern stage of development of the information society. There is a need to study the trends and prospects for effective use of mobile technology in various fields, including the use of mobile devices in the sociocultural and educational spheres. The authors consider the transformation of the educational model, which becomes relevant with the development of information and computer technology and develops by means of technology of mobile learning (m-Learning). Transformation processes that occur in education determine the prospects of m-Learning, which becomes the next stage of the development of electronic and blended-Learning technologies. The development of the information society leads to the further development of open education, and the role of information culture of the person increases. Analysis of the educational systems with respect to the use of mobile technology, a comparison of the dynamics and structure of promotion and development of e-technologies in education, their improving in Russia and abroad, the peculiarities of various types of learning technologies, identifying features of different information and computer technologies and their effective use, allow to trace the evolution and transformation of the processes. In these circumstances, mobile training is a promising step in the implementation of the concept of competence approach in education. Mobile education allows combining all the advantages of e-Learning technologies, providing new opportunities to students and teachers or tutors. However, it involves some risks, and their handling must be considered during the development of new educational programs. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

The purpose of the study was to develop and test indices of personnel support for the digitalization of the economy, as well as to identify socio-economic factors that significantly affect the level of personnel support for the digital transformation of the economy. Methodology: The study uses data from official statistical reports of the Russian Federation. The proposed staffing indices were modeled as target functions that depend on socio-economic factors that characterize the development of the economy in different dimensions. At the same time, the indices themselves were calculated as values that correlate the parameters of the output of digital specialists and their demand in the economy. Conclusion: The study compared statistical and neural network methods of data modeling and their generalizing indexes. The analysis of the obtained regression models and sensitivity analysis of trained neural networks allowed us to evaluate their accuracy in predicting trends in the digital economy staffing and to identify factors that significantly affect the achievement of the goal of matching the output of specialists and the requests of economic sectors. © 2020 Allied Business Academies.},

	abstract = {Given the speed of the changing landscape and the requirements In the article the problems of the modern global business landscape associated with the third wave of capitalism, digital transformation and discontinuity, the dominant role of the consumer in emerging markets, Hyper drive business, moving away from hierarchic decision-making and the transition to a market-oriented and seamless network structure, etc. are highlighted. Significant indicators of "Hierarchical changes Digital Economy Real Gross Output by Industry" determining the global economic profile of Digital Economy are revealed. In the article the necessity of transformation of the economic profile of Russia in the direction of sustainability that will allow the use of promising technological approaches for the conservation and sustainable dynamics of development are proved. This is fully in line with the process of fundamental changes to achieve maximum economic growth with the use of innovative technologies, implemented within the framework of the concept of the limits of the growth of The Club of Rome. As a rule, the processes of change can be either gradual through simple improvements or more radical - associated with structural changes. The application of radical changes is associated with the need to provide reliable, proven knowledge. Technological foresight should become less expensive, maintaining high quality. The natural candidate for this role are "Big Data", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain" - attributes of Digital Economy. The conducted analysis of the Russian digital economy profile, based on the assessment of changes in big data "Rank and Score" and ranking by "Indicator" and "Index", revealed the most sensitive elements of the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile. Big data "Global Innovation Index 2018" ("World international intellectual property organization") were used for the analysis. The cumulate analysis of big data changes "Rank and Score" and ranking by "Indicator" and "Index" allowed depicting the scheme of the the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile. Considering the dominant position of big data "Indicator" - "Innovation Output Sub-index", as well as "Strength" and "Weakness", the dominant factors that determine the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile were identified. Among the subsidizing factors the most risk-taking is Domestic "credit to private sector and market scale" and ICT "use and business model creation" were pointed out. The Russian resource-based economy is highly dependent on foreign capital and technology, especially at the stage of changing over from the fifth to the sixth wave of the Kondratiev wave. At the same time the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile highlights the essential role of Tertiary "education and enrolment". Most Russian firms urgently need addition to the stock human (intellectual) capital.

	abstract = {Purpose: Today’s generations face the effect that knowledge is no more usable for decades or even centuries. The pace of change as well as its profoundness has reached levels that cause massive changes in companies, but also whole societies. Some call this phenomenon the 4th industrial revolution or Industry 4.0. Others use the term “digital transformation”. Does this mean that quality managers are becoming obsolete soon? How do the Quality occupations adopt? Which changes need to be accomplished in the field of Quality occupations to provide sustainable competencies for future employees? What tasks and functions need to be carried out? And how can these tasks be defined on a universal basis that fits for different kind of branches as well as small and big companies? Design/methodology/approach: Based on Abbotts “System of Professions”, the development of a transformation concept for Quality occupations is carried out. The purpose of this paper is to define basic professional positions in the field of Quality Engineering regarding quality assurance (QA) and quality management (QM) as well as from an operative to a strategic level. Tasks and responsibilities of todays and future businesses models are clustered and enhanced or specified. In a survey, which included 389 executive managers in Germany, the German Association of Quality elevated those jurisdictions and their competences of QA and QM professionals. The results are used to define the new role bundle model for Quality occupations in Germany. Findings: The innovative and sustainable role bundle model offers defined Quality occupations for future business models needed for the 4th digital revolution. Thereby, not every role has to be taken by a separate employee in a business organisation. By offering different kind of clusters, the role bundle model helps to create agile role profiles regarding the actual business situation and its size. This way, tasks and jurisdictions within the business organisation can be adapted fast to the changes of the business organisation. Originality/value: The innovative concept is based on two success criteria: the creation of Quality occupations according to the changes of digital transformation and a survey involving more than 350 German executive managers in the field of Quality. Based on the results, a role bundle model for Quality occupations is designed that helps to coordinate education programmes at universities and professional trainings in Germany. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this context, it introduces the use of self-managed teams as a potential solution for companies seeking to benefit from the market disruptions imposed by the digital era. In this light, the paper provides an overview of the existing literature on both digital transformation and people management approaches as well as an outline of the research conducted. In order to draw an inclusive picture as part of the conducted desk study, high-profile and current research from publishers, scholars as well as professional associations were considered. The first part of the paper focuses on the definition and scope of digital transformation followed by a detailed outline of the impact on business operations and strategic considerations of companies to effectively manage the latest wave of digitally infused changes. In light of those disruptive changes faced by firms worldwide, the issue of people management deviating from the outdated command and control model has gained momentum. The significant development and recent trends in people management therefore forms the second part of this paper, which will be complemented by a presentation of the main drivers shaping the renewed role of self-managed teams in times of digital transformation.

Connecting several Master programmes in a cross-border virtual Master School is a straightforward approach for high-quality Master education-especially in domains with a high level of transdisciplinary, international cooperation (e.g. the KIC Master Schools [3], or the MSPME [4]). The EuroMPM uses the concept of the cross-border Master School to address some typical competence requirements for international project managers: intercultural teamwork & communication, interdisciplinary & international cooperation, diversity in topics and tailored approaches (driven by innovations, technology development and new business models, e.g. the digital transformation) and project complexity. The EuroMPM Master School goes beyond traditional exchange semesters. Important elements are block-oriented teaching in workshops with students and lecturers from partner universities, with industry involvement [5] and with an interdisciplinary teamwork. Exchange is fostered by a high number of interaction points between the programmes, e.g. summer schools and student conferences. Furthermore, the concept of the international classroom contributes to a unique learning experience. A virtual cross-border Master School on a European scale as the EuroMPM has the required international project culture already in its own DNA. EuroMPM conducts the research on the efficiency and effectivity of the competence delivery based on a tailored indicator framework. We will present the EuroMPM concept, excerpts of the indicator framework and examples of measurement results. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation has become a priority for any organization and Universities are not an exception. This paper deals with the digital transformation that is being undertaken at the University of Porto (U. Porto). In order to understand its major guidelines, it is important to clarify the term “digital transformation” and “digital business strategy”, comparing these new concepts with prevailing views of aligning the business strategy with the IT strategy. A newly created Shared Services Center (UPSSC) is at the core of the digital business strategy of U. Porto. This endeavor triggered a profound university wide re-engineering, that was enabled by a new work management system, hereafter referred to as UPWMS. The discussion of the distinctive characteristics of this work management system and how it copes with the diversity and heterogeneity of the requests received by the Shared Services, is the main objective of the paper. A discussion of the main cornerstones of the project in the context of the digital transformation strategy finishes the paper. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Today, the field of education around the world is facing a protracted crisis caused by the transition to post-industrial society. The dynamic knowledge obsolescence due to the rapid development of science and high technology caused deep structural changes in employment and significantly shortened the life cycle of professions. Modern economy needs specialists with qualitatively new characteristics: a competent and flexible person with meta-professional competencies, who is capable to implement innovative activity and to work in multitasking regime in the situation of instability and uncertainty, and who is ready for active professional self-determination throughout life. Therefore, a radical reorganisation of vocational education system is necessary to be undertaken. It is significantly important to solve this problem through the conduction of professional and pedagogical training of teachers, since the level of their competency primarily depends on the qualitative characteristics of future employees for diverse sectors of the economy and production. The aim of the present article is to define strategic guidelines for predicting the development of professional education in the conditions of post-industrial society. Methodology and research methods. The theoretical and methodological framework of the research is based on the theory of vocational development, the concept of determining the immediate and long-term perspectives of educational sphere, as well as logical-evolutionary, system-dynamic, project-based, personal and convergent approaches. In the course of the research, the methods of analysis, synthesis, generalisation and hypothetical-inductive method were applied. Results and scientific novelty. The trends and directions of vocational education development are identified and described. The principal defining factor of vocational education is close integration of all its processes and subsystems (prevocational, primary vocational, vocational higher secondary and postgraduate education), which integrity is ensured by the continuity and compliance with the principle of advanced education. The concept of convergence and transprofessi onal in multi-disciplinary training of professionals is revealed. The process of convergence, determining interdisciplinary and prevocational links, ensures transprofessionalism formation - human readiness and participation in the development and realisation of new types of socio-professional activities. A logical and semantic model of a modern specialist is constructed. This model can serve as an empirical basis for designing and supporting a vocational educational platform, which integrates natural science, industrial-technological and socio-humanitarian disciplines and related innovative technologies when training teachers for the system of vocational education. Transprofessionalism, cooperation, collaboration, advanced and high-speed education are highlighted as the vocational training strategies in the conditions of digital transformation of the economy. Practical significance. The research materials can be useful for the specialists in the field of vocational education, for the managerial staff of educational organisations when developing management decisions and organising efficient preparation of teaching personnel. © 2020 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

	abstract = {The study is carried out in response to the need to provide the economic digitalization of Russian regions with academic programs developed by national universities. In this regard, the paper is focused on researching into the reasons of the digital agenda disregarding higher education programs and their role in training the staff able to create new digital platforms and technologies, progressively introduce existing tools and decisions. The disclosure of the environment enabling to transform digitalization-based academic programs into an impetus of digital economy of a Russian subject, a driver to develop an innovative sector and a regional university network would address the shortage of highly qualified staff and help Russian regions catch up with the leading countries of digital transformation. The authors used a method of modelling to address the issues of providing regional economic digitalization with higher education programs within the framework of the unanimity of Russian and foreign scientific opinions and the world practice of territorial administration and sectoral governance. The paper presents theoretical and methodical basis for providing regional economic digitalization with higher education programs, provides an interpretation of triple-helix model as a method based on an innovative initiative and the equality of subjects in the chain ‘universities – businesses – governments’, reveals the direction of how to use the model in diversifying academic programs and distributing them spatially. The research has resulted in grounding the theoretical and methodical foundations of modelling as a method to providing regional economic digitalization and regional industries with higher education programs; a model well-balanced with regional and industrial strategies, university research activities; a strategy to implement the model in the economy of Russian regions. The study is scientific and practical value for researching into socio-economic development of Russian subjects and regional university networks, programming educational development. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Human potential is the main factor of modern economic growth. As before, human potential is the strong point of Russian innovation system but the risk of decline in its quality and of â€œbrain drainâ€ is high. In terms of share of population with higher education and quality of school education Russia is at the same level as the leading world countries. Quality of university education is getting better; Russian higher educational institutions are strengthening their positions in certain subject ratings. At the same time, negative short-term dynamics in the development of high-tech and science-based types of activity (amid internal growth) and negative long-term dynamics in the development of information industry have been observed. As digital transformation dramatically changes business practices, the success of digitalization is most dependent on one factor above all others. This crucial element is people: talented professionals who can use existing digital technologies and quickly adapt, using new methods and approaches. Without these people, it would be difficult for companies to fully realize the potential of the latest technological developments: Industry 4.0, robots, artificial intelligence, advanced data analysis methods, virtual reality and new digital business models. The digital transformation of a company can be successful only if there are people in the company who can competently carry it out. It is those people who can make technology work for the benefit of the company and create new business opportunities with the help of new ideas. These professionals will be the most sought-after and scarce in the job market. It is necessary not only to acquire new, outside talent to specific positions, but also to develop the digital skills of employees that are already working within the company. The most important thing to understand is how digital professionals think. The article analyzes the human resource component of business digitalization and explains the key questions that are connected to it: who is needed, how to attract competent personnel, how to raise the digital knowledge level of all employees. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).},

	abstract = {(a)Situation faced: INSUR is one of the top fifteen insurance companies in Germany. Between 2000 and 2015, the organization focused on (1) external growth through several acquisitions as well as (2) the integration of these acquisitions including the corresponding IT landscape into the overarching organization. From 2016 onwards, INSUR’s strategic focus shifted to actively shaping its group’s digital journey, including the build-up of new digital capabilities to fulfill the agility and innovation requirements of the business units. INSUR’s strategy focused on growth and efficiency gains through digitalization as well as on fostering innovation in developed digital solutions and services.(b)Action taken: At the end of 2015, INSUR’s top management started a strategic digital transformation initiative to define the cornerstones of the groups’ innovation and digital agenda. This agenda followed six strategic imperatives: (1) creating digital awareness throughout the organization; (2) developing a group-wide common understanding of digitalization and establishing the first digital and innovation strategy; (3) selecting and validating strategic focus areas for digitalization; (4) enlarging the company’s digital ecosystem using collaborations with startup accelerators and universities; (5) setting up a digital lab to develop and prototype digital use cases and (6) enhancing and scaling the digital lab towards a digital factory.(c)Results achieved: INSUR successfully initiated its digitalization journey and developed a high-level, group-wide digital and innovation strategy and selected its digital focus topics. Further, it set up an innovation management process and enlarged its digital ecosystem. The digital lab that INSUR started, however, did not take on as well as expected. Realizing that a small incubator is insufficient, INSUR is currently upscaling and transitioning the lab towards an integrated end-to-end digital factory.(d)Lessons learned: While all changes might require some management support, the nature of digitalization requires top management support across all business and functional areas right from the beginning. Even if there are still legacy systems that need to be shut down or renewed, digitalization should be addressed early on while continuing to renovate the IT. Furthermore, fostering cultural change to be an attractive employer for new digital talents, which are required on all levels to make the digital transformation a success, is a key success factor. Finally, handling and actively managing concerns and required cultural change within the organization are paramount. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The adoption rate of cloud computing technology in Indonesia is still low. In fact, Indonesia is still considered in the early stages of adopting (early adopter). One of the requirements for a successful digital transformation program can be seen in the cloud adoption rate. Already many industries, businesses and government institutions that adopt cloud technology, but higher education are not optimal in utilizing it. Higher Education known the potential benefits of using cloud computing. This allows higher education to avoid providing excessive Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and reduce maintenance costs. With the development of technology and services in cloud computing, higher education must be ready and courageous in utilizing this technology. The previous research mentions that the factors that determine the adoption of IT in higher education are the Impact and Benefits of IT Products for Higher Education, Infrastructure Availability, Intercultural Competition, IT Knowledge Academic Civitas, Civitas Academic Participation, IT Leadership, Technology Trend, and the existence of Blue Print IT. Another study related to e-readiness of Cloud Computing Service states that the factors that greatly affect the process of readiness of cloud computing adoption in higher education are the availability of IT Infrastructure and good IT Planning. The problem arises when the concept of e-readiness is combined with the adoption of information technology in this case cloud computing. This paper will present the results of the evaluation of the e-readiness cloud computing adoption service model at higher education. The research method used is Design Science Research Method (DSRM) from Peffers with statistical data processing using SPSS software tools. The result of data processing shows that the measurement of e-readiness adoption of cloud computing service model in higher education is influenced by the availability and competence of IT staff, Infrastructure Availability, and the existence of good IT planning. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As most developed countries are moving towards the trend of a digital, information economy, the role of a national ICT strategy and policy becomes an important point that can widely affect the result of such transformation. In recent years many growing or recovering economies have been fueled by ICT driven innovations provided by ICT professionals (Maryska et. al. 2010), which can only happen as long as there is a solid foundation for ICT investment, digital readiness, information technology education, support for research & development, as well as other aspects. (European Commission 2010, Oskrdal 2010, Pavlicek 2010). While most countries and their governing agencies are starting to be aware of the need to have a defined ICT strategy and measurement indicators, a number of them are still missing one, some don't have the necessary agencies with legal mandate to resolve issues of the digital age. At the same time, there are countries with a defined strategy, clear organization scheme and a long-term goal of supporting both economic competitiveness and well-being of all citizens. This paper aims to summarize and (when possible) compare various approaches to measure national ICT governance in select countries that have successfully started the digital transformation and either already are or are becoming the ICT economy hubs of the current world. The synthesized information should provide basic guidelines for ICT metrics. The paper follows up research conducted at University of Economics, Prague, defining ICT's economic and social impact. The main aim of this paper is to summarize answers to the questions mentioned earlier in ICT-successful regions and countries.},

	abstract = {Object of the study: The broad object of this study is the academic field of the book and the book as an area of interdisciplinary teaching. Purpose: to prove that the 21st-century cross-media and hybrid media ecosystem emancipates Book Science from the rest of the sciences in whose objects it can partake only as a constituent using one of its elements, properties or attributes. Tasks: to identify and summarise the theoretical and methodological differences between conventional Book Studies and the specific Book Science; to update and conceptualise the understanding of the book as a traditional means of communication in the light of the modern perspectives of digital transformation; to offer a framework of an innovative media science of the book. Hypothesis: Returning to the matter of the book as a medium, the hypothesis to be tested in this study is: "the book is set to be vindicated as a basic scientific category and be studied by a science of its own as an agent of communication, while the scientific book-as a communicator of "good" science. Methods: analytic and synthetic processing of primary and secondary resources, the selective monographic method, systematisation and summarisation of data from scientific-methodical and normative-legal documents on the issue examined. Results: Based on a working hypothesis, this study provides theoretical knowledge in Book Science and proposes points of support toward future fundamental and applied research in Book Science. Significance of the study: Overall, our findings suggest that 1) the research on the new theoretical views about the book will facilitate an increase in the academic interest in book-related professions, encourage the design and update of university curricula and programmes in Book Science, to support interdisciplinary research of book and digital media culture; 2) it is expected that the present text will provide the factors militating against the introduction of innovations in higher education and doctoral programmes in Book Science insofar as books as products of the publishing industry, and thus subject to market forces, drive back business interest in higher education toward book-related professions; appropriate measures to overcome the challenges outlined have been suggested. © 2019 by Academic Publishing House Researcher s.r.o.},
