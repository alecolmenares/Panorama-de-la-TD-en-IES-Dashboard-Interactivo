abstract = {This paper examines the connections and influences of the job market in a Brazilian higher education setting. Adopting a qualitative approach and a technical case study procedure, open and semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed through the discursive textual analysis technique. From the words of the Dean and the Chair of a business management program in a Brazilian higher education institution and the employers of some of its graduates, the authors note that the education delivered is directly influenced and fueled by actual problems and settings in the labor market. Nonetheless, the same market that welcomes these new professionals does not realize its influence and still requires certain behavioral and interpersonal skills from them.}

However, companies may fail to extract value from digital transformation due to the disconnection between strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Through the analysis of three case studies of firms that digitally transformed their business—namely ABB, CNH Industrial, and Vodafone—this article presents a framework than can help companies implement their digital transformation strategy and thereby renovate their business model.}

abstract = {Companies and governments have embraced digital transformation as the elixir of the 21st century. But what impedes digital transformation? This case study article is based on data gathered from field research with the Italian Parliament and the Digital Transformation High Commissioner’s Office in the Ministry of the Interior. The case surfaces the context, challenges, and solutions for large-scale public administration digital transformation. The case study highlights how public administration digital transformation in a large democracy is never a technical but a sociotechnical solution. Successful digital transformation needs to understand, address, and change sociopolitical and sociotechnical mores that often define the culture. Underscoring this research is an analysis of digital transformation within the Italian public administration. Public administration encompasses all governmental and public services, including services provided by federal, regional (e.g. states and provinces), municipalities, and local agencies. The Italian public administration, with 60 million people, 8000 municipalities, and 22,000 local administrations, highlights how a digital renaissance is a preface for innovative disruption challenges. The Digital Transformation case uses Italy as the backdrop and Team Digitale, a team of talented individuals embarked on building public administration efficiencies and rebooting Italy’s digital innovation footprint, as the protagonist. For granularity, the case focuses on two digital transformation projects: ANPR, a unified public registry for all Italian residents, and PagoPA, a universal digital payment platform for public administration. This case surfaces the best practices and challenges faced when trying to tackle a mega-project across an entire economy. The case offers digital transformation recommendations, generalizable across any global democracy. The case analysis and recommendations bring to light how, contrary to private organizations, institutionalizing a disruptive innovation in a democratic country at a time of fiscal austerity highlights interesting decision-making issues and facets.}

abstract = {Developing human resources and matching job profiles are essential tasks to promote economic and social growth. The technology-related job market has undergone significant changes over recent years, mainly due to technological advances that have pushed industry toward new demands for skilled professionals. This change in required skills and competencies has led to a gap between what companies need and the professional profiles that are available in the job market. Technology companies are often unable to find an employee who meets the required profile, resulting in financial loss and extra training expenses. It is therefore essential that higher education in technology is reconsidered to address job market demands. Thus the goal of this work is to evaluate the relationship between the professional profile required by information technology (IT) companies and what students are taught on IT-related programs in higher education institutions (HEIs). The authors adopt a systemic perspective in three different qualitative approaches. They cross-check and link data on educational curricula acquired from interviews with IT human resource managers (HRMs) and student focus groups. The analysis reveals that HEIs must go beyond the transfer of knowledge and technical qualification in IT, promoting a comprehensive education that incorporates personal development goals, with a focus on developing social and emotional skills. The study focuses on the emerging economy of Brazil and presents findings from which other developing countries can learn. The results reveal the critical role of soft skills in the professional development and employability of students and the associated challenge for technical education. In conclusion, the authors also highlight the importance of partnerships between HEIs and HRMs as a fundamental strategy to fulfill the current skills gap.}

Our research aims to develop a systematic literature review, in which we will study the relationship between entrepreneurial ecosystems and digital transformation, at the micro, meso and macro levels. For this, we used the Web of Science to collect our database, and we analysed 73 articles that were included in our study for their purpose. In our analysis, we were able to identify the characteristics of the environments of entrepreneurial ecosystems, the actions of digital technology approaches to digital transformation and the necessary skills in the scenario of entrepreneurship. Thus, we proposed a conceptual model with the presentation of the relationship between entrepreneurial ecosystems and digital transformation, which may be useful in future studies. The greatest contribution of our investigation is the offer of this systematization to this field of study, allowing us to see the different paths of investigation.}

abstract = {The increasing digitalization of economies has highlighted the importance of digital transformation and how it can help businesses stay competitive in the market. However, disruptive changes not only occur at the company level; they also have environmental, societal, and institutional implications. This is the reason why during the past two decades the research on digital transformation has received growing attention, with a wide range of topics investigated in the literature. The following aims to provide insight regarding the current state of the literature on digital transformation (DT) by conducting a systematic literature review. An analysis of co-occurrence using the software VOSviewer was conducted to graphically visualize the literature’s node network. Approached this way, the systematic literature review displays major research avenues of digital transformation that consider technology as the main driver of these changes. This paper qualitatively classifies the literature on digital business transformation into three different clusters based on technological, business, and societal impacts. Several research gaps identified in the literature on DT are proposed as futures lines of research which could provide useful insights to the government and private sectors in order to adapt to the disruptive changes found in business as a result of this phenomenon, as well as to reduce its negative impacts on society and the environment.}

abstract = {The digital transformation has a profound implication for entrepreneurial innovation. In contrast, scholarly attention is mainly towards entre­preneurial innovation in pure digital businesses at the organisational and individual levels. However, our understanding of its implication at a higher level of aggregation, like the regional and national levels, is limited. Drawing on the national systems of innovation, I conceptualise digital transformation as changes in digital institutional and digitally relevant individual factors and examine its implication for digital business model innovation and entrepreneurial innovation at the country level. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis for a sample of 55 countries, I explore the causal configurations explaining the implication of digital transformation. The result indicates that digital transformation fuels digital business model innovation in specific and entrepreneurial innovation in general at the country level. This study contributes to understanding the broader implication of digital transformation and extends the boundary condition of the national systems of innovation in the digital context.}

abstract = {Digital transformation has been inevitable in all socio-economic fields, including higher education. Recently, under the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have to change their entire teaching systems to online learning to ensure their students’ learning is not interrupted. Thus, it is essential to study how universities’ students, educators, and administrators perceive online learning in different countries. To this aim, this study investigates the factors affecting university members’ preference for online learning in Singapore and Vietnam. Using a cross-country sample with a sound theoretical framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we found that each member group in the university was influenced by a different weight of factors. Specifically, students’ preference for online learning is most affected by their technical skills. Meanwhile, educators and administrators are influenced mainly by the perceived usefulness of online learning and practice conditions, respectively. We further conducted multi-group testing and confirmed the certain separation in online learning preferences of observed objects between the two countries. Overall, this paper enriches the literature on online education, and has important implications for educational policymakers and university stakeholders both during and after the pandemic.}

However, there is often confusion regarding what steps organisations should follow to achieve digital transformation, including to benefit innovation processes. In this study, we outline seven steps in a conceptual model – the digital transformation loop – which organisations can adopt for what we call “agile digital transformation”. We use the UK health care sector as a case example, which is central to social and economic infrastructures, yet faces continued innovation challenges. Our aim is to offer a compelling and accessible conceptualisation that illustrates challenges faced by the health care sector and poses questions that all organisations need to reflect upon to realise innovation benefits that arise from the agile adoption of digital technology. We argue that agile digital transformation must be part of achieving a clear strategic vision and should drive sustained and demonstrable business value.}

The impact of “Digital Transformation and Innovation”; “Digital Transformation and Adversity”; and “Digital Transformation and Technological Issues” has been assessed on “Workplace Well-being” and “Adversity and Psychological Well-being”. Six hundred and seventy-seven responses, 375 from India and 302 from Mexico, have been received and used for data analysis. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been used to define exogenous and endogenous constructs. The Multigroup Analysis (MGA) tool of PLS-SEM was implemented to compare the results from both nations. The MGA results explain the significant difference for the impact of “Digital Transformation and Adversity (DTA)” on academicians’ “Workplace Well-being (WW)” and “Adversity and Psychological Well-being (APW)”.}

Indeed, the most common descriptions of family businesses convey the idea that they favour stability to change and slow evolutions to upheavals and disruptions. This article attempts to answer the question: How could family businesses embrace the values and overcome the hindrances to digital entrepreneurship? To this end, this article suggests a conceptual model of digital entrepreneurship adoption in family firms. Based on the socioemotional wealth logic, we first describe the main variables influencing digital entrepreneurship adoption and then analyse the moderating influence of family involvement in the firm on the relationships between these variables and digital entrepreneurship adoption.

abstract = {This paper aims to diagnose the information culture of the university administration. Although university administrative work is commonly associated with bureaucracy, it is a bureaucracy of people in which employees demonstrate a set of competitive group information behavior focused on knowledge sharing and information use in day-to-day tasks. A group of 345 respondents, representing office staff from three institutions in Poland, answered the survey related to information culture. The research framework included 16 information behaviors, grouped by four levels of information and knowledge management and four types of information culture. The results were examined using statistical packages to perform the Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and ordinal/linear regression analysis. Professional Bureaucracy culture is the dominant characteristic of the information behavior of university administrations, but its functioning is supported by three parallel information cultures included in the research model. The main limitation of the study is that it covers only lower-level employees’ information practices. The applied scale, based on professional stratification within the university administration, is highly sensitive regarding different institutional contexts covered in the information culture diagnosis. To support the development of Professional Bureaucracy, it is necessary to support internal openness of behavior (socialization), internalization of knowledge, and external networking.}

The current pandemic crisis has accelerated the need to diagnose and understand more systematically Higher Education students’ digital competences and the way in which they shape academic performance and outcomes. This empirical study explores the digital competences of students, studying in Law related courses, by means of a self-assessment survey tool, which has been previously tested with information and library science students, and was developed to study students’ technology mastery (i.e. the abilities, competences, capabilities and skills required for using digital technology, media and tools) and their digital citizenship mindsets (consisting of attitudes and behaviours necessary to develop as a critical, reflective and lifelong learners). The study found age demographic differences, which presented significant correlations pointing to the presence of diverse levels of competences in the student group. Correlation statistics of the survey data demonstrated that students’ prior everyday participation as a digital citizen was connected to a number of important academic skills, such as the ability to identify information in different contexts, students’ digital learning and development, their digital abilities to complete academic work, their information literacy skills and their skills around managing their digital wellbeing and identity. Focus groups data with academics revealed that they valued the development of students’ digital competences for the purposes of learning, while studying at university and placed less emphasis on digital citizenship skills. These academics also considered the value of digital platforms and tools (the focus on “ICT Proficiency”) to be more relevant for academic study than digital citizenship mindsets.}

abstract = {Despite its enhanced legislative powers, the European Parliament still struggles to be recognised as an authoritative and reliable political actor. Its current role in EU digital governance serves as a good example to illustrate both the aspirations of the parliamentarians as well as their actual impact. Confronted with a horizontal policy issue that affects all sectors of the analogue and digital world parliamentary working methods have proven to be unfit for purpose. The European Parliament has so far been unable to assume leadership to guide the EU through the digital transformation process. Yet, its aspirations are not pulled out of thin air. Intellectual freedom, swift decision-making channels, and an open and pragmatic debating culture make it, in fact, predestined to define an overarching and balanced digital agenda for the EU. Before this is achievable, however, it is necessary to execute comprehensive internal reforms to overcome a list of structural, financial, political and external deficits.}

This increased reliance on big data in medicine can lead to shifts in the norms that guide healthcare providers and patients. Continuous critical normative reflection is called for to track such potential changes. This article presents the results of an interview-based study with 20 German and Swiss experts from the fields of medicine, life science research, informatics and humanities of digitalisation. The aim of the study was to explore expert opinions regarding current challenges and opportunities related to data-driven medicine and medical research and to provide a methodological framework for empirically grounded, continuous normative reflection. To this end, we developed a heuristic tool to map and structure empirical findings for normative analysis. Using this tool, our interview material points to a polarisation between individualistic and collectivistic orientated argumentations among experts. The study shows that a multilevel analysis is required to deal with complex normative implications of data-driven approaches in medical research and healthcare.}

Given the changing dynamic work environment, the present study which is exploratory in nature attempts to understand the expectations, attitudes, and priorities of millennials from their future workplace. Specifically, this study focuses on millennials who are undergoing their education and will be entering the workforce. A combination of random sampling and convenience sampling was used to arrive at a sample size of 140. While millennials are technologically proficient, their expectations go beyond being technically superior. The findings from this research clearly suggest that millennials are looking for strong mentors both in their education and work environment and want a road map to help them grow. Reward and recognition of their ideas is very important and more than online course and e-learning modules, gaining exposure by working in cross-functional teams and with subject matters is important. Organizations should keep in mind the expectations and needs of this diverse group, which would help them while strategizing their recruitment, onboarding, and retention policies.}

Data and text mining analysis provides additional insights into online hotel ratings. The authors confirm that online travelers’ evaluations are multifaceted constructs displaying varying patterns of rating behavior among the traveler base. By investigating the contemporary relevance of geographic and psychic distance, a key finding of this study is that travelers with less distance both in terms of psychic and geographic distance give a lower rating score than travelers with greater distance. The inclusion of psychic and geographic distance is advocated as a salient aspect for future researchers and for those practitioners who wish to enhance hotel product and service features.}

The use of digital media often confines the design process to only the digital realm; in this class, students moved fluidly back and forth from digital to physical using digital tools in unorthodox ways. These different media transformed the design process from a tangible portrayal of architectural design to a virtual portrayal, and vice versa. With this interchanging and crossing over of design environments from reality to virtuality the limits of each one are dismantled, both realms can be brought together in an overall process that led to alternative form findings and resulting designs.

The International Labour Organization (ILO), since 2015 and in the context of its Future of Work Initiative, aimed to position itself in the discussion by putting this issue at the centre of their activities for its centenary (2019). The normative and conceptual approach developed by the ILO in this initiative was named the “human-centred agenda”, aimed to align technological change with decent work and social justice. Although preliminary scholarly works have seen these efforts as a humanistic and pro-worker “countermovement”, a deeper analysis of the ideas and interests involved in the Future of Work Initiative reveals a different, more complex picture. This article studies the creation of the human-centred agenda led by the ILO secretariat and the Global Commission on the Future of Work, and how it was further negotiated and modified by the social partners in the making of the Centenary Declaration in 2019. In particular, it shows how business at the ILO and right-wing populist governments, in tandem, reoriented the human-centred agenda towards a pro-employer perspective, thus framing social and labour policy as a tool for adapting the workforce to technological change. It concludes with some reflections about the consequences of these developments for the ILO’s position in global governance.}

abstract = {The financial sector in China is well known as a government-dominated hierarchy, and the access to financial services has been controlled primarily by the state-run banks. Fin-tech businesses, or so-called “Internet finance,” in China have included new actors such as Internet companies, small and medium enterprises, and small lay investors in the financial regime. The new entrants’ technology-mediated interactions with the government engendered new politico-economic relations within and beyond the market, in the cyberspace and in everyday life. How have the Chinese modes of financial inclusion reconfigured the power relations between the state, corporations, and the investing public in China? Through the political-economic analyses of three specific forms of fin-tech businesses—third-party payment, peer-to-peer lending, and money market fund this article argues that Chinese fin-techs have enabled a broader societal participation to investment practices and empowered Internet corporations alongside the state-controlled financial systems. Thus, such an inclusion is less about the “inclusive finance” endorsed by the World Bank for the under-represented social groups’ accesses to financial services. It is more of a technology-facilitated financialization initiated by the state, promoted by information technology companies, and popularized among small investors. Rather than leading to the decentralization of financial power, China’s fin-tech has formed a higher level of concentration of financial capital controlled by the Chinese oligopoly Internet corporations. Moreover, the collaborations and competitions between the growing fin-tech companies and the state-owned financial sector deserve further observations.}

abstract = {The globalization of commercial exchanges and capital movements reveal new ways of obtaining value in economic activities, and the differences in the tax burden of companies, depending on where they reside, have become threats for countries to exercise the right to tax business profits generated in its jurisdiction. This problem, together with tax competition between countries, causes a transfer of tax bases towards countries with lower tax rates and tax havens. The lack of agreement in the international community on how to find a solution to the problems has caused several countries to choose to establish special taxes for certain activities of multinational companies in their jurisdictions, resulting in inefficient taxes. This paper analyzes the agreement reached in October 2021 in the G20 and in the OECD in which measures are adopted within the BEPS project to prevent the erosion of tax bases in market jurisdictions promoted by multinational companies. After studying different aspects, we found fundamental reasons for not having an optimistic view on the effective solution to the problems above: unrealistic forecasts on the amount of the new estimated tax bases for Pillar 1 and the high administration and compliance costs. In conclusion, it is not foreseeable that the tax bases derived from the provision of digital services will suffer a territorial redistribution. We do not expect that a minimum tax rate of 15% in corporate tax will be carried out effectively or that the benefits that are transferred to tax havens will be significantly reduced.}

This study presents a cross-country analysis of the emergence of national electronic identification (e-ID) solutions as the result of interaction between the financial and the public sector in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Drawing on on-line sources, documents, and interviews with key actors in the three cases, we adopt a cross-disciplinary perspective by applying the lens of collective action theory to identify the role of interests, resources, and governance in the emergence of national e-ID solutions. Findings show that different governance solutions can emerge as the result of the convergence of interests and of interdependency of resources between the actors over time. We contribute to research on financialization and IT by proposing a dialectic process model and identifying five mechanisms that drive the process forward.}

However, given the frequency of change and volatility experienced in organizations, it is far more likely that individuals, work groups, and organizations will sporadically experience misfit with various aspects of the environment. This recognition has led to steady growth in misfit research, but this literature lacks conceptual clarity, provides differing views on the interplay between fit and misfit, and as a result, insights on the consequences of misfit are fragmented. To address these shortcomings, we conducted a systematic review of the misfit literature and analyzed 106 scholarly articles published between 1981 and 2021. Our review offers three key contributions. First, we identify four distinct conceptualizations of misfit from the literature and then offer an integrative definition of misfit. Second, we provide a multi-level synthesis of the antecedents and outcomes of misfit that highlights the need for more cross-level and multi-level research. Third, we lay out a rich and detailed agenda of future research to further enhance our knowledge of misfit as a concept distinct from its P-E fit roots.}

Direct risks are AI-induced forms of discrimination, surveillance and information asymmetries at work. Indirect risks are enhanced workplace automation and the increasing “fissurisation” of work. Direct and indirect risks are illustrated using the example of the transport and logistics sector. We discuss policy responses to both types of risk in the context of the German economy and argue that the policy solutions need to differ according to the type of risk. Direct risks can be addressed by European and national regulation against discrimination, surveillance and information asymmetries. As for indirect risks, the first step is to monitor the risks so as to gain an understanding of sector-specific transformations and establish relevant expertise and competence. This way of addressing AI-induced risks at work will help to improve the prospects of decent work, fair remuneration and adequate social protection for all.}

In the context of digitization, I argue, social research becomes noticeably a distributed accomplishment: online platforms, users, devices and informational practices actively contribute to the performance of digital social research. This also applies more specifically to social research methods, and this paper explores the phenomenon in relation to two specific digital methods, online network and textual analysis, arguing that sociological research stands much to gain from engaging with their distribution, both normatively and analytically speaking. I distinguish four predominant views on the redistribution of digital social methods: methods-as-usual, big methods, virtual methods and digital methods. Taking up this last notion, I propose that a redistributive understanding of social research opens up a new approach to the re-mediation of social methods in digital environments. I develop this argument through a discussion of two particular online research platforms: the Issue Crawler, a web-based platform for hyperlink analysis, and the Co-Word Machine, an online tool of textual analysis currently under development. Both these tools re-mediate existing social methods, and both, I argue, involve the attempt to render specific methodology critiques effective in the online realm, namely critiques of the authority effects implicit in citation analysis. As such, these methods offer ways for social research to intervene critically in digital social research, and more specifically, to endorse and actively pursue the redistribution of social methods online.}

Four concerns emerge as relevant: Integrity of recommendations provided by decision-support systems, including how they are influenced by local organisational practices and the reliability of underlying infrastructures; Inclusive decision-making that balances the (assumed) objectivity of data-driven algorithms and the influence of different stakeholder groups; Exception and accountability in how digital and AI platforms are funded, developed, implemented and used; and an expectation of Complete understanding of people and events through the integration of traditionally dispersed data sources and systems, and how policy actors seek to mitigate the risks associated with this aspiration.}

This paper intends to forecast and understand the impact of the new trends on general public through qualitative research deployed with experts from different European countries. It aims at clarifying the predisposition to adapt daily habits to adopt autonomous and connected vehicles, electrical motorizations and servitization. Those areas of deployment in the mobility industry represent relevant dilemmas in terms of social exchange. Businesses, technical and physical infrastructures, public services and regulations are among those areas highly affected by this evolution. Despite the reported advantages of those trends, those innovations will only be supported by specific groups of population and policy-makers unless they show similar benefits to traditional mobility means.

abstract = {Classic agenda setting and news framing research focuses on traditional media actors: journalists, political figures, professional communicators. However, the personalization of politics and journalism, as well as the rise of social media, is creating new spaces for other actors, like comedians. In the separation of vertical media (media which are still aiming for a wide audience with content of general relevance) and horizontal media (more specific media actors building a community around the content they produce), comedians can be considered actors in horizontal media, who help provide the community agenda. This study compares how comedians in horizontal media frame news and current affairs with how journalists in vertical media frame similar news. The study is performed via a quantitative content analysis of Swedish political comedy and traditional Swedish news coverage, with a focus on the emerging podcast medium. It shows that the comedic framing is dramatically more personal and emotional. It is also more thematic and more often on a societal level, while the journalistic news framing is more episodic and on an individual level. The comedic framing is also more focused on issues of political figures and processes, more negative, and more inclusive of different types of societal actors when compared to the news reporting of vertical media.}

abstract = {In its history, production, plots and gestures, slapstick comedy was tied to the rise of modern labor in terms of both Taylorist theory and Fordist practice. Comic heroes ranging from live action comedians Chaplin or Keaton to animated animals Felix or Mickey worked against work through the playful excesses of their obediences and transgressions within an increasingly rationalized, industrial world. The digital animation studio Pixar summoned slapstick and its specifically Fordist resonances in its 2008 feature, WALL-E, yet offered a twist in humanizing a figure of perfected Fordism itself with its title character, a robot repetitively working in a post-apocalyptic earth devoid of human life. Explicitly modeled after Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, WALL-E contrasts with the film’s humans, who are entirely liberated from labor through automation in a satirical reflection of both post-Fordist accounts of the “end of work” as well as broader critiques of a distracting digital culture. This article focuses on the film’s revitalization of slapstick traditions within the context of recent debates about post-Fordism, the future of automated labor and the transformation of working human bodies. Just as slapstick’s relationship to modern labor touched on the playful mode of its cinematic production as well as their form as indexical montage so too does Pixar’s corporate reputation as “Creativity, Inc” suggest a complex relationship between its slapstick hero and the digital labor animating his movement. The same will be argued of Pixar’s vaunted techniques with both digital image-making and commodity generation, both of which suggest a nostalgic animation of slapstick’s antinomies as much as a disavowal of the post-Fordist production of which Pixar is vanguard.}

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer science can be used by social scientists in their study of groups and teams. Here, we explain how developments in machine learning and simulations with artificially intelligent agents can help group and team scholars to overcome two major problems they face when studying group dynamics. First, because empirical research on groups relies on manual coding, it is hard to study groups in large numbers (the scaling problem). Second, conventional statistical methods in behavioral science often fail to capture the nonlinear interaction dynamics occurring in small groups (the dynamics problem). Machine learning helps to address the scaling problem, as massive computing power can be harnessed to multiply manual codings of group interactions. Computer simulations with artificially intelligent agents help to address the dynamics problem by implementing social psychological theory in data-generating algorithms that allow for sophisticated statements and tests of theory. We describe an ongoing research project aimed at computational analysis of virtual software development teams.}

These images are obtained from Feulgen-stained nuclei in semithin sections. Data are extracted by a scanning microphotometer, printed on paper tape and processed by an electronic computer. The essential principles for the selection of descriptors were that: (a) they should correspond to characteristics that are employed in classical morphology and (b) they should be subject to interpretation in categories of biochemistry or molecular biology insofar as possible. Some of these parameters deal with the size and shape of the nucleus and its deoxyribonucleic acid content or staining behavior. Efforts were made to determine the relative amount of chromatin in the condensed state, because it may be assumed that the degree of condensation correlates with the activity of the chromatin. To demonstrate the power of the method, results from methylthiouracil-activated thyroid nuclei are presented. In stimulated nuclei the diffuse chromatin expands and fills the increasing nuclear volume, while the condensed chromatin retains its degree of condensation, and, probably, does not change in amount.}

Regression models on cross-sectional survey data from Eurobarometer surveys covering ten waves between 2015 and 2019 supplemented by a series of macro-level covariates establish that residents in regions with higher shares of high-growth enterprises are more likely to view globalization as an opportunity. More importantly, the positive association between regional high-growth enterprise shares and support for globalization is particularly pronounced among lower-educated and lower-skilled individuals.}

abstract = {Clothing matching refers to the coordination of style, color, etc. to achieve a decent and generous effect. With the development of artificial intelligence, increasing research efforts have been dedicated to complementary garment collocation as matching clothes to make a suitable outfit has become a daily headache for many people. However, existing studies neglect rules regarding clothing matching, which are based on the knowledge accumulated in the fashion domain and are implicitly transmitted and ambiguous. Towards this end, this article proposes an expert system based on domain knowledge implemented using the Prolog program to realize rule-guided clothing collocation. The article constructs clothing matching rules from four essential clothing attributes: season, type, style, and color, and uses Prolog syntax for knowledge representation. For the formulated facts and rules, the reasoning machine iteratively matches the user’s instructions with the system knowledge to reason out suitable matching suggestions. In this study we built a website as a man-machine interface to facilitate friendly interaction and set season, type, style, and color sub-options to match clothing and satisfy user preferences. The system validation based on standard metrics (precision, recall, F1-measure) achieves results above 81%. The main contribution is that the system could match clothes more accurately according to the likes and requirements of users. After comparing with other research, the system is expected to provide suggestions or references for people to choose style and dressing.}

This research sought to understand how PA practitioners and educators perceive their role as applied PA practitioners. Twenty-seven applied PAs and educators with applied PA experience participated in six online focus groups, completing an online survey in advance. Reflexive thematic analysis of transcripts and survey data generated an overarching theme: embedded applied PA practitioners have a value co-creation role within performance ecosystems which is inhibited by poor professional infrastructure and a lack conceptual clarity for the role. Five sub-themes are reported; the (a) why, (b) what, and (c) how of professional practice; d) the impact of stakeholder misunderstanding on PA practitioners; and (e) issues with professional recognition, development, and renumeration opportunities. This study demonstrates applied PAs’ role as curators, translators, influencers, and educators aiming to add value to the decision-making of a wide range of stakeholders. It highlights a potential deficit in applied practice in “value capture” which may be perpetuating the problems practitioners reported with stakeholder misconceptions and undervaluing of their role. It is hoped this paper will inspire those invested in applied PA practice to create a shared understanding of how they can add value within the performance ecosystem so the profession can evolve and thrive.}

At the same time, since China joined the Word Trade Organization in 2001, art, culture and media production have been largely transformed from vehicles for state propaganda into new gateways for producing and showcasing popular commercial entertainment. Korean producers have played a significant role in this evolving transformation, albeit in a cultural space that the Government of Mainland China still uses and shapes as an important mouthpiece of the Party-state. While media headlines accentuate these progressive pathways, there is a dearth of scholarly commentary on the ways in which Korean film practitioners are contributing to this new era of cultural globalisation in China. To shed light on this emerging topic, the authors examine Chinese audiences’ reception of the Korean film Miss Granny (2014) and the most successful Korean–Chinese co-production to date, its Chinese remake 20 Once Again (2015). The article utilises data drawn from Douban, a major Chinese entertainment and popular culture social networking site, to assess the “inconspicuous” impact of the cinematic component of the Korean Wave on Chinese cinema. In taking this approach, the authors seek to assess the importance of localized film content for Chinese audiences, as well as canvassing a range of hitherto unknown opinions about “Korean” and “Chinese” styles of storytelling.}

The article shows what digitalisation and “platformisation” do to the possibility of (local) state regulation of housing informality and illegality in the European context. As platforms have been reluctant to release individualised STR listings to local authorities, the latter have had to rely on imperfect, “DIY” methods of data gathering in the physical and digital worlds, in the context of attempts to regulate STR for public interest objectives such as the protection of the long-term residential stock.}

The study has been conducted based on qualitative method of social science research. The primary evidence for this study has been collected through semi-structured in-depth personal interviews with key resource persons in international trade. The study finds that rising competition in global apparel trade largely influences Bangladesh’s competitiveness in the apparel industry compared to China. However, China’s apparel industry faces challenges from rising production costs. It also finds that unrestricted trade flows among Asian competitors through bilateral and comprehensive trade agreements have severe implications on Bangladesh’s competitiveness in apparel sector, while trade protectionism remains the key barrier towards China’s share of exports in global apparel market. The findings of the study will be crucial for both Chinese and Bangladeshi policy makers and stakeholders to address existing impediments, including future challenges to gain a competitive advantage in their apparel exports. The study is among the first to compare the international competitiveness of apparel industries between the two major apparel exporting countries by using TCT.}

Technology critics and sociologists of memory alike argue that daily exposure to overwhelming flows of information is undermining our ability to connect and synthesize past and present. Acknowledging the salience of these concerns our approach seeks to understand the contemporary conditions of collective memory practice in relation to processes of digitization. We do so by developing an analysis of how digital technologies (image and audio capture, storage, editing, reproduction, distribution and exhibition) have become embedded in wider memory practices of storytelling and commemoration in a community setting: the Salford Lads Club, an organization in the north of England in continuous operation since 1903. The diverse memory practices prompted by the 100th anniversary of the Club’s annual camp provide a context in which to explore the transformations of access, interpretation and use, that occur when the archives of civic organizations are digitized. Returning to Halbwachs’ (1992) seminal insight that all collective memory requires a material social framework, we argue, contrary to prevailing characterizations of digitization, that under specific conditions, digital resources facilitate new forms of materialization that contribute to sustaining a civic organization’s intergenerational continuity.}

Arendt approached the “European question” as a fundamental question for the future of democracy and civil rights in a globalized age, and a necessity for moving beyond the European nation-state model of political organization after the horrors of Nazi totalitarianism. Her work hereby shifts the focus from today’s much-lamented crisis of post-national democracy back to reflecting on the “chronic crisis”, contradictions and legacies of the European nation-state and of national sovereignty – a crisis that partly motivated the evolution of new European democratic beginnings in the first place. Moving beyond both national sovereignty and technocratic supra-national governance, Arendt’s critique lies the foundation for post-sovereign models of European politics and provides a rich resource for rethinking the conditions, justifications and legitimacy of European democracy today.}

Findings indicated that the Egyptian government and chain-managed five-star hotels implemented a number of initiatives and practices focused on financial policies, health and hygiene, workforce and training, marketing, domestic tourism, booking flexibility, cancellation policies, community support, vacations, and contracts. This study contributes to crisis management research by being one of the first studies to explore governments and hotel operations practices and initiatives during the COVID-19 using Egypt as a case study. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications during and post the COVID-19.}

abstract = {The self-sensing ability of materials, in particular carbon fiber polymer composites (SSCFPC), is a must-have requirement when designing a structural monitoring network for remote assessment of structural serviceability. This work presents a study using an Artificial Deep Neural Network (ADNN) wherein is evaluated the electrical resistance (R) output of specimens subjected to an unchanged deformation state of 2.86% strain for prolonged periods of time. Six ADNN architectures are evaluated with varying numbers of neurons on pre-defined hidden layers, sharing the same four data inputs and one output. The dataset is based on 3276 data points collected during the experimental campaign of an innovative electrode design embedded in SSCFPC specimens. The effect of the number of iterations and the architecture of the neural network is investigated in proposed ADNN models. Simple moving average, and moving Standard Deviation, , are determined and plotted in terms of z-score to assist in performance evaluation of proposed ADNN models. The optimal ADNN architecture is found among six proposed architectures and for each of the four SSCFPC mixtures. Results show the proposed model architectures are able to predict values of R with greater accuracy than traditional regression mathematical methods when traditional statistical coefficients are used. However, when analyzing data in a time-series manner, results show further research is needed to achieve optimal accuracy results. The analysis presented focused on the structural monitoring network infrastructure and hardware electronics compatibility for further development of this type of SSCFPC as a self-sensing composite material with ability of automatic calibration and suitable for real-time data acquisition and artificial intelligence modeling.}

The National Broadband Network is promoted as a catalyst for far-reaching changes in Australia’s economy, governmental service provision, society and culture. However, it is evident that desired dividends, such as greater social engagement, enhanced cultural awareness and increased civic and political participation, do not flow automatically from mere technical connection to the network. This article argues that public institutions play a vital role in redistributing technological capacity to enable emerging forms of social and cultural participation. In particular, we examine public libraries as significant but often overlooked sites in the evolving dynamic between digital technology, new cultural practices and social relations. Drawing on interviews and fieldwork across the public library network of the state of Queensland, we attend to the strategies and approaches libraries are adopting in response to a digital culture.}

abstract = {In the course of digitization, the traditional business model of news organizations has been substantially challenged, making innovative formats necessary to master the business of online news. Native advertising (i.e., sponsored articles) is considered an escape from this dilemma. In adapting to journalistic content, this advertising format is distinct from conventional online advertising and allows advertisers to convey persuasive messages in an unobtrusive manner. However, despite its financial benefits, there are ethical concerns about native advertising, which is inherently and intentionally deceptive to its audience. Moreover, native advertising perforates the normative wall separating journalistic responsibilities from advertisers’ interests. In news organizations, this is reflected in the relationship between journalists and advertising sales managers. The present study therefore explored how individuals in these two roles differ in their perceptions of risks and opportunities related to native advertising and in how they cope with ethical concerns. Exploring the power relations between journalists and sales managers in collaborations on native advertising, this study also sheds light on potential restrictions of journalistic autonomy caused by native advertising.}

We propose the notion of data ageism to conceptualise the production and reproduction of the disadvantaged status of old age caused by decisions concerning how to collect and deliver whose data. We exemplify this concept by examining data produced by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, which offers high-quality statistics on digitisation, but no data on individuals aged 75 years and over.}

While the digitisation of the infrastructures that underpin forensic service delivery promised connectivity, prosperity and wellbeing, in reality it also brought forward new levels of risk and vulnerability, generating new tensions and frictions in the body politic. As genetic science reaches post-archival horizons through new genetic sequencing technologies, forensic science in post-archival times raises questions concerning the differential impact of the fragmentation of analytical and archival infrastructures and increasingly asynchronous bureaucracies whose role is displaced by the relative autonomy of datasets and computational architectures that elude governance, oversight and citizens’ scrutiny.}

Research has persuasively shown how the participatory promise of digital parties often degenerated into “plebiscitarianism 2.0.” However, partly because of the mutual disengagement between these fields, the mismatch between promise and reality remains poorly understood. This article argues that, in the case of Podemos, this gap arises from the party’s populist project to turn widespread public disaffection into political power—a project that, as populism typically does, involved the use of plebiscitarian linkages and, therefore, was contradictory to the promise of promoting participatory democracy. By bridging the gap between populism and digital party research, this article calls attention to how populist actors use digital media not only to bypass traditional gatekeepers but also to replace political parties with online plebiscites.}

We plug this gap by first discussing mobile shopper marketing and its scope in depth and then presenting a process model that connects the mobile shopping journey with four key entities, i.e., shopper, employee, organization, and mobile technology.

In hospital, European Union (EU)-social partners build bridges that span otherwise separate actors or groups. The findings suggest that the absence of bridging efforts can lead to the dominance of a few actors. In metalworking, small cohesive groups are more effective in forming close networks and determining work programmes. While work programmes in hospital represent issues which are on national agendas, in metalworking, they focus mainly on EU policy areas.}

What is normalized at this level is not corruption, but its tolerance, which we disaggregate into agent-focused tolerance and structure-focused tolerance. Emphasizing the importance of non-corrupt bystanders, we claim that second-order normalization helps corruption persist in situations where its presence is openly acknowledged. This adds an important new dimension to normalization theory and we unpack its implications for both future research and practice in this area.}

First, based on a computer-aided text analysis of 5,922 articles published in the four major marketing journals between 1990 and 2021, we analyze how conceptual contributions have changed over time using the MacInnis (2011) framework. Results indicate that over the past three decades, theorizing efforts have strongly favored “envisioning” and “explicating” at the expense of “relating” and “debating,” with this imbalance increasing over time. Second, drawing on 48 in-depth interviews with editors, department heads, and authors, we seek to validate these patterns and uncover their underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicate that a prevalent thought style has developed in the field—defined by the research ideals of novelty, clarity, and quantification—that shapes the collective view of how marketing scholars, in their roles as authors, reviewers, and mentors, can make a valuable contribution to marketing scholarship. This thought style favors envisioning and explicating contributions and disfavors relating and debating contributions. Jointly, the two studies point to several rebalancing options that can reinvigorate relating and debating contributions while preserving the current strengths of the marketing field.}

An adaptive hybrid structure is developed at digital and physical prototype level, where its behaviour is examined in real time under the influence of physical conditions. The development is based on a holistic design approach driven by environmental and human activity related conditions, while focusing on the application of elastic materials and embedded technology.}

While architecture schools have sought to integrate BIM into their curricula, most current pedagogical approaches and lessons are derived from engineering and construction management perspectives. There is a scarcity of investigations to monitor outcomes, reveal difficulties and articulate strategies for this context. This research explores how to better incorporate BIM into the architectural design curriculum. It does so by gathering pedagogical strategies, redesigning the curriculum and taking action in one of Thailand’s top architecture schools. The study reveals that treating BIM as a discrete topic in the architectural curriculum – where BIM is not so much the main focus, is misunderstood and is alleged to jeopardize creativity – is ineffective. Instead, infusing BIM learning modules throughout the existing curriculum structure, core design studio and supporting areas allows for the consistent and concurrent development of BIM skills and architectural knowledge. The concepts and practice examples developed in this research, along with feedback received and challenges met, constitute a valuable resource for further BIM-integrated architecture curriculum development. Future studies are recommended to improve BIM learning and advance the full potential of BIM in the education of next-generation architects.}

In particular, an increased interest in the notion of place has emerged in examining smart city development, digital engagement, and people–technology relationships in hybrid physical–digital space. In this article, a place-centric perspective is employed to investigate digitally enhanced people–space interactions. Based on a multimethod research design that combines physical survey, field observation, and interview, this research employs a case study of a shopping mall to examine people’s everyday practices of digitally enabled placemaking. It is found that a range of digital interfaces functions as a system at various proxemic scales in hybrid space, which open up new spatialities by mediating trans-scale placemaking practices. Type-forms of digitally enabled people–space interactions are also summarized. The paper concludes that digitally enabled placemaking in this particular case is constituted within a closed mechanism. Future research directions are also raised at the end.}

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has rapidly involved the entire world and exposed the pressing need for collaboration between public health and other stakeholders from the clinical, scientific, regulatory, pharmaceutical, and medical device and technology communities. To discuss how to best protect people with diabetes from serious outcomes from COVID-19, Diabetes Technology Society, in collaboration with Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, hosted the “International COVID-19 and Diabetes Virtual Summit” on August 26-27, 2020. This unique, unprecedented real-time conference brought together physicians, scientists, government officials, regulatory experts, industry representatives, and people with diabetes from six continents to review and analyze relationships between COVID-19 and diabetes. Over 800 attendees logged in. The summit consisted of five sessions: (I) Keynotes, (II) Preparedness, (III) Response, (IV) Recovery, and (V) Surveillance; eight parts: (A) Background, (B) Resilience, (C) Outpatient Care, (D) Inpatient Care, (E) Resources, (F) High-Risk Groups, (G) Regulation, and (H) The Future; and 24 sections: (1) Historic Pandemics and Impact on Society, (2) Pathophysiology/Risk Factors for COVID-19, (3) Social Determinants of COVID-19, (4) Preparing for the Future, (5) Medications and Vaccines, (6) Psychology of Patients and Caregivers, (7) Outpatient Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Non-Pharmacologic Intervention, (8) Technology and Telehealth for Diabetes Outpatients, (9) Technology for Inpatients, (10) Management of Diabetes Inpatients with COVID-19, (11) Ethics, (12) Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests, (13) Children, (14) Pregnancy, (15) Economics of Care for COVID-19, (16) Role of Industry, (17) Protection of Healthcare Workers, (18) People with Diabetes, (19) International Responses to COVID-19, (20) Government Policy, (21) Regulation of Tests and Treatments, (22) Digital Health Technology, (23) Big Data Statistics, and 24) Patient Surveillance and Privacy. The two keynote speeches were entitled (1) COVID-19 and Diabetes—Meeting the Challenge and (2) Knowledge Gaps and Research Opportunities for Diabetes and COVID-19. While there was an emphasis on diabetes and its interactions with COVID-19, the panelists also discussed the COVID-19 pandemic in general. The meeting generated many novel ideas for collaboration between experts in medicine, science, government, and industry to develop new technologies and disease treatment paradigms to fight this global pandemic.}

abstract = {Background New patient-centric integrated care models are enabled by the capability to exchange the patient’s data amongst stakeholders, who each specialise in different aspects of the patient’s care. This requires a robust, trusted and flexible mechanism for patients to offer consent to share their data. Furthermore, new IT technologies make it easier to give patients more control over their data, including the right to revoke consent. These characteristics challenge the traditional paper-based, single-organisation-led consent process. The Dovetail digital consent application uses a mobile application and blockchain based infrastructure to offer this capability, as part of a pilot allowing patients to have their data shared amongst digital tools, empowering patients to manage their condition within an integrated care setting. Objective To evaluate patient perceptions towards existing consent processes, and the Dovetail blockchain based digital consent application as a means to manage data sharing in the context of diabetes care. Method Patients with diabetes at a General Practitioner practice were recruited. Data were collected using focus groups and questionnaires. Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts and descriptive statistics of the questionnaires was performed. Results There was a lack of understanding of existing consent processes in place, and many patients did not have any recollection of having previously given consent. The digital consent application received favourable feedback, with patients recognising the value of the capability offered by the application. Patients overwhelmingly favoured the digital consent application over existing practice. Conclusions Digital consent was received favourably, with patients recognising that it addresses the main limitations of the current process. Feedback on potential improvements was received. Future work includes confirmation of results in a broader demographic sample and across multiple conditions.}

abstract = {Objective Since the 1990s, almost all healthcare organisations have had electronic health records (EHR) to organise and manage treatment, care and work routines. This article aims to understand how healthcare professionals (HCPs) make sense of digital documentation practice. Methods Based on a case study design, field observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted in a Danish municipality. A systematic analysis based on Karl Weick’s sensemaking theory was applied to investigate what cues HCPs extract from timetables in the EHR and how institutional logics frame the enactment of documentation practice. Results The analysis uncovered three themes: making sense of planning, making sense of tasks and making sense of documentation. The themes illustrate that HCPs make sense of the digital documentation practice as a dominant managerial tool designed to control resources and work routines. This sensemaking leads to a task-oriented practice which centres on delivering fragmented tasks according to a timetable. Conclusion HCPs mitigate fragmentation by responding to a care professional logic, where they document to share information and carry out invisible work outside of timetables and scheduled tasks. However, HCPs are focused on solving specific tasks by the minute with the possible consequence that continuity and their overview of the service user’s care and treatment disappear. In conclusion, the EHR system eliminates a holistic view of care trajectories, leaving it up to HCPs to collaborate in an effort to obtain continuity for the service user.}

In this paper, we seek to examine the effect of knowledge familiarity (client-supplier and supplier-client) and relational familiarity on innovation outcomes. Further, we also examine whether the presence of advisors improves innovation outcomes. Our results suggest that a higher degree of relational familiarity and client-supplier knowledge familiarity are associated with better innovation outcomes. We also reveal that client-supplier knowledge familiarity mediates the effect of supplier-client knowledge familiarity on innovation outcomes. We did not find support for the direct effect of advisors on innovation outcomes. Instead, the presence of advisors moderates the effect of supplier-client and relational familiarity on innovation outcomes. We consider the implications for the IS outsourcing literature and practice.}

I study the traditional “morgue” of physical clippings and photos, the Times’ joint project with Google Cloud to digitize its photo collection, and the TimesMachine interactive digital archive, which made scanned editions of printed issues from 1851 to 2002 publicly available online. Based on interviews with staff and analysis of documents describing past and present newspaper archiving practices, it is clear that the digital archive is not a comprehensive copy of an analogue original. There are a significant number of documents stored in physical archives that have not been translated to digital, and whose loss would be detrimental to historians and media scholars alike. Moreover, even the documents that have been scanned and made available as digital objects do not perfectly mirror their analogue equivalents, meaning that information loss is inherent to the digitization process. As active producers of the past for contemporary purposes, these online news archives serve as cultural gatekeepers, actively shaping journalistic practice and reframing current events in reference to the past.}

abstract = {In knowledge networks, such as best-practice networks, industry forums, and professional communities, members of different organizations exchange knowledge for mutual and individual benefit. When properly managed, knowledge networks enable time- and resource-constrained individuals to engage across organizational and industry boundaries. Such networks often involve deliberate orchestration by a hub actor (individual, team, or organization), often referred to as the orchestrator. Orchestration in a network of individuals is essentially a form of brokering behavior. While most previous studies of orchestration and brokerage have adopted a broker-centric perspective, the present study advances an alter-oriented account of how brokering behavior influences relationships to create knowledge-related benefits for individual network members. Drawing on interviews with 51 members of a Belgian knowledge network focusing on best practices in research and development, this study explores the orchestrator’s brokering behavior and ensuing benefits for network members. Based on these findings, the study describes an integrative model of alter-oriented brokering processes that modify, intermediate, and maintain relationships among alters in orchestrated knowledge networks. The study contributes by conceptualizing alter-orientation as a distinct brokering behavior, by unpacking the microfoundations of brokering in knowledge network orchestration, and by demonstrating the dynamics between knowledge and social dimensions of knowledge network orchestration.}

abstract = {This paper explores how the playing of Pokémon Go can cause power to be assembled, and team-based expressions of territoriality to manifest. By playing the game, players become embedded within digital assemblages of power, which they reproduce through their interactions with other players, game features, and public spaces. When digital assets—such as gyms—are indexed to public spaces, players work together in teams to compete for digital ownership, and control, of these assets. In turn, this leads to the forging of a team-based sense of territoriality that is pervasive, and maximized by consolidating the power of the assemblage. Qualitative data are presented to empirically explore how playing Pokémon Go in Singapore can encourage players to forge a team-based sense of territoriality, which in turn results in the (dis)assembling of power. To conclude, I call for closer consideration of the implications of digital assemblages of power for everyday life.}

A survey questionnaire on a sample of 106 firms is carried out, and results of hierarchical linear regressions indeed reveal that organizational learning shows a direct or indirect influence on dynamic capabilities through transactional or transformational leadership, depending on the type of department. This study is an innovative attempt to distinguish different antecedents for each type of dynamic capability on the basis of the type of learning and strategic leadership involved.

Drawing from critical disability scholarship, we introduce the notions of data ableism and data disablism, which encapsulate privileged ability expectations pertaining to data production and the resulting forms of exclusion that are prevalent in automated societies. Underlining the intersectional nature of data ableism, we discern its two main mechanisms, namely data (in)visibility and data (un)desirability, and document the role of free market ideology in producing and upholding data ableism.}

Since these studies focus on agency almost exclusively from a structural perspective, a qualitative study is conducted to explore the use of Google Maps in everyday life. 20 interviews with German users show that digitalization and datafication profoundly change the dynamics of how agency is perceived and reflected. It can be understood as a form of extension of agency because it is deeply rooted in the entanglement of Google Maps’ infrastructure and city dwellers everyday practices.}

We aimed to understand perceived barriers and facilitators to the provision of digital sexual health services during the first months of the pandemic. Methods: An online survey and qualitative interviews with UK sexual healthcare professionals recruited online and via snowball sampling were conducted in May–July 2020. Results: Amongst 177 respondents (72% female, 86% White, mean age = 46, SD = 9), most utilised telephone and email as their main communication channels; however, their perceived effectiveness varied (94% and 66%, respectively). Most agreed that staff needed additional training (89%), the available technology was not adequate (66%) and health professionals were hesitant to provide online consultations (46%). They had positive attitudes towards digitalisation, improving service quality and cost-effectiveness but were concerned about exacerbating health inequalities. Discussion: The study identifies a need for clear guidelines and training around the use of digital tools as well as a demand for investment in hardware and software required for the provision of remote services. Future research needs to explore the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of various digital tools to narrow health inequalities in sexual health service users.}

The study proposes that, in advanced digital solutions, all parts of the solution development process require co-creation, either direct or indirect. In particular, forming IS–business partnerships, one of the spanning capabilities which integrates with internal organizational processes shows great potential in value co-creation. Originality builds on the understanding of which IS capabilities are essential when advanced digital solution suppliers offer services to their customers in the B2B context. This outcome contributes to the IS capabilities literature by showing the shift in focus from technically oriented capabilities to relationship-oriented capabilities in value co-creation.}

The classification procedure is the result of a pattern recognition experiment using a sample of 223 leukocytes distributed evenly over the five normal cell types. The basic data for each cell were three digital microscopic images obtained with narrow band illumination at the above central wavelengths using a TV-digitizer system interfaced to a PDP-15 computer. The classification algorithm involves a sequential decision procedure utilizing five pattern features computed from the intensity histograms of the green and blue digital images. Thus the number of arithmetic operations and the number of computer memory words necessary to perform the classification into one of the five normal white blood cell types are both proportional to n where n is the number of gray levels into which the intensity scale is divided. In this experiment, n equals 256. Comparison of our results with work of others on smears prepared with Romanowski-type stains indicates that such narrow-band, spectrally well separated cytochemical multiple stains can permit the use of algorithms which are approximately ten times faster.}

abstract = {Datafication and the use of algorithmic systems increasingly blur distinctions between policy fields. In the financial sector, for example, algorithms are used in credit scoring, money has become transactional data sought after by large data-driven companies, while financial technologies (FinTech) are emerging as a locus of information warfare. To grasp the context specificity of algorithmic governance and the assumptions on which its evaluation within different domains is based, we comparatively study the sociotechnical imaginaries of algorithmic governance in European Union (EU) policy on online disinformation and FinTech. We find that sociotechnical imaginaries prevalent in EU policy documents on disinformation and FinTech are highly divergent. While the first can be characterized as an algorithm-facilitated attempt to return to the presupposed status quo (absence of manipulation) without a defined future imaginary, the latter places technological innovation at the centre of realizing a globally competitive Digital Single Market.}

abstract = {This study explores the Health Code (Chinese: 健康码), a digital contact tracing application used in Mainland China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examines the process and impact of its entry into users’ lives and gradual infrastructuralisation within the field of internet infrastructure research. Results show that techno-nationalism was the basis for the inception, implementation, and development of the Health Code. Furthermore, the Health Code has gradually transformed from an early digital health credential into a type of “access infrastructure” by linking physical, information, and communication infrastructure. As access infrastructure, the relationship between the Health Code and users was a tense one, with users actively engaging in “micro-help” on social media platforms and performing “soft-resistance” on psychological and operational levels. Concurrently, the Health Code was embedded into users’ usage habits and social culture, becoming a shared memory and potential digital infrastructure for the future.}

Media delivery – the sum of the value-adding tasks necessary to transfer content from source to audience – has become a mosaic of technologies that sustain a complex and fast-evolving video ecosystem. Broadcasters had been in charge of the full transmission process once, of tasks deemed core to their business. Today, media delivery is externalized to the market and devolved to a network of suppliers. These suppliers are no ordinary firms, but tech giants that have developed deep global capabilities. They gain further leverage by being cross-sectoral, serving clients across multiple industries. Who are these suppliers? What makes them unique? And what are the implications for the television industry?}

Focusing on Spain, three main issues are analysed. First, after considering the legal classification of this type of service provision and its implications, the scheme within the social security system that corresponds to the registration of the service providers is identified. Second, how registration and subsequent social security contributions affect the generosity of social benefits is clarified. In particular, attention is paid to both the risk of partial, or total, lack of, protection due to the absence of compulsory contributions and the low-level of contributions made by the self-employed. And third, the impact the development of the platform economy may have on the financing of social security and its future sustainability – given the current difficulties confronting the Spanish economy – is examined. Some recommendations relating to these three issues are outlined as concluding remarks.}

Yet in Europe a mixture of technological, economic, and political factors paved the way in the 1980s for the introduction of market forces in the industry. Proponents of deregulation often argue that diversity might be achieved more “freely” under market mechanisms. Critics, however, are expressing concern that market forces have led to unprecedented levels of concentration in the media field, resulting in less diversity of access and diversity of choice. The primary objective of this article is to show that the range of opinions to which the consumer-citizen has access is being limited by current media (particularly broadcasting) market structures on both sides of the Atlantic.}

This article asks how the seemingly heterogeneous approaches of market making and ethical AI are woven together at a deeper level in EU regulation. Combining quantitative analysis of all official EU documents on AI with in-depth reading of key reports, communications, and legislative corpora, we demonstrate that single market integration constitutes a fundamental but overlooked engine and structuring principle of new AI regulation. Under the influence of this principle, removing barriers to competition and the free flow of data, on the one hand, and securing ethical and responsible AI, on the other hand, are seen as compatible and even mutually reinforcing.}

It owes its existence to a simple observation: the evolution of journalism is accompanied by the emergence of ever-new journalism-related terms, i.e. combinations of the word “journalism” with a particular modifying term that represents and signals a certain specificity and novelty. Examples include “robot journalism”, “foundation-funded journalism”, “cross-border journalism”, or “solutions journalism” – just to name a few. To date, we have collected and mapped 166 X journalisms and have “crowd-categorized” them into clusters according to the different aspects they refer to. We explore X Journalism as a concept, present our mapping, and show how it can help to cope with journalism’s increasing complexity, grasp the diversity of the field, trace its constant evolution, as well as identify patterns and interrelations between these different movements and occurrences. Through a test case of audience-related X journalisms we demonstrate an empirical application before illustrating the theoretical compatibility of X Journalism and suggesting a research agenda that highlights potentials for X Journalism-driven studies.}

The article argues that these imaginaries have contributed to the banking industry’s move toward becoming payment platforms, which restructure financial services based on a “re-personalization of money.” In effect, digital payments play a central part in the current economic transformation, led and promoted by global tech giants, that builds on the tracking, production, categorization, and classification of digital data. The article zooms in on recent and current expectations and imaginaries in the banking industry that, in the short run, shape economic decisions, while, in the long run, are set out to change how people interact, and how they are tracked, scored, and categorized.}

This study aims to examine how policy attention affects e-government performance through the mediating effect of resource allocation and the moderating effect of public–private collaboration. Analysis of panel data from 333 prefectural governments in China confirms that policy attention can increase e-government performance, but the effect size decreases under the mediating role of financial and human resources. Furthermore, higher public–private collaboration weakens the positive effect of government resources on e-government performance and policy attention on e-government performance. Points for practitioners This article can help practitioners recognize the importance of policy attention in guiding e-government implementation by verifying policy attention–resource allocation–e-government performance association. Moreover, this study also provides some suggestions for practitioners seeking to collaborate with private organizations by confirming the negative role of public–private collaboration between government resources and e-government performance.}

The article assesses predictive modelling in housing enforcement in respect of the government of migrant housing precarity in the interstices of rentier and racial capitalism. The article develops two central contentions concerning these proactive state geographies. First, relations between geopolitics, the racialisation of urban space and algorithms need to be situated in relation to institutional state prosaics. “Connecting the dots”, a motif of post-9/11 pre-emptive securitisation, is located in suburban housing enforcement regimes corresponding to the politicisation of overcrowding, while the enactment of data-driven intelligence, including in raids, renews the border in these suburbs. Second, proactive technologies work through state data infrastructures. Geocoding, a technique of urban legibility designating the property grid, organises the algorithmic production of legality/illegality and consequently public health and housing futures in the digital city. While the analysis stems from a specific context, the article aims to contribute to interdisciplinary debates about politics, algorithms and state transformation spanning political, urban and digital geography and cognate fields.}

This paper recasts changes in Western European recordkeeping from the fourteenth to eighteenth century in terms of the differentiation of spaces and practices, thus challenging older literature that sees increasing accumulation around a foundational archivum as the primary mode of expansion. Empirically, the argument concentrates on developments in the German lands that produced highly sophisticated Registratur (practices that tracked and indexed a wide variety of circulating records) across the German sphere after 1400. As first argued by Ernst Pitz, early modern German archivists began differentiating conceptual and physical spaces for recordkeeping in the fifteenth century, thus producing both archives of charters and registries of informational records of many kinds. A close examination of developments in Habsburg Innsbruck confirms that both an ordered archive and a powerful comprehensive system of registry emerged simultaneously in the 1520s in one of the most sophisticated recordkeeping venues of the era. The paper also reconsiders the historiography of archives, emphasizing how the cultural, medial and spatial turns have transformed current research. By contrasting relatively stable medial forms – pen, ink and paper; roll, bundle and codex – with more dynamic and transformative medial configurations which can be studied through the systematic comparison of specific cases, I argue that new research on archival history offers fresh and less culturally bound approaches to the preservation of records in the archives that remain the foundation for historical research into the past.}

The war feed renders the war in and against Ukraine up close and personal. Never have so many images and videos of human suffering and death in war been so quickly available, streaming from the battlefield. A digital multitude posting, liking, sharing, and applauding each individual image or short form video, are all participants in a fractalized psychological war. In this article we propose that the war feed transforms the way war today is perceived, participated in, and fought over, but also how it will be remembered and forgotten. We focus on the messaging app Telegram as a rapidly evolving weapon of psychological warfare, which utterly disrupts the relationship between the showing, hiding, and the seeing of modern war. There seems little point in raging against ineffectual moderation and regulation of social media platforms, whilst the world burns on Telegram.}

Many who appear on mug shot and criminal history websites are arrestees who are never formally charged or convicted of a crime. The indiscriminate posting of all types of justice contact on websites may impact those who, for the most part, desist from crime and are core contributors to their family and community. I find that many of those who are affected by the stigma of online records did not know that records existed until they “popped up” unexpectedly, and that this experience leads them to self-select out of family duties that contribute to child well-being.}

How are platforms becoming geopoliticized? What perspectives shall we use to make sense of the process? This theoretical paper reformulates conceptual apparatuses of liberalism, realism, and constructivism, each represented by a metaphor: the cobweb, billiard balls, and ant societies, respectively. The approaches are introduced, critiqued, and compared to understand platform geopoliticization more historically and imaginatively on global as well as regional and local scales. The discussions propel platform studies to be grounded and multi-layered, concerning not only the apex of politico-economic power but also grassroots and communal praxis, for example, metis. While the pendulum is swinging from transnational capital to nation-states, it is insufficient to restrict our thinking to (neo)realism vis-à-vis (neo)liberalism. A moderate version of constructivism—the “ant societies” model—hence needs articulation, which holds important conceptual and methodological implications.}

abstract = {This study investigates the institutionalization of e-participation initiatives in six European countries—Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain—using a multiple case study. The following research questions are addressed: How have recently established e-participation initiatives been institutionalized in public administrations? What are the formal and informal aspects of their institutionalization? It is concluded that the adoption of a digital solution does not in itself trigger a change in the policy-making process because the institutionalization of e-participation is not a linear process. The formal institutionalization increases the sustainability, transparency, and throughput legitimacy of e-participation and allows citizen proposals to be handled in a standardized way. Although the formal institutionalization of e-participation is key for an institutional change towards deliberative democracy, it needs to be accompanied by informal institutionalization through the supporting ideas, values, and preferences of politicians and public officials who have the power to change public institutions.}

abstract = {This paper traces the development of children’s multiplatform commissioning at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in the context of the digitalisation of Australian television. Whilst recent scholarship has focussed on “post-broadcast” or “second-shift” industrial practices, designed to engage view(s)ers with proprietary media brands, less attention has been focussed on children’s and young adults’ television in a public service context. Further, although multiplatform projects in the United States and Britain have been the subject of considerable analysis, less work has attempted to contextualise cultural production in smaller media markets. The paper explores two recent multiplatform projects through textual analysis, empirical research (consisting of interviews with key industry personnel) and an investigation of recent policy documents. The authors argue that the ABC’s mixed diet of children’s programming, featuring an educative or social developmental agenda, is complemented by its appeals to audience “participation”, with the Corporation maintaining public service values alongside the need to expand audience reach and the legitimacy of its brand. It finds that the ABC’s historical platform infrastructure, across radio, television and online, have allowed it to move beyond a market failure model to exploit multiplatform synergies competitively in the distribution of Australian children’s content to audiences on-demand.}

abstract = {Background The digital revolution has had a huge impact on healthcare around the world. Digital technology could dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment, health outcomes, efficiency of care, and workflow of healthcare operations. Using health information technology will bring major improvements in patient outcomes. Purpose This study aims to measure the readiness for digital health transformation at different hospitals in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia in relation to Saudi Vision 2030 based on the four dimensions adopted by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society: person-enabled health, predictive analytics, governance and workforce, and interoperability. Methods The study was conducted with a cross-sectional design using data collected through an online questionnaire from 10 healthcare settings, the questionnaire consists of the four digital health indicators. The survey was developed by Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society for the purpose of assessing the level of digital maturity in healthcare settings. Results Ten healthcare facilities in the Eastern Province, both private and governmental, were included in the study. The highest total scores for digital health transformation were reported in private healthcare facilities (median score for private facilities = 77, public facilities = 71). The “governance and workforce” was the most implemented dimension among the healthcare facilities in the study (median = 80), while the dimension that was least frequently implemented was predictive analytics (median score = 70). In addition, tertiary hospitals scored the least in digital transformation readiness (median = 74) compared to primary and secondary healthcare facilities in the study. Conclusion The results of the study show that private healthcare facilities scored higher in digital health transformation indicators. These results will be useful for promoting policymakers’ understanding of the level of digital health transformation in the Eastern Province and for the creation of a strategic action plan.}

However, digital financial literacy as a compound concept is novel and still needs to be explored in the scientific literature. This work investigated young people’s perception of their digital financial culture, identified factors that hinder or facilitate it, and explored their preferences in the training modalities for improvement. Twenty-two focus groups were carried out in different Mexican educational institutions based on diversity criteria. The evidence shows that: (1) young people perceive the need for digital financial education linked mainly to the understanding of critical concepts, the use of mobile applications, online financial operations, and digital financial security; (2) some voluntarily exclude themselves from online finance, this being one of the main obstacles in the development of digital financial culture; (3) the digital financial culture gap is accentuated more among young people in public educational institutions and upper secondary education; (4) they have a preference for emerging technological and digital resources for their training in digital finance. These findings make it possible to contextualize training proposals that favor the financial inclusion of young people in complex scenarios brought about by the digital transformation of the economy and society.}

Drawing on the formal system theory and the literature review, we developed a collaborative network governance framework for aligning ecosystems and creating public value. This framework is applied to guide case study research to identify enablers and inhibitors of strategic alignment and public value creation in the Federal Court of Australia context. We found evidence for collaborative network governance in facilitating court judges and practitioners to assimilate e-justice subsystems in open justice practice, with impacts on enhanced operational efficiency and service level. These realized economic and social values in turn provided the federal court with political return on investments in digital transformation of the court services and the legitimacy of open justice practice.}

abstract = {Digital innovation enables new forms of cyber-physical innovation based on digital business ecosystems. However, the realization of the opportunities arising from such innovation substantially hinges on interoperability, that is, the ability of two or more systems to exchange information and understand that exchanged information. While interoperability is a long-standing topic in research and practice alike and a valuable knowledge base exists, digital innovation poses novel challenges that might not be covered by conventional wisdom. Accordingly, we review the literature and, first, propose an organizing framework for existing interoperability knowledge involving the contextual conditions of low interoperability, the mechanisms to increase interoperability, and the associated outcomes. Second, we use the framework to identify previous research foci in the scholarly discourse about interoperability and to discuss the potential limitations of this past work in light of digital innovation. Third, we propose a research agenda that enables information systems (IS) research to address the identified limitations—involving conceptual, scoping, and methodological issues—and provide specific recommendations on how to address the identified issues in future IS research. Finally, we propose five major research topics for further inquiry by combining the challenges identified in current knowledge with the current shift toward hyper-connected ecosystems underlying digital innovation.}

The study proposes a novel method to identify relevant search terms and to aggregate them into a compound web-search index, used as additional input of an autoregressive prediction approach. As methods to predict tourism arrivals, the study compares autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with the machine learning–based technique artificial neural network (ANN). Study results show that (1) Google Trends data, mirroring traveler’s online search behavior (i.e., big data information source), significantly increase the performance of tourist arrival prediction compared to autoregressive approaches using past arrivals alone, and (2) the machine learning technique ANN has the capacity to outperform ARIMA models.}

Frequently, however, the use of these concepts is implicit, heterogeneous, and proliferating. These concepts, thus, lack the “conceptual clarity” necessary in research. Therefore, this article aims at a conceptual clarification of digital human resource management and of related concepts of the digitization of human resource management, the digitalization of human resource management, the digital transformation of human resource management, and the digital disruption of human resource management. To do so, the article references general literature on digital organizations to develop a terminology and typology of digital human resource management. The terminology offers precise and parsimonious definitions of the concepts and relationships between them, offering a basic understanding. The typology offers precise and parsimonious ideal-types, which order and classify phenomena related to digital human resource management, in turn expanding knowledge about these phenomena. Together, the terminology and typology clarify the concept of digital human resource management and related concepts, uncover digital human resource management as an evolutionary advancement of previous conceptualizations of technology-based human resource management, and provide a conceptual basis for future work on digital human resource management.}

Students and faculty members were thrown into the process of acquainting themselves with a fully virtual system. How prepared were institutions, faculty members, and students for the abrupt and massive transition to online learning? The study examined the faculty and students’ perspective of online learning during COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the study examined the perceptions of faculty and students on the preparedness of higher education institutions for online teaching and learning. The study also determined the perceptions of staff and students towards online education, constraints, and opportunities. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted at a public university in Kenya. A semi-structured interview was conducted on a total sample of 36 respondents; 24 students and 12 faculty members to capture unique, idiosyncratic and whole individual viewpoints. A conventional Content Analysis was done to determine words or concepts within the transcripts. The findings showed that the study institution, faculty members, and students were unprepared for the immediate and massive shift to online teaching and learning and had challenges using virtual technologies for teaching and learning during the lockdown. These challenges ranged from insufficient or lack of internet bandwidth, training, increased teaching and learning workloads to limited time for interactions. Based on the findings, the study suggests significant implications for higher education institution leaders, policymakers, faculty, and students. The study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing the perceptions of faculty and students about the preparedness of institutions, faculty, and students on the abrupt shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Reflecting on the findings of a small-scale qualitative research on the use of dating apps among young adults in London, we problematise this view and argue that the specific form of marketisation articulated by dating apps is entrepreneurial in kind, whereby individuals act as brands facing the structural uncertainty of interacting with “quasi-strangers”. In so doing, we argue, dating app users enact a Luhmanian notion of interpersonal trust, built on the assessment of the risk of interacting with unfamiliar others that is typical of digitally mediated contexts dominated by reputational logics. From a sociocultural perspective, dating apps emerge as sociotechnical apparatuses that remediate the demand to rationally choose a partner while at the same time reproducing the (im)possibility of doing so. In this respect, far from offering a new form of efficiency, they (re)produce the ontological uncertainty (Illouz, 2019) that characterises lovers as entrepreneurs.}

However, less attention has been paid to the way these populist messages appear through political actors’ Facebook communication, and what post- and page-level factors they are associated with. We investigate these questions in the context of the 2019 European Parliament election based on a unique cross-national dataset covering twelve European countries. In this study, we categorized 8,074 Facebook posts published on the main Facebook pages of sixty-seven parties. Our findings show that different populist appeals are used in specific ways. For example, at the post level, anti-elitism is frequently used in relation to economy, labor and social policy, and immigration; people-centric appeals are associated with labor and social policy and used when parties call for action, while out-group messages are not related to other topics beyond immigration. “Ideational populist” communication is more frequently articulated in European level and related to the topics of economy and labor and social policy. At the party level, it seems that there are still sharp differences between populist and non-populist parties in their communication.}

The procedure was as follows: (1) search of articles, (2) quality assessment, (3) extraction of data from articles, and (4) thematic synthesis. The review concluded that the term “consumer happiness” does not have a standardized definition in the existing literature. However, happiness has been studied in a variety of contexts, and consumer research is one of these contexts. Further, the review concluded that consumer happiness research is largely segregated across three themes: marketing beyond satisfaction, marketing for health and mind, and digital felicity. Seven areas of future research on consumer happiness are also proposed. The authors present academic and managerial contributions with scholarly implications for the literature in the areas of consumer well-being, the role of marketing/interactive marketing, and the positive side of marketing. The authors also suggest that marketers not only seek consumers’ need fulfillment and satisfaction from their product or service consumption but also try to elicit hedonic associations with their products or services.}

While algorithmic management has been observed primarily within the platform-mediated gig economy, its transformative reach and consequences are also spreading to more standard work settings. Exploring algorithmic management as a sociotechnical concept, which reflects both technological infrastructures and organizational choices, we discuss how algorithmic management may influence existing power and social structures within organizations. We identify three key issues. First, we explore how algorithmic management shapes pre-existing power dynamics between workers and managers. Second, we discuss how algorithmic management demands new roles and competencies while also fostering oppositional attitudes toward algorithms. Third, we explain how algorithmic management impacts knowledge and information exchange within an organization, unpacking the concept of opacity on both a technical and organizational level. We conclude by situating this piece in broader discussions on the future of work, accountability, and identifying future research steps.}

abstract = {We explore smart city development, with a focus on the modalities of citizen participation, using an institutional logics approach. Taking Mexico City as our case study, we describe the presence and dynamics of several logics influencing smart city development. At an organizational level we identify the bureaucratic and technocratic logics underpinning the practices of the governmental agency leading smart city development. Characterized by centralization and the pursuit of efficiency, and framed by a discourse of austerity and financial control, these logics promote a modality of citizen participation that is limited and unidirectional in nature, with citizens positioned largely as users. At a supra-organizational level, we identify a logic of active citizen participation in urban governance that is formalized in city laws. However, this logic is itself entangled in a logic of clientelism and patronage, manifested through networks of power. These logics work synergistically to limit broader, inclusive citizen participation in, and realization of benefits from, smart city agendas. We conclude that a richer understanding of institutional logics enhances the analysis of the social construction of the smart city in particular, situated contexts.}

abstract = {This study aims to understand how people engage with art in the era of selfies, digital devices, and social media. It examines the audience experience of an art exhibition, where visitors are encouraged to use social media to share their art experience, to understand how such an approach might change the nature of visitor engagement with art. Arguably, selfies taken in the art space enrich the visitor’s experience and engagement with art and function as co-creational, empowering, and authentic marketing tools for museums. Data for this research were collected through non-participant observation (ethnography) and netnography at the National Gallery of Victoria, in Melbourne, Australia. The results show that rather than promoting disengagement from the art piece, selfies in the art space become “networked material-discursive entanglements” empowering art consumers to co-create value and arts organizations to reduce their distance from consumers and reproduce the iconic authenticity of the artwork in the virtual space. The article contributes to selfie theory by overcoming the traditional view of selfies as manifestation of narcissistic self-expression. Instead, it promotes an interpretation of selfies as an empowering and democratizing means used by art consumers to develop narratives and identity projects in a context such as the museum where traditionally the development of the narrative is apanage of an elite. A further contribution provided by this research stems from the identification of clusters of visitors (i.e., reality escapers, art lovers, photoholics, and selfie lovers), placed on a continuum of value co-creation, which arts administrators need to be conscious of as they enter a more dynamic era of art consumption. By outlining managerial implications, this study provides an initial reflection on how arts managers can navigate the emerging era of the selfie in the museum context.}

Looking at the effects of this new trend, this article intends to reflect on how NGO communication has concretely changed on a visual and discursive level through the use of animation. The corpus analysed, selected from YouTube, consists of a series of examples of animated online videos of NGOs that deal with a recent and influential phenomenon: the refugee crisis. Since 2015, an increasing number of new NGOs have emerged in order to contribute to aid for migrants, as opposed to European policies: what kind of representation of migrants do NGOs convey in their communication campaigns that employ animation? What kind of solidarity discourse is adopted through this audiovisual language? The analysis of these examples will serve as a basis for introducing the theorisation of numerous characteristics specific to animation, which make it an effective medium for the promotion of humanitarian missions and for the transmission of the testimonies of migrants.}

We argue that the nation nevertheless provides an appropriate frame for understanding age-rating by attending to the ways national agencies have struggled to articulate the specificity of their work based on the specificity of domestic constituencies. Drawing on archival and ethnographic research, our central examples include the resistance of the Motion Picture Association of America to age-based film classification, the British Board of Film Classification’s examination of American films in the 1980s, contemporary Japanese videogame regulation, and the emergence of the International Age Rating Coalition. We argue that national exceptionalism is itself generalised and that media content regulation is less about producing national culture than about laying claim to a nation by differentiation.}

abstract = {In this conceptual article, the authors use a macro-level analysis and normative ethical theory to delineate and to explicate a doctrine of socially responsible marketing (SRM). Applying a theory-in-formation approach, we postulate a literature-informed definition of SRM. We discuss why a macro and normative-ethical rather than a micro and positive-descriptive perspective is essential to justifying the elements of SRM. We explore and explain why the roots of an authentic doctrine of SRM can be discerned from the literatures of marketing history, corporate social responsibility, institutional economics and moral philosophy. In so doing, the mandate to engage in socially responsible marketing is shown to be anchored in a social contract. This conception offers three essential elements of SRM—corporate citizenship, stakeholder orientation and social/ecological sustainability—each of which augers a pro-social rather than instrumental-financial approach to marketing practice. We recommend a specific normative-ethical standard, embodied in distributive justice, to best evaluate SRM. We counsel adopting a macromarketing perspective of constructive engagement for those seeking responsible marketing for a better society and world. Finally, we offer a short research agenda for advancing Marketing’s embrace of SRM.}

Methods Following a scoping study, we undertook 52 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, clinicians, patient representatives and commissioning staff across four case study sites. These sites varied in size, location and grading awarded by a national regulatory body. We explored how services have been repurposed and reorganized in response to the pandemic and the participants’ perceptions of the impact of these changes on quality of care and the wellbeing of staff. Results Mental health trusts have shown great flexibility and resilience in rapidly implementing new models of care and developing creative digital solutions at speed. New collaborative arrangements have been stimulated by a shared sense of urgency and enabled by additional funding and a more permissive policy environment. But there has also been a significant negative impact on the wellbeing of staff, particularly those staff from a minority ethnic background. Also, there were concerns that digital technology could effectively disenfranchise some vulnerable groups and exacerbate existing health inequalities. Conclusions Many of the service changes and digital innovations undertaken during the pandemic appear promising. Nevertheless, those changes need to be urgently and rigorously appraised to assure their effectiveness and to assess their impact on social exclusion and health inequalities.}

When the cells were measured on a scanning cytophotometer, significant differences in stain intensity were found among slides. Significant differences also were found among the leukocyte types. In gallocyanin-chrome alum preparations, monocytes measured 16% higher than small lymphocytes and 13% higher than neutrophilic granulocytes. In Feulgen preparations, monocytes measured 4% higher than small lymphocytes and 6% higher than neutrophils. These differences among cell types were independent of donor and stain intensity. Measurements of cells within types and within slides frequently showed close agreement, but it is only in this very limited context that the data are consistent with the hypothesis of DNA constancy. Measurements made on a two-wavelength cytophotometer showed a divergence of only 2.1% relative to similar measurements made on the scanning cytophotometer, which suggests that the differences observed among cells and types are unlikely to be artifacts of the instruments. Over-all, the data indicate either that there is variability in DNA content or that DNA is not being expressed correctly by the measured stain content.}

Drawing on the walk-through method and semi-structured interviews with WRM’s founders, we examine how the app leverages the power of digital mapping to encourage participation in environmental activities. We argue that by facilitating data and spatial agency, digital maps enable placemaking at the cognitive and hermeneutic levels. They also turn closed spaces into public ones, thus aiding place-shaping. Meanwhile, this digital environmental activism takes place in a field of contestation and negotiation between agency and structure, apps and infrastructural platforms, collective action and individual power, and environmentalism and (adjusted) commercialism.}

However, we know little about how individuals respond to treatment by self-resembling others. Here we approach this problem by connecting facial self-resemblance to social rejection. Given that individuals should expect to cooperate with kin, we hypothesized that (1) social inclusion by perceived kin should elicit lesser feelings of rejection and (2) social exclusion by perceived kin should elicit greater feelings of rejection relative to inclusion or exclusion, respectively, by nonkin. To test these hypotheses, we recruited 90 participants to play two games of Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, with separate pairs of ostensible partners. In one game, the ostensible partners were programed to fully include the participants in group play and, in the other game, they were programed to exclude the participants after a few rounds; the order of inclusion and exclusion was counterbalanced across participants. Partner faces were digitally manipulated to be either self- or nonself-resembling, and these conditions were also counterbalanced. Rejection feelings differed significantly as a function of self-resemblance between the inclusion and exclusion conditions, but only for participants who experienced inclusion first. Moreover, for these individuals, inclusion by self-resembling partners led to significantly lesser feelings of rejection than did inclusion by nonself-resembling partners. To explain this effect, we explore potential mechanisms of kin recognition and social rejection. Although nuanced, our results suggest that perceptions of kinship can moderate psychological responses to the actions of others.}

A qualitative textual analysis of 119 meme instances identified three dimensions of artwork that can be echoed in digital memes: the content, the form, and the artist. Consistent with the metaphor of communication as transmission, the mimesis of content uses artwork as a device for political expression. The mimesis of form and of the artist, on the other hand, provoke a response that emphasizes the aesthetics over the narrative, albeit for contrasting goals: while the former conveys a communal partaking of iconic gestures, which highlights what Carey depicted as the ritual view of communication, the latter distinguishes the imitators as individuals, thus comparing them to the original creator. This article demonstrates the memetic manipulation of fine art as a dual agent of individual and communal expression.}

Many people have already started experiencing an elevated feeling of loneliness, emotional distress, anxious and depressive thoughts related to the concerns for the disrupted social, emotional, spiritual, professional and financial wellbeing of family, friends and self. Many are feeling distressed on recurring thoughts about how long this pandemic will last, whether our family and friends will be infected and how long we will be living in this condition. Hence, the researchers of this study anticipated that the COVID-19 outbreak would be highly stressful to the people and will have psychological consequences of varying degrees. This study examines the relationship of stress, anxiety with health locus of control (HLOC) among entrepreneurs and employees serving in organisations, and the coping strategies they have adopted to overcome it. Using the quasi-experiment method, the data were collected using the perceived stress scale (PSS) and multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC) from 91 entrepreneurs and employees. The findings indicated a significant association between HLOC and stress. It was observed that respondents were aware that the current work stress is arising because of a struggle to balance personal and professional lives during the pandemic. Further, it was also observed that stress was significantly higher in employees than entrepreneurs, and HLOC types positively impacted their stress levels.}

This article responds to such findings by asking whether party elites are embracing interactive digital tools and what explains current practices. This article conducts case studies of two parties within the United Kingdom – the Labour Party and the Green Party. Interviews are used to examine attitudes and practices in two different areas of party activity: electoral campaigning and internal governance. While there is little evidence of elite interest in the interactive potential of digital tools in the former, there is more evidence of interest in the latter area, even though barriers exist that frustrate the enactment of these ideas. Exploring the significance of parties’ objectives and organizational traits, this article examines explanations for these outcomes and, in so doing, helps scholars and practitioners alike to understand, identify and tackle barriers to the adoption of interactive digital tools by party elites.}

abstract = {Labour process approaches have extensively documented the impact of digitalisation and remote work on managerial control, though the role of managers has been less explored. This article fills that gap in the extant literature by examining how adopting remote work affects managerial compliance with corporate goals. Particularly, it shows that this development entails a process of de-institutionalisation and re-institutionalisation of the control regime operating over lower-level managers to act on behalf of companies. These processes are driven by corporate decisions but also by the managers’ attempts to negotiate this regime. Overall, the article claims the need to study managers as agents rather than as a mere extension of the management function or passive subjects of corporate restructurings. The arguments are based on a study conducted in a multinational mining company operating in Chile, which adopted a research-in-action approach and included interviews, document reviews and a survey of line managers.}

abstract = {The transience of digital platforms poses obstacles for platform workers to create stable meaning and identity in online work environments. Extant literature concerned with work-related identity discusses gig-workers coping with the erosion of organizational structures in online spaces through “personalized holding environments”. We add to this literature by illustrating how actors maintain and create digital platforms as collective environments with the capacity for meaningfulness and identity formation. To do so, we draw on Hannah Arendt’s distinction between human activities in labor (serves necessities), work (creates things), and action (provides identity and meaning). Empirically, we autoetnographically investigated two digital platforms reflecting two prevalent narratives of the future of platform work: a platform dedicated to creative collaboration in an online community (FAWM) and a platform associated with precarious microtasking in the gig economy (MTurk). In both cases, we find that labor activities are required to maintain a digital identity and a digital environment. In turn, work activities establish a digital environment in a state of consistency, without ever adding tangible permanence to the human artifice. Thereupon, while establishing the digital platform as a stable collective environment, collective action (e.g. community building) can be performed. Here, we finally argue, lies the future human condition of platform work: in the ongoing care and creation of stable collective environments in a digital space lacking permanence.}

While urgent action is needed, conceptualisations of “the good life” (TGL) as the “imperial mode of living” (IML) of overconsumption are justifications upholding the system and driving forces behind the crises. German trade unions, which, as part of the historic bloc of the growth coalition, have tried to delay climate action in the name of jobs through “praising work”, have supported the hegemonic common sense of IML-TGL. This is an obstacle to environmental union organisation and progressive coalitions for social-ecological transformation. To investigate whether and to what extent divergent good sense counter-hegemonic narratives are present within German trade union discourses, we analyse the narratives of TGL and good work within the three biggest German unions – ver.di, IG Metall, and IG BCE – using Gramsci’s theory of common sense. We find that counter-narratives of TGL are present to different degrees within the unions and amongst interviewees. These can provide entry points for counter-hegemonic narratives of TGL and alliances with societal actors fighting for “solidary modes of living”, or a Good Life for All within planetary boundaries.}

Social network sites have played an important role in these processes, with the rapid emergence of non-traditional actors engaging in activities that may be classified as journalism. Yet, while scholarship on Twitter and Facebook has continually expanded, the visual platform Instagram has received comparatively little attention, despite being an important venue for new forms, particularly in lifestyle journalism. Through an examination of professional lifestyle Instagrammers’ discursive constructions of journalistic boundaries and their role perceptions, this article suggests that in their key values and functional understanding their approach resembles traditional journalistic occupational ideologies, and their role perceptions are very similar to those of lifestyle journalists. The findings contribute to our understanding of transformative processes in journalism more broadly, and their implications for journalistic values, ideals, and practices.}

Smallholder farmers account for between 60–80% of the food produced in the region but face many challenges that impede their productivity. Such challenges include a lack of timely access to appropriate agricultural information and services, which results in poor decision-making, particularly in addressing challenges and responding effectively to opportunities. In that context, the effective use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in improving accessibility to appropriate agricultural information and services presents substantial prospects for transforming the productivity and livelihoods of the farmers. Currently, the region experiences massive penetration and propagation of mobile and web-based applications. However, there is a dearth of compelling, comprehensive reviews evaluating their importance in enhancing agricultural information and services dissemination to smallholder farmers. Therefore, the current review explores the potential of enhancing agricultural information and services dissemination to smallholder farmers through ICTs and highlights gaps in their development and deployment in SSA. Five existing mobile applications used to disseminate agricultural information and services to smallholder farmers were identified, and their advantages, limitations, and opportunities were discussed. These were Esoko, iCow, Community Knowledge Workers, WeFarm and DigiFarm. The development and deployment of user-driven mobile applications that provide curated skill-sharing platforms, encourage farmers to give feedback to extension systems in real-time and promote the participation of women and youth in agriculture are recommended.}

What are the systemic roots of these challenges, and how can we deal with them to support the emergence of sustainable careers? We draw on a sociotechnical approach, supplemented by a dynamic person–environment fit perspective, to describe two systemic challenges tied to the development of sustainable careers in smart cities, namely: (1) an unbalanced fit, in that the highly digitized context fits best with highly educated and information and communications technology (ICT) literate citizens working in knowledge intensive organizations; and (2) a volatility of fit, associated with the complex and fast-changing smart urban context. Based on the sociotechnical analysis, we put forth three suggestions for addressing these challenges and creating a sustainable career ecosystem focused on: (1) the continuous development of ICT literacy, knowledge, talents and skills; (2) citizen participation and career communities; and (3) network-centric organizing of sustainable careers that could alleviate some of the challenges associated with the parallel development of sustainable careers and smart cities.}

Only a few months prior to the latter ruling of the CJEU, the Austrian legislator amended the Working Time Act in order to make it more flexible. The article argues that the measures taken by the Austrian legislator to enable more flexibility and autonomy can still be regarded as compatible with Union law. In general, the article tackles the question of possible further legislative developments in order to strike a balance between autonomy and the need for security of both parties to the employment relationship. Among other suggestions, the article introduces the concept of molecularisation of working time and examines whether work intensity should be introduced as a qualitative dimension to the concept of working time, thus deviating from the current European Working Time Directive. Finally, the article suggests security measures – often referring to Austria as a best practice example – in order to safeguard workers in view of working time flexibility.}

From its inception, such need has been latent in the field, because it deals with novel, fast changing, complex, and systemic phenomena that is hard to account with received theory. We note in this essay that the need for innovative theorizing is heightened given the unprecedented, pervasive digitalization of contemporary society, accelerated by ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this essay, we scrutinize further the idea of blue-ocean theorizing and review the characteristics, impediments, and merits of developing innovative theory. We define endeavors toward such theory as collectively endorsed cognitive processes which increase variance and novelty of theoretical accounts of IS phenomena. These push to deviate from the field’s established theoretical (canonical) core by relaxing six assumptions that guide dominant, legitimate forms of the field’s theorizing. We identify and review institutional barriers that curb the development of innovative theory. In conclusion, we offer guidelines for how the field and its stakeholders can productively engage in developing and evaluating innovative theory.}

abstract = {Over the last two decades, Russian Internet accumulated a range of images originating from the Soviet epoch, including everything from official portraits of Soviet leaders to representations of Soviet greeting cards and postage stamps. While some of those digitised items remain intact, others become a part of different creative practices inherent to online environment, such as photo manipulating, remixing, recombining and merging with elements attributing to other historical or national contexts. The current article investigates one instance of creative re-appropriation of the Soviet visual legacy on the Internet: construction of digital memes from the former Soviet propaganda posters. Upon focusing on three iconic posters, namely Did you Volunteer? (1920), Do not Talk! (1941) and Motherland is Calling! (1941), this study examines how the propaganda images have been transformed by contemporary Russian users into “templates” for meme-making. Furthermore, the article identifies two particular functions of memes based on the Soviet propaganda posters: first, as a form of a peculiar humour, known in Russian tradition as stiob and, second, as an instrument for voicing of public opinion, through which users comment on urgent political and social issues. The article concludes that the remakes of Soviet propaganda images do not fall within any hitherto discovered category of humorous, political or historical memes, and therefore, they should be considered as a separate case in contemporary production of memes.}

Methods Participants (N = 106) in the TVS wore a waist-worn device (McRoberts Dynaport MM + ) for one week. Following this, acceptability of the device was measured using two questionnaires: The Comfort Rating Scale (CRS) and a previously validated questionnaire. A subset of participants (n = 36) also completed semi-structured interviews to further determine device acceptability and to explore their opinions of the use of digital tools to monitor their health. Questionnaire results were analysed descriptively and interviews using a content analysis. Results The device was considered both comfortable (median CRS (IQR; min-max) = 0.0 (0.0; 0–20) on a scale from 0–20 where lower scores signify better comfort) and acceptable (5.0 (0.5; 3.0–5.0) on a scale from 1–5 where higher scores signify better acceptability). Interviews showed it was easy to use, did not interfere with daily activities, and was comfortable. The following themes emerged from participants’ as being important to digital technology: altered expectations for themselves, the use of technology, trust, and communication with healthcare professionals. Conclusions Digital tools may bridge existing communication gaps between patients and clinicians and participants are open to this. This work indicates that waist-worn devices are supported, but further work with patient advisors should be undertaken to understand some of the key issues highlighted. This will form part of the ongoing work of the Mobilise-D consortium.}

We identify smart water research trends over time, relationships with climate adaptation and mitigation goals, and applicability to places with developed or developing water and electrical infrastructure. To do so, we systematically review the literature, identifying research on Information Communication Technology-enabled technologies related to water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management. We assess the relationship between each study and climate adaptation and mitigation objectives: managing greater variation in water quantity, leading to scarcity and increased stormwater; managing declining water quality; and low-carbon water systems. We find 96 relevant studies and identify five major categories of research addressing climate adaptation and mitigation: monitoring, modeling, system design, system feedbacks, and uptake and implementation. We find there is a recent acceleration in smart water research, with a concentration of studies focused on modeling. There is an emphasis on water efficiency using data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure, which is most applicable to cities with developed water grids and consistent electrical supplies. Secondarily, there is a concentration of work using distributed sensors for early detection of water quality degradation, which is being done in all municipal contexts. There is far less research on uptake and implementation of smart approaches, especially at the institutional level. In addition, there is relatively little work that explicitly relates smart water technologies to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While smart water approaches are applicable everywhere, there is a need to for expanded focus on areas without developed water grids or consistent electricity for smart water to meaningfully contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 6.}

In this paper, the story of Sciences Po Médialab told by Venturini et al. is discussed and completed by demonstrating the incoherence in the choice of digital methods at the Médialab from the actor network theory perspective. As the Médialab mostly used web topologies as structural analysis of social positions, they were not able to account for the propagation of ideas, considered in actor network theory as non-humans that have their own agency. The main arguments in favour of the “more continuous social” developed at the Médialab (quali-quanti, following the actors, zooming) proved to be as misleading as the network metaphor. The distribution of agency that actor network theory so successfully expands was paradoxicallty reduced to structures and individual preferences, to the detriment of the agency of replications that circulate entities in the form of messages, content or memes, and that should now become the next step for actor network theory-style digital methods.}

abstract = {Enacting both clock and event time – ambitemporality – in organizational change is beneficial but contradictory. Prior research establishes that actors valuing the co-existence of both time conceptions enables ambitemporality in change. However, this is likely to be problematic in many organizations because clock time is hegemonic. Clock time not only exerts systemic influences, but its proponents also work to exclude event time perspectives from affecting change. So how does event time influence change in these contexts? I explore, in an ethnography of an organizational change, how the clock–event time dialectic shapes the doing of time in change. The study’s primary contribution is in showing that event time proponents gain power to influence change through two types of political action: uncertainty switching and plasticizing temporal boundaries. A secondary contribution demonstrates the specific features of conflict that enable ambitemporality to emerge despite power asymmetries existing between the contradictory time conceptions.}

It aims to understand how LGBTQ identities and cultures are represented and negotiated through the use of, and shaped by, digital media platforms. Through the textual analysis of 37 LGBTQ-themed Spotify playlists, we identified four cultural logics that structure the practice of playlist curation, each of which demonstrates the significance of music consumption to individual identity work and collective belonging. We conclude that the practice of playlist curation engages with LGBTQ culture in three productive ways: first, the curators contribute to a library of libraries by sharing their diverse perspectives on what constitutes LGBTQ music culture; second, the Spotify platform engages in community-building through enabling the sharing of tastes, pleasures, and experiences; and third, the curation of playlists brings diverse identity politics to the table, resulting in playlists that are politically queer, heteronormative, or ideologically ambiguous.}

Methods Qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 27 Danish patients were conducted over a period of 9 months, from February to October 2020. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis was guided by Nelly Oudshoorn’s concept of technogeography of care. Results The following three themes were identified in the data: VC-home dynamics: balancing boundaries; VC-workplace dynamics: logistical considerations; and VC-body image dynamics: on-screen exposure. Conclusions Taking human geography and science and technology studies as our analytical point of departure, we used the concept of technogeography of care and demonstrated how the reciprocal dynamics between patients’ choice of place and how they experience VC made boundaries fluid and complex between different contexts and places, such as the home, the workplace and the clinic. These boundaries were negotiated differently by the patients depending on their need for privacy, convenience and support. Additionally, VC reconfigured patients’ and general practitioners’ roles, increasing patients’ responsibility in securing an appropriate health care setting.}

Shejian marks a distinctive attribute of China’s contemporary food media, which deploys glamourized food images, from ordinary staple food to lavish celebratory meals, to reify social prosperity and personal happiness. This article aims to demonstrate how despite its state-sponsored production and distribution, Shejian is more than an ideological artefact. The cultural phenomenon has thrived at the intersection of China’s media convergence and participatory culture. On the one side, Shejian’s unprecedented success and influence should be attributed to CCTV’s convergence strategies against the backdrop of media reforms. On the other, audience participation and re-creation on the Internet have invigorated the formation and spread of the Shejian phenomenon while problematizing the official interpretation and ideological construction of the documentary. Shejian’s savvy viewers and cynical imitators poach the florid documentary script to write their versions of reality, albeit disguised with profanity and laughter. How the widespread egao practices play with the establishment culture and how such online expressions are tolerated by the authorities shed new light on China’s Internet culture and censorship.}

In doing so, we firmly place tourism within the concept of a system that relies on a steady flow of money from tourists to function. Three scenarios, each with two end states, to cover the array of potential reactions and recovery from the pandemic are presented.

Representations of skin in consumer culture, including marketing communications, are anything but “blank” backgrounds or “neutral” meaning spaces. We analyse how skin “appears” to work, and how its appearance in consumer culture imagery reveals ideological and pedagogical aspects of skin. Building upon psychodynamic and interdisciplinary understandings of skin, we discuss dimensions of the body that feed marketing communications and branding. We highlight representational fetishization and the epidermal schema as conceptual tools to interrogate the commodification of skin and as constitutive elements in processes of skin commodification. We provide theoretical insights to address the ways in which skin is implicated in new and emerging concerns of digital representational practices.}

We review recent trends and policies to address social protection gaps for multiple jobholders in these countries prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the extent to which the emergence of the “platform economy” can exacerbate multiple jobholding. We conclude that attempts to resolve the gaps in social security protection reflect distinctive characteristics of each employment system.}

The imposed conditionalities induced a deep recession, created an unfathomable challenge for Greece to meet the conditionalities year after year, and resulted in a sequence of failed adjustment programs, one after the other. Scholars, students, and policymakers of the global financial crisis and international development will benefit from these findings because the subject is of current interest and uses Greece as a case study to speak to the ongoing debates about the imposed recession as an antidote to the global financial crisis.

Based on 113 in-depth laddering interviews analyzed using interpretive structural modeling, our study shows that value co-creation mechanisms differ between business-to-business and customer-to-customer digital service types. We identify five mechanisms to support value co-creation in the design of digital services: (1) Social use, (2) Customer orientation and decision making, (3) Service experience, (4) Service use context, and (5) Customer values and goals. We claim that firms can readily utilize these mechanisms to improve their customers’ service experiences.}

abstract = {Customer reviews are a new type of third-party evaluation that has transformed how power operates over evaluated producers, and in so doing has attracted scholarly attention. However, this literature rarely addresses the power relationships operating between platforms collecting and aggregating these reviews. We address this blind spot by relying on Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of fields, which we use to highlight that the reaction of producers to traditional third-party evaluations depend on, and reproduce, the domination of an evaluation intermediary over its competitors. Our qualitative study of the field of jobbing platforms in France reveals that producers react to customer reviews only on platforms accumulating relatively better stocks of reviews, in a self-reinforcing manner. Managers of platforms with smaller stocks of reviews resist by sheltering jobbers from reviews. Our study re-introduces field-level power dynamics between platforms to research exploring the forms of power that operate on producers subjected to reviews. It adds to studies of evaluation intermediaries by specifying that the accumulation of reviews underpins the power relationships between intermediaries in the customer review era and by identifying sheltering as a new form of resistance. Finally, it updates Bourdieu’s theory for the digital age by explaining that individuals’ accumulation of capital online relates to inter-organisational power dynamics.}

We conducted a case study of a large luxury resort hotel to examine how digital platforms (specifically TripAdvisor and WhatsApp) facilitate surveillance. Our findings show how digital platform-facilitated synoptic and panoptic forms of surveillance can suppress workers’ moral impulse and foster moral ambivalence towards such issues as invading others’ privacy, pressuring others outside working hours, and increasing surveillance in the workplace. This paper offers a novel perspective on theorizing the links between digital platforms, surveillance, and workers’ morality and highlights some unintended consequences.}

These innovative scientific applications were the results of a productive convergence in the post-war strategic earth sciences, the details and mechanisms of which were diffused and concealed by elaborate security protocols. With CORONA’s declassification, and prospects for further declassification of Cold War-era archives, a window is opened into the clandestine reconfiguration of the strategic earth sciences and their complex integration with military and intelligence research and applications during the Cold War.}

By reason of their acute temporariness, both short stay workers and occupational trainees could be regarded as having a migration status that makes them vulnerable in their work relations. In addition, this vulnerability means they may accept terms and conditions that undercut domestic labour standards. Although the detailed legislative tracing of both visas reveals various attempts to re-regulate both visas in favour of greater scrutiny of employer requests for overseas labour, tightening access requirements and increasing enforcement and monitoring capacity, these have been largely incapable of preventing instances of egregious exploitation. These case studies on two little-known visas mirror the growing concerns around the integrity of Australia’s temporary labour migration program more generally and point to the myriad tensions, challenges and complexities inherent in the regulation of temporary labour migration programs around the globe.}

abstract = {The Internet has evolved into a ubiquitous and indispensable digital environment in which people communicate, seek information, and make decisions. Despite offering various benefits, online environments are also replete with smart, highly adaptive choice architectures designed primarily to maximize commercial interests, capture and sustain users’ attention, monetize user data, and predict and influence future behavior. This online landscape holds multiple negative consequences for society, such as a decline in human autonomy, rising incivility in online conversation, the facilitation of political extremism, and the spread of disinformation. Benevolent choice architects working with regulators may curb the worst excesses of manipulative choice architectures, yet the strategic advantages, resources, and data remain with commercial players. One way to address some of this imbalance is with interventions that empower Internet users to gain some control over their digital environments, in part by boosting their information literacy and their cognitive resistance to manipulation. Our goal is to present a conceptual map of interventions that are based on insights from psychological science. We begin by systematically outlining how online and offline environments differ despite being increasingly inextricable. We then identify four major types of challenges that users encounter in online environments: persuasive and manipulative choice architectures, AI-assisted information architectures, false and misleading information, and distracting environments. Next, we turn to how psychological science can inform interventions to counteract these challenges of the digital world. After distinguishing among three types of behavioral and cognitive interventions—nudges, technocognition, and boosts—we focus on boosts, of which we identify two main groups: (a) those aimed at enhancing people’s agency in their digital environments (e.g., self-nudging, deliberate ignorance) and (b) those aimed at boosting competencies of reasoning and resilience to manipulation (e.g., simple decision aids, inoculation). These cognitive tools are designed to foster the civility of online discourse and protect reason and human autonomy against manipulative choice architectures, attention-grabbing techniques, and the spread of false information.}

As the legitimacy and value of the “war on drugs” has increasingly become a topic of public discussion, how such debates are shaped by both media communication and contemporary racial discourses warrants rigorous sociological analysis. In this article, we use a content analysis of newspaper manuscripts and online comments on “war on drugs” news stories to examine (1) the racial discourse within mass media agenda-setting and framing and (2) patterns of discursive identity construction in the context of digital and mass-mediated social commentary. Our findings show how “racial silence,” implicit and explicit racial discourse, and identity construction via racialized subject-positions assist to rationalize and legitimate racial inequality. We also outline the theoretical implications of these findings and avenues of future research.}

What is of particular relevance is their opinions and beliefs about the proper order of society and the societal role of tech firms – that is to say, their political ideologies. The few existing studies on this topic mainly concentrate on tech leaders. Our study shifts attention to the workers who develop the technology. Numerous works highlight their influence on the affordances of technology and decisions taken by their firms. Our quantitative analysis of campaign contributions shows that American tech workers exhibit a unique combination of left-wing (liberal) and anti-establishment attitudes. Moreover, we expose a substantial ideological divide between tech workers and their leaders. We discuss these findings in relation to the development of new technologies, employee activism, and tech workers as a distinct class fraction.}

Using five animated television advertisements for Hilton Hotels made by German animator Raimund Krumme, the essay raises some of the paradoxes inherent in the single, two-dimensional, animated graphic line as both an abstract geometric construct and an eccentric visualization of energy and entropy. What Krumme’s animations emphasize (even if in the service of an advertising campaign) is that, never a `thing’, the line in motion intends and marks its own differánce and is always more lived and contingent than its geometry would suggest.}

abstract = {This article explores the transformative effects of augmented reality mobile games on society and space. By layering playfulness onto public space through a digital interface, augmented reality mobile games create a pervasive sense of play that can be accessed by players potentially anywhere, and at any time. Games like these can therefore be understood as heterotopic inscriptions on otherwise mundane environments. Since being released in 2016, Pokémon Go has become one of the most popular augmented reality games in the world. It gamifies place by embedding digital objects within public spaces; in doing so, it can bring about a reimagination of publicness by incentivising players to engage with places – and with each other – in ways that are structured by the competitive logics of play. Through an empirical examination of the playing of Pokémon Go in Singapore, I consider how the game gives rise to new modalities of emplaced meaning, new ways of navigating the city and increasingly public performances of private play. To conclude, I argue that research should continue to explore the gamifying effects of digital technologies on everyday life.}

Besides collective bargaining, the training and activation of works councillors is the trade unions’ most important sphere of activity. Through their involvement in the “Arbeit 2020” project analysed in this article, three industrial unions have been attempting to find answers to the question of how Industry 4.0 will be shaped on the shop floor. With the assistance of publicly funded external consultants and the involvement of the workforce, the change processes in selected plants were investigated. In a number of them, agreements on the future shaping of digital change were successfully concluded. The project was devised as an experiment, since the very diverse situations in the various plants meant it was impossible for outsiders to go in with fixed specifications for the shaping of change. The largest of the unions involved, IG Metall, intends to use these experiences in the next two years as the basis for training 1000 full-time and voluntary officials to act as “promoters of change” in the workplace.}

Although a large body of research on pay information exists, on topics ranging from pay transparency to pay secrecy, researchers have used inconsistent definitions (pay secrecy, openness, transparency, pay communications) and operationalizations that hinder knowledge development. In this paper, consistent with the theory of information asymmetry and based on research reviewed here, we promote a new integrative definition (“pay information disclosure”) that anchors both current and future research. We define the concept of pay information disclosure (PID) as the communication of relevant pay information between and among actors. By viewing pay information disclosure research in an information asymmetry context, with its focus on the causes and consequences of unequal access to information, we can synthesize research that examines motives for and outcomes of PID for individuals, organizations, and society. Based on our review, we outline a research agenda that identifies research questions and methods to stimulate studies to better understand the role of pay information in the workplace and in society.}

Against this background, the article attempts to demonstrate that the vagueness and ambiguity associated with its meaning may make fairness particularly attractive to policy makers and that, accordingly, the revival of fairness risks being simply functional to grant them more discretion and room for intervention.

Self-publishers invest in and make decisions to publish their creative goods without the involvement of an established and external production company or publishing house. In creative industries, claims are made about the inferior quality of self-published works, creating a stigma for self-publishing. This article investigates the ways in which aspiring writers who are considering self-publishing, handle the tension between their aspiration to publish a book and the possible stigma of self-publishing. The study draws on an analysis of interviews with 59 writers who are considering self-publishing as an option or who have self-published a book. The aspiring writers are aware of the subordinate status of such publications and while some avoid self-publishing, others seek ways to establish and legitimise the quality of their work to avoid the stigma. Legitimisation is produced through the perception of a transitioning author role and by shifting the basis of evaluation of publishability to the consumer side in creative industries, to non-professional judgement, and to the experience of being published. The outcome of the decision to self-publish, and the underpinning culture for making such assessments, has consequences for how books and other cultural goods are currently produced and the type of cultural goods that reach consumers. The assessment of self-publishing as an option among writers exposes tensions and transformations in the evaluation of cultural goods in contemporary creative industries.}

These partnerships are motivated by ideals of alignment as stakeholders strive to find the “sweet spot” between humanitarian and business interests. However, this article shows that the ideals of alignment differ from the actual practices of alignment in the CSPs, and sweet spots are not merely found but constructed in and through changing relations of power. Based on an ethnographic case study of partnerships between a global humanitarian organization and five technology companies, the article deploys a theoretical lens from critical humanitarian studies to analyze how alignment in CSPs comes about in practice. This analysis demonstrates that in the construction of alignment, the companies’ interests become the priorities with which humanitarian organizations must align their and their beneficiaries’ needs. Consequently, while the discourse of sweet spots perpetuates an ideal of alignment where all partners benefit equally from the partnership, it legitimates power imbalances and asymmetrical alignment in practice.}

The research reported here takes from cognitive psychology and information processing the concept of a “schema” which organizes and structures those stimuli in varying ways and to varying degrees. Utilizing various measures of stimulus recall and recognition, it compares the reaction to political and non-political stimuli of persons putatively possessing a well-developed political schema (“politicos”) and those lacking such a schema (“apoliticals”). The results suggest that the concept offers a promising approach for research on problems of political perception and response.}

Yet, the question of how formal managers can support street-level workers’ performance and well-being remains underexplored. Building on insights from the street-level and generic leadership literatures, the authors seek to delineate a role for formal managers that takes seriously the particularities of the street-level context. The authors develop a concept of street-level leadership that is underpinned by a relational approach and focused on activating street-level workers’ professional knowledge and building supportive communities, with the purpose of supporting professional uses of discretion, conscientious prioritizations, and the ability to handle moral dilemmas and emotional strain. Empirical examples illustrate street-level leadership in practice. Future research should explore the proposed mechanisms and effects of street-level leadership, including important HRM outcomes such as job satisfaction, retention, and burnout.}

Currently, a clinician will likely shoulder liability via a negligence claim for allowing defects in an AIS’s outputs to reach patients. We question if this is “fair, just and reasonable” to clinical users: we argue that a duty of care to patients ought to be recognised on the part of SDCs as well as clinicians. As an alternative to negligence claims, we propose “risk pooling” which utilises insurance. Here, a fairer construct of shared responsibility for AIS use could be created between the clinician and the SDC; thus, allowing a rapid mechanism of compensation to injured patients via insurance.}

The study identifies three fundamental phases in the development of Italian digital journalism: the birth of the first online newsrooms; the spread of social media; and the data/platform turn. The article applies a new institutionalism discursive approach to investigate the impact of macro-level forces on micro-level journalists’ accounts. For this purpose, it considers excerpts from interviews in which journalists talk about change and professional jurisdiction. The following three main results emerge. 1. Political parallelism and resistance to technology have ceased to be the most prevalent features of Italian journalism; 2. In the first two periods identified, the clash of discourses is more oriented to identifying practices that may be identified as “journalism” (e.g. the newcomer is a journalist who does the job differently). (C) Much of what is regarded as an uncertainty has been incorporated over time and no longer appears to be a threat, but awareness of the power of online platforms is growing.}

On the one hand, workers can move physically from one Member State to another for a short or long stay, while, on the other hand, virtual migration is rising. Partly due to globalisation and the Covid-19 pandemic, cross-border telework – which can take place anytime and anywhere – has become an integral part of society. Whereas the social security and tax laws applicable to these cross-border teleworkers have been researched extensively, the applicable labour law, following the Rome I-Regulation and the Posting of Workers Directive, remains unclear. The same is true regarding the qualification of such cross-border teleworkers as posted workers under the free movement of services. Indeed, these legal frameworks include a general approach without prescribing specific connecting factors or conditions of application tailored to the virtuality of cross-border teleworkers. Consequently, this contribution examines the labour law applicable to cross-border teleworkers within the EU and the (un)surmountable bottlenecks that arise in applying the legal frameworks currently in place.}

Providing incentives and the necessary research structure to coordinate all sectors and organizations concerned with water is also essential.}

abstract = {Self-organisation in robot swarms can produce collective behaviours, particularly through spatial self-organisation. For example, it can be used to ensure that the robots in a swarm move collectively. However, from a designer’s point of view, understanding precisely what happens in a swarm that allows these behaviours to emerge at the macroscopic level remains a difficult task. The same behaviour can come from multiple different controllers (ie the control algorithm of a robot) and a single controller can give rise to multiple different behaviours, sometimes caused by slight changes in self-organisation. To grasp the causes of these differences, it is necessary to investigate the relationships between the many methods of self-organisation that exist and the various behaviours that can be obtained. The work presented here addresses self-organisation in robot swarms by focusing on the main behaviours that lead to spatial self-organisation of the robots. First, we propose a unified definition of the different behaviours and present an original classification system highlighting ten self-organisation methods that each allow one or more behaviours to be performed. An analysis, based on this classification system, links the identified mechanisms with behaviours that could be considered as obtainable or not. Finally, we discuss some perspectives on this work, notably from the point of view of an operator or designer.}

abstract = {Agile working (flexibility about where and when practitioners do their work) is increasingly common across public sector social work, but there has been little research about how practitioners engage with it or its impacts on communication between social workers, their colleagues and the families with whom they work. This article presents findings from an ethnographic study of a children’s safeguarding social work team in an English local authority who were engaged in agile working. It draws on data from observations, local authority documents, semi-structured interviews, participant research diaries, participants’ photographs and the researcher’s photographs taken during fieldwork. An analytical frame drawing on Henri Lefebvre’s concept of spatial dialectics and Wanda Orlikowski’s concept of sociomateriality is used to identify how agile working involves entanglements of practitioners and families with restructured office spaces, digital information systems and mobile devices such as convertible laptop–tablet computers and mobile phones. Innovations such as these are commonly understood as promoting more effective and transparent social work practice, but the study’s data show that entanglements between workspaces, digital devices and people in practice are having multiple effects, producing new hierarchies of belonging in space, shaping what can be communicated, and the ways it can be presented and received. The article argues for critical attention to the role of material space in digital and place-based innovations in social work practice.}

abstract = {Metahuman systems are new, emergent, sociotechnical systems where machines that learn join human learning and create original systemic capabilities. Metahuman systems will change many facets of the way we think about organizations and work. They will push information systems research in new directions that may involve a revision of the field’s research goals, methods and theorizing. Information systems researchers can look beyond the capabilities and constraints of human learning toward hybrid human/machine learning systems that exhibit major differences in scale, scope and speed. We review how these changes influence organization design and goals. We identify four organizational level generic functions critical to organize metahuman systems properly: delegating, monitoring, cultivating, and reflecting. We show how each function raises new research questions for the field. We conclude by noting that improved understanding of metahuman systems will primarily come from learning-by-doing as information systems scholars try out new forms of hybrid learning in multiple settings to generate novel, generalizable, impactful designs. Such trials will result in improved understanding of metahuman systems. This need for large-scale experimentation will push many scholars out from their comfort zone, because it calls for the revitalization of action research programs that informed the first wave of socio-technical research at the dawn of automating work systems.}

abstract = {This article aims to determine whether mobile payments can be characterized by a legal constant, or common legal meaning. Indeed, mobile payments are a new form of payment system that is shaping the new economy of financial markets. Generally, they are part of the Fintech phenomenon, and they are specifically regulated in Europe, inter alia, under the Payment System Directive and the Regulation on Multilateral Interchange Fees. Nonetheless, those secondary hard law acts do not include any compulsory legal definition for mobile payments, which remain undefined and conventionally identified as means of proximity or remote payments. With that in mind, the article introduces for the first time in comparative law a new concept that aims at discovering meanings rather than similarities and differences that are irremediably limited to a merely descriptive function. To this end, the article argues that each time the constant outside of the law is subsequently recognized as “legal”, it becomes a legal constant, which is in turn capable of effectively revolutionizing the same study of mobile payments as well as of comparative law tout court.}

By drawing on science and technology studies, public administration studies, and socio-legal studies we analyze law in the making and identify four imaginaries of public digital administration: understandable administration, self-monitoring administration, adaptive administration, and responsible administration. We argue that digital administration is seen from the perspective of public authorities serving their current needs of legitimizing existing automation practices. While technology is pictured as unproblematic, the citizen perspective is missing. We conclude that the absence of an in-depth understanding of the diverse needs of citizens raises the question whether the relationship between public power and citizens is becoming a one-way street despite of the public administration ideals that express values of citizen engagement.}

Debord’s arguments about appearance, visibility and celebrity are echoed in the way organizations increasingly focus on their brand, image, impression, and reputation. Yet, the role of spectacles in organizational life has remained under-researched in organization studies. As the boundaries between fact and fiction, reality and representation, substance and appearance become increasingly blurred, questions about the production and effects of spectacles seem more pertinent than ever. Are representations faithful mirrors of reality, or attempts to conceal reality? Do they replace reality, or bring new realities into being? By articulating three possible understandings of the spectacle, as fetishism, hyper-reality or performativity, this essay invites organization scholars to examine the organization of the real and the making of organizations through processes of spectacular representation including discursive practices, visual images and theatrical performances.}

We also reveal how such “false balance” sustains and legitimizes organizational activity by displacing responsibilities onto distant “others” through temporal (futurizing), spatial (externalizing) and level (magnifying / individualizing) rhetorical devices. In revealing the process of paradox construction and resolution as “balance” in the context of digitalization and its unanticipated outcomes, we join conversations into new organizational responsibilities in the digital economy, with implications for theory and practice.}

Between March 15 and December 31, 2020, across sites for which data are available, 65 percent fewer eviction cases were filed than would be expected in a typical year. Extrapolating nationwide, the authors estimate that at least 1.55 million fewer eviction cases were filed in 2020 than in a normal year. The pace at which cases were filed increased in late 2020, however, and the amount of back rent claimed grew considerably. Filing rates exceeded historical averages when protections lapsed.

It conceptualizes the theoretical impact of social investment on long-term care policy and analyzes its use to justify reforms since the early 2000s. It concludes that social investment has not played any role in Dutch long-term care reforms and a moderate role in France. Meanwhile, in both countries a neoliberal emphasis on the efficiency of the market has contributed to a rise in for-profit service provision and fragmentation of the long-term care sector. While long-term care provision in both countries proved relatively resilient in the first phase of the pandemic, at a later stage its resilience was undermined by fragmentation and marketization, limiting the government’s ability to respond adequately to new challenges and, crucially, to improve working conditions in the sector. The article concludes that a social investment approach cannot resolve these problems and that there is a need for a new paradigm that acknowledges the inherent value of care work and prioritizes the long-term sustainability of care provision.}

I find that agency relationships in the collaborative communities are characterized by three distinct multiple-agency structures: commons, team production, and brokering. These are governed by four main categories of mechanism: (1) mutual monitoring, enabling self-regulation and peer-based control; (2) membership restrictions, regulating admission to the community; (3) values and rules, guiding member action and collaboration; and (4) property rights and incentives, regulating rights to community resources and distribution of rewards.

Drawing upon trends in accounting practice and research I develop a number of inflection points which define theoretical tensions between the concepts of audit society and surveillance capitalism. These tensions suggest that theoretical innovation is required in the face of: the accelerating constitution of organizations by platforms and their processes – “platformization”; the constitution of human agents as data-driven subjects of these data architectures – “cyborgization”; and the reconstruction of the social sciences by a pervasive data positivism in which accounting becomes “accountics”. The exploration of these three inflection points reveals the deep operational logic of surveillance capitalism as an “economy of traces” and traceability. Zuboff’s challenge of a political dystopia governed by technology giants and Flyverbom’s image of a society “overlit” by digital architectures necessitate a re-specification of the audit society dynamics that I have previously theorized. The re-specification that I propose in this essay is a form of a critical “traceology” which takes as its focus the ongoing production of all manner of traces and how they make up organizations, people and forms of knowledge.}

Such a situation has been exacerbated in the past two years by the Covid-19 pandemic. This has led to an increase in the leverage of digitalisation, which has proved to be a crucial tool for the development and application of new organisational models at both hospital and territorial levels, thus addressing the various criticalities already present in the system. In this sense, the Virtual Hospital has emerged as a potential model for increasing effectiveness and efficiency in delivering sociomedical services. Starting from these premises, an EFTE (estimate, feedback, talk, estimate) approach was used to acquire an expert consensus within a multidisciplinary panel of academics and healthcare managers of the Veneto Region in Italy. This article reports the expert opinion on the possible application of the Virtual Hospital model in the national context, starting from the existing international evidence and good practices, highlighting the potential advantages and barriers to its implementation.

To achieve our goal, two robust review protocols (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context (PICOC) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)) were used to systematically analyze 62 documents extracted from the Web of Science database to identify the main techniques and tools for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) as applied to SWM and explore the technological potential to optimize the stages of collecting and transporting waste. Moreover, it was possible to analyze the main challenges and opportunities of KDD and DM for SWM. The results show that the most used tools for SWM are MATLAB (29.7%) and GIS (13.5%), whereas the most used techniques are Artificial Neural Networks (35.8%), Linear Regression (16.0%) and Support Vector Machine (12.3%). In addition, 15.3% of the studies were conducted with data from China, 11.1% from India and 9.7% of the studies analyzed and compared data from several other countries. Furthermore, the research showed that the main challenges in the field of study are related to the collection and treatment of data, whereas the opportunities appear to be linked mainly to the impact on the pillars of sustainable development. Thus, this study portrays important issues associated with the use of KDD and DM for optimal SWM and has the potential to assist and direct researchers and field professionals in future studies.}

Such differences can lead to digital inequalities. In higher education digital inequalities among students are scarcely researched as it is assumed that university students possess crucial digital competencies which they have acquired at school and in everyday life through the use of digital devices and applications. However, research findings suggest that students cannot directly transfer their digital skills to their study situation. The presented study aims to measure the degree of digitalisation by means of an index, the DDS-Index, which was developed in the context of a large-scale survey among first-semester students in Austria (n=4,822). The DDS-Index maps the degree of digitalisation of students on a range of 0 to 100 points. This paper outlines the development and assessment of the DDS-Index and uses it to analyse differences in the degree of digitalisation of students in order to draw conclusions about a digital divide at universities.}

abstract = {As the key to digital transformation, artificial intelligence is believed to help achieve the goal of government as a platform and the agile development of digital services. Yet we know little about its potential role in local governance, especially the advances that AI-supported services for the public sector in local governance have ventured and the public value they have created. Combining the digital transformation concepts and public value theory, we fill the gap by examining artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in the public sector of a pilot city of digital transformation in China. Using a mixed-method approach, we show how AI configurations facilitate public value creation in the digital era and identify four dimensions of AI deployment in the public sector: data integration, policy innovation, smart application, and collaboration. Our case analysis on these four dimensions demonstrates two roles that AI technology plays in local governance—“AI cage” and “AI colleague.” The former builds the technology infrastructure and platform in each stage of service delivery, regulating the behaviors of frontline workers, while the latter helps frontline workers make decisions, thus improving the agility of public service provision.}

abstract = {This study explores the news framing of A.I., China, and the U.S.A. in two mainstream news outlets: The Washington Post and The South China Morning Post. The main objective is to analyse how both, as parts of different discourse cultures, portray the competition for leadership in A.I. innovation between China and the U.S.A. The study takes a critical look at the media discourse on the “new arms race” and what role the news play in localising global technology trends. The empirical part makes use of a combination of manual and automated content analyses. To this end, a dictionary approach that utilises Names Entity Recognition was applied to a large volume of news texts (N = 3.055) to identify recurring news frames. The findings show similarities in the perception of A.I.’s potentials and versatility but also clear cultural differences in how risks and conflicts are portrayed in both outlets. Although the Washington Post appears more critical about A.I., the South China Morning Post frames the technology as a driver of economic growth and global influence. The discussion offers a starting point for theorising the relationship between mediatisation, tech trends, cultural differences, and international politics.}

Objective: To examine the needs, privacy expectations and concerns of patients, family members, patient advocates and clinicians in relation to the use of networked EMRs for clinical genetic information. Method: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 27 participants for a semi-structured qualitative interview, primarily over Zoom. The interviews were audio and video-recorded and externally transcribed. Interview transcripts were then coded and analysed in NVivo, using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Thematic analysis revealed diverse preferences regarding genetic information access and handling across participants, with five core themes being identified: degree of access and control; central role of genetic professionals as information gatekeepers; complexities of familial implications; external risks; and law, governance and policy; all strong themes that emerged across numerous participants. Conclusion: This project yielded unprecedented and significant insights into the views, needs and concerns of key stakeholders in Australia regarding the inclusion of health-related genetic test results in networked EMRs. Implications: These findings provide a critical reference point for much-needed law reform and policy-making around genetic test results in Australia.}

In our analysis, we will argue that the gaps and discrepancies in the field of digitalization of public administration, correlated with the indicators monitored in the Digital Economy and Society Index, have conditioned the EU Member States to design specific actions, measures and investments related to the national context. Points for practitioners The gaps and discrepancies concerning the digitalization of public administration are analyzed and evaluated in relation to the state-of-play of digital transformation of public administration in EU Member States, correlated with the objectives and funding allocated to the digitalization pillar of the NRRP. The digitalization gap is measured by identifying and evaluating quantifiable indicators.

abstract = {This article develops a new theoretical approach to digitalisation in diplomacy, resituating conventional understandings of the relationship between diplomacy and technological transformation. Challenging the conception that “traditional” diplomacy is being supplemented or challenged by new forms of “digital diplomacy”, we show how the ubiquity of digital devices and technologies makes disentangling analogue from digital diplomatic practices practically impossible today. The argument is developed through ethnographic observations of everyday diplomatic work in the European Union (EU) multilateral setting in Brussels as well as interviews with ambassadors, attachés, seconded diplomats, spokespersons and interpreters. To understand the place of digital technologies in diplomatic work, we develop the concept of blended diplomacy by which we mean the dual process of the entanglement of technical and social doings and the contestation regarding how this entanglement impacts professional diplomatic imaginaries and relations. Drawing on insights from practice theory and the sociology of science, technology and professions, we show how diplomatic actors demarcate their professional territory and protect their positions through boundary work. They draw horizontal boundaries between what they see as “real” diplomatic work and distractions and vertical boundaries between themselves and other diplomatic actors, ranking people around status and skills. Overall, digital technologies are implicated in deeper struggles regarding what it means to be a diplomat. A focus on the blended character of diplomatic practice opens new avenues for research on how digitalisation, in contradictory and uneven ways, shapes norms, identities, and social relations and how it – through reflexivity, anxieties and contestation – may shape international politics.}

We found that misaligned innovations are aligned through a process of task sequence alignment, knowledge base alignment, and work allocation alignment. Our findings are important; they suggest that implementing systemic innovations in project networks is a multistage inter-firm process.}

We articulate this approach as the hierarchy-of-parts architecture and explain how it emphasizes decomposition of a design into loosely coupled parts and subsequent aggregation of these into an industrial product. To realize the scale benefits of modularity, firms successively freeze design specifications before production and therefore only allow limited windows of functionality design and redesign. This makes it difficult to take advantage of the increased speed by which digitized products can be developed and modified. To address this problem, we draw on Christopher Alexander’s notion of design patterns to introduce a complementary approach to manage technological change that is resilient to digital technology. We articulate this approach as the network-of-patterns architecture and explain how it emphasizes generalization of ideas into patterns and subsequent specialization of patterns for different design purposes. In response to the increased digitization of industrial products, we demonstrate the value of complementing hierarchy-of-parts thinking with network-of-patterns thinking through a case study of infotainment architecture at an automaker. As a result, we contribute to the literature on managing products in the digital age: we highlight the properties of digital technology that increase the speed by which digitized products can be redesigned; we offer the notion of architectural frames and propose hierarchy-of-parts and network-of-patterns as frames to support innovation of digitized products; and, we outline an agenda for future research that reconsiders the work of Simon and Alexander as well as their followers to address key challenges in innovating digitized products.}

Such digital connectivity gives rise to the important phenomenon of behavioral visibility. We argue that studying the antecedents, processes, and consequences of behavioral visibility should be a central concern for scholars of organizing. We attempt to set the cornerstones for the study of behavioral visibility by considering the social and technological contexts that are enabling behavioral visibility, developing the concept of behavioral visibility by defining its various components, considering the conditions through which it is commonly produced, and outlining potential consequences of behavioral visibility in the form of three paradoxes. We conclude with some conjectures about the kinds of research questions, empirical foci, and methodological strategies that scholars will need to embrace in order to understand how behavioral visibility shapes and is shaped by the process of organizing as we catapult, swiftly, into an era where artificial intelligence, learning algorithms, and social tools are changing the way people work.}

IIs are recursively composed of other infrastructures, platforms, applications and IT capabilities and controlled by emergent, distributed and episodic forms of control. II’s evolutionary dynamics are nonlinear, path dependent and influenced by network effects and unbounded user and designer learning. The proposed theory tackles tensions between two design problems related to the II design: (1) the bootstrap problem: IIs need to meet directly early users’ needs in order to be initiated; and (2) the adaptability problem: local designs need to recognize II’s unbounded scale and functional uncertainty. We draw upon Complex Adaptive Systems theory to derive II design rules that address the bootstrap problem by generating early growth through simplicity and usefulness, and the adaptability problem by promoting modular and generative designs. We illustrate these principles by analyzing the history of Internet exegesis.}

I develop the concept of “platform architecture” to examine the technological, legal, and organizational aspects of control and management in the labor process and the variable relationships between them. Analyzing 68 in-depth interviews, ethnographic data, and 87 cases of strikes and protests, I compare the platform architecture of service and gig platforms and examine the relationship between their respective architecture and labor contention. I argue that specific differences in platform architecture diffuse or heighten collective contention. Within the service platform, technological control and management generates work dissatisfaction, but the legal and organizational dimensions contain grievances and reduce the appeal of, and spaces for, collective contention. Conversely, within the gig platform, all three dimensions of platform architecture reinforce one another, escalating grievances, enhancing the appeal of collective contention, and providing spaces for mobilizing solidarity and collective action. As a result, gig platform couriers are more likely to consider their work relations exploitative and to mobilize contention, despite facing higher barriers to collective action due to the atomization of their work.}

A measuring sequence involves object and clear field scans, and the final readout is virtually independent of fluctuations and heterogeneities in illumination and of variations in the size of the scanning apertures. Optical sources of error are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally as they apply to scanning cytophotometers. The effects of conical and polychromatic illumination, stray light and heterogeneous distribution of chromophore lead to negative averaging errors that are a function of optical density. The role of scan aperture size and optical resolution on distributional error is discussed and calculated in terms of three possible models. Non-absorptive phenomena, such as scattering and diffraction, lead to positive errors that are complementary, in a qualitative sense, to distributional error. In attempting to isolate these different errors experimentally, we show that measurements of the relative deoxyribonucleic acid stain content of human leukocytes are independent, within wide limits, of condenser and objective numerical aperture and of changes in absorptivity secondary to changes in wavelength. Where an adequate theory exists, these experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions and, in any case, they indicate that for stained leukocytes the net effect of all optical errors must be less than 2%. Random measuring errors include both photon shot noise and errors associated with the geometry of the scanning disc. These errors contribute to an error of 1.2% among replicate measurements of leukocytes made under standard conditions. The previously reported differences in stain content among leukocyte types and among individual cells within types cannot be ascribed to either optical or instrumentation errors. Thus, the measured differences must reflect actual differences either in the amount or in the absorptivity of the stain.}

Semi-legible visual evidence can take many forms, including blurry photographs; low-quality films shot by police dashboard cameras, surveillance cameras, or iphones; fingerprints; x-rays; MRIs and PET scans, to name just a few of the many types of visual display introduced in court that are only partly decipherable to a (lay) viewer. Semi-legible images cannot be said simply to speak for themselves; they must be made to speak, through the exertion of effort, expertise, or both. I argue that thinking about these different kinds of visual evidence together has the effect, not only of highlighting semi-legibility as a meaningful evidentiary category, but also of suggesting important but often-unnoticed connections between expertise and visual legibility. In addition, this essay offers a basic taxonomy of semi-legible visual evidence, examining, in turn, blurry images; interpretively ambiguous images; “jigsaw” images, in which an important piece is missing; images semi-legible to laypeople but readily decipherable by those with relevant expertise; and images semi-legible even to experts. For each category, I describe its parameters, focus on strategies by which it may be made more (or less) legible, and discuss particular challenges it offers as evidence. This essay thus aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex methods by which we produce, wield, enhance, read and interpret visual evidence in court.}

This essay tries to unpack the logic of cinematic cyberphobia in an era in which the film industry has consistently appropriated digital technologies for both production and promotional purposes. Cyberphobic films rehearse cultural myths that interactive media are intrusive and disruptive, thus providing an outlet for dissent (not to mention paranoia) regarding the institutionalisation of new media. However, cyberphobia can also be understood as a defence mechanism against the challenge to cinema’s individuating spectator address that interactive media represent. The article reads films from The Lawnmower Man (1992) to The Truman Show (1998) as allegories of contemporary Hollywood’s dialectical struggle to define itself: cyberphobia denies cinema’s contamination by interactive technologies, while its engagement with digital myths displays interactive media’s fading chance to engender alternative media publics, and recalls cinema’s own early history as a distracted, emphatically public experience.}

abstract = {Since economic analysis of the workings of the online economy is in its early stages, detecting anticompetitive behavior remains challenging. There have been some insights from models that explain how two-sided markets work, but the practical uses of these models are limited thus far. More research is necessary on the definition and operations of platforms of different sizes and with different objectives, for example, the identification of data clustering and flows related to product clustering and information production and the relationships between data, information, and innovation. Furthermore, corporate culture, which can produce cultural clashes within an organization, may influence both (anti)competitive behavior and innovation. The cultural issue becomes even more complex when evaluating whether a merger would result in both innovation and the abuse of market power. This paper develops an overview of the technology and operations of the online economy as a start toward informing competition and antitrust policy. We present a technical overview that becomes a starting point for understanding potential areas of excessive market power. We also examine market dynamics from the large platforms’ points of view to understand where they believe the online economy is heading.}

abstract = {Within academia, as in other corporatized environments, there are irreconcilable tensions embedded in the managerial data imaginary, in contrast to the messy reality of lived experience and increasingly precarious working conditions for those at the coalface of Higher Education. Combined with student debt and escalating surveillance via so-called “artificially intelligent” transactional data analysis, fantasies of control and domination converge on platitudes about Big Data and computational information, often presented as unambiguously neutral via idealized visualizations and “dashboards” such as those commonly provided by Tableau and Google. As a structure, the digital archive is no different, open to fantasies of secure representation but, in fact, always unstable, subject to the materiality and flux of electronic, symbolic and social processes. As academics exposed to intensified metricization within increasingly data driven institutions, how can we counter the reduction of our qualitative research and experience to dashboards and scores? Drawing upon the work of Fleming’s Dark Academia: How Universities Die (2021), Poster’s The Mode of Information (1990), Cascella’s En Abime: Listening, Reading, Writing: An Archival Fiction (2012) and Bayne et al.’s The Manifesto for Teaching Online (2020) among others, and focusing on work developed by the authors from 2008 onwards, they discuss their contingent, often nauseating virtual reality information repository, the Riverine Archive, developed to hold and withhold information about their writing and art within the ugly hulk of what they define as a “neoliberal ship of fools”. The work seeks to offer a counter to prevailing platitudes and fantasies about the neutrality and realism of data to directly represent a stable, singular reality. The authors concur that information is not beautiful, but rather a fallacy of stability, servicing a rapacious, anti-academic neoliberal ideology that needs to be brought to the surface and subjected to honest discourse, away from hype and managerial wishful thinking. Truth and beauty cannot be framed as stable, monolithic or universal; to do so is to replicate a colonial projection of knowledge, a mono-logic, centring all truth upon the Global North.}

abstract = {Today, social networks are the most popular and widely used applications among smartphone users all around the world. Three years ago, the Telegram messaging app was the most widely used social messaging app in Iran due to its technical features and user-friendliness. Despite its popularity, Telegram caused controversial debates among policymakers and public opinion. To discover the nature of these conflicts, two main discourses were identified through qualitative data analysis based on Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory. Proponents of Minaret discourse consider the Telegram as a threat to national security, thus they have tried to provide favorable condition to limit using it, and develop alternative domestic apps. In contrast, Cylinder discourse supports using the Telegram app to fulfill citizens’ digital rights and their rights of privacy and freedom of expression. This discursive conflict among policymakers, along with users’ resistance, resulted in some failures in the adoption of foreign apps (e.g., Telegram). Despite the extensive technical, financial, and moral supports to popularize domestic apps, users still prefer foreign apps such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The analysis of emergent discourses demonstrates the origins of contestations and provides insights into how to adopt social messaging apps.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a key technology for service transformation, that is, the transition from pure product sales to so-called “bundles” of customer-focused combinations of products and services. These combinations are termed product-service systems. They aim to add value for the customer. However, the role of IoT in this context is not quite clear. In this contribution, therefore, we examine the role of IoT in the context of service transformation. Our structured analysis of transformation processes reveals IoT as essential enabler of digital service transformation. We explain IoT-relevance on a strategic and operational level of IoT-capable business models. IoT not only can supplement a portfolio of products on a strategic level, but also completely replace a product. At the operational level, capabilities such as remote monitoring or remote control play a crucial role. IoT also plays a crucial enabling role when the convergence between service transformation and Industry 4.0 is targeted. However, when realizing service transformation, the various IoT capabilities are mutually dependent. Hence, implementation follows in some way a waterfall-like process in which certain results are required to trigger the next development step. We describe these dependencies, and thus facilitate decision making when IoT is used for service transformation processes. Organizations can then take appropriate development actions.}

Early identification of depression results in improved outcomes, but little information is available comprehensively describing depressive symptoms specific to this population. The aim of this study was to develop a taxonomy of depressive symptoms that were manifested and described by young people based on a scoping review and content analysis. Twenty-five journal articles that included narrative descriptions of depressive symptoms in young people were included. A total of 60 depressive symptoms were identified and categorized into five dimensions: behavioral (n = 8), cognitive (n = 14), emotional (n = 15), interpersonal (n = 13), and somatic (n = 10). This comprehensive depression symptom taxonomy can help school nurses to identify young people who may experience depression and will support future research to better screen for depression.}

This research measures the digitalization of the economy and society in cities of China based on Internet-related indicators and digital financial development and investigates the economic and environmental effects of their digitalization. The empirical results show that digitalization has significantly improved green economic efficiency (GEE), and this finding remains valid after a series of robust analyses. However, there is regional heterogeneity in the improvement effect of GEE. The green effect of digitalization is significant only in the cities with a high degree of economic servitization, capital-abundant cities, and eastern cities. Although digitalization has promoted the green development of the urban economy, it also has a negative spatial spillover effect on the GEE of neighboring cities. One explanation is that cities are shifting polluting industries to other areas during the process of digital transformation.}

Although workcation travel displays unique experiential characteristics compared with traditional travel experiences, conceptual and empirical knowledge on the nature and dimensional structure of such experiences is lacking. To fill this gap, this research conceptualizes workcation travel experiences and develops a multi-dimensional scale to measure the degree of such experiences. Based on the analysis of qualitative interviews, four workcation travel experience dimensions are identified: relaxing, improvised, autonomous, and localized experiences. Building on this, two online surveys with workcation travelers were conducted to develop a multi-dimensional scale of workcation travel experiences. Lastly, the nomological network of the developed scale with workcation satisfaction and revisit intentions was investigated. Theoretical and practical implications are provided.}

Multisided Platforms (MSPs) have been one of those digital technologies that digitally transformed brick-and-mortar travel agents to have access to online tools and modules for searching, comparing, and booking travel content. This study examines the factors that are taken into consideration by travel agents in the three phases of the adoption process, namely, pre-adoption, during-adoption, and post-adoption phases. A qualitative study was taken up for this purpose and seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with international travel agents. The findings of this study were twofold. First, the findings of the study adhered to the existing factors of the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model such as relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability, as crucial factors for adopting MSPs. Second, the findings of the study extended the DOI model by proposing two other factors, supportability, and integrability, which were deemed crucial by travel agents when adopting MSPs. The study shows that as part and parcel of the DOI model, travel agents by adopting MSPs get access to global content from multiple-channels and multiple-providers easily and securely. The study discusses practical and theoretical implications.}

To estimate current interest from prospective students and profesionals in cybersecurity across each country, leaderboards from the popular TryHackMe gamified cybersecurity training platform are referenced. We further discuss issues by considering the related formal education programmes offered by the top universities in each country, identified by their presence in the QS world university rankings. The data are then used to propose two new metrics: the “Cybersecurity Education Prospects Index” (CEPI) and the “Cybersecurity Industry Prospects Index” (CIPI), which show how most of the eleven countries in Southeast Asia do have an unmet demand for cybersecurity education and only a few of them have already developed an educational infrastructure that is ready to support the growing needs of the local and international industry.}

This Discovery! essay focuses on innovations built on artificial intelligence (AI) as the center-technology influencing 1) dental eHealth data management, 2) clinical and technical health care applications, and 3) services and operations. AI systems enable personalized dental medicine workflows by analyzing all eHealth data gathered from an individual patient. Besides dental-specific data, this also includes genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic information and therefore facilitates optimized and personalized treatment strategies and risk management. Based on the power of AI, the triangular frame of “data”/“health care”/“service” is supplemented by technological advancements in the field of social media, Internet of things, augmented and virtual reality, rapid prototyping, and intraoral optical scanning as well as teledentistry. Innovation continues to be critical to tackle dental problems until its routine implementation based on sound scientific evidence. Novel technologies must be viewed critically in relation to the cost-benefit ratio and the ethical implications of a misleading diagnosis or treatment produced by AI algorithms. Highly sensitive eHealth data must be handled responsibly to enable the immense benefits of these technologies to be realized for society. The focus on patient-centered research and the development of personalized dental medicine have the potential to improve individual and public health, as well as clarify the interconnectivity of disease in a more cost-effective way.}

Although this digitization is seen as a positive transformation, digital tools can also put additional job demands on employees, resulting in negative HR outcomes. An example of a job demand resulting from such digital tools is red tape. By building on the job demands-resources model, we developed a theoretical model investigating the relationship between red tape originating from digital tools and turnover intention. Our data analysis (N = 779 teachers; 91 school leaders) provides evidence for a positive indirect relationship between red tape originating from digital tools and turnover intention, through emotional exhaustion. Additionally, our results also suggest that the amount of red tape perceived by an employee’s leader will exacerbate the strength of this indirect relationship, hereby providing evidence that a factor at leader-level can exacerbate effects on a lower level.}

Mixed research of an exploratory sequential design was used. Analyses of in-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 41) were carried out, followed by quantitative data collection (N = 146) through survey items corresponding to formalized research questions. The findings revealed that the set of skills suggested by other researchers as key for implementing Industry 4.0 and ensuring future competitiveness was not recognized as currently necessary or missing by the respondents. Although the respondents appreciate the importance of personal characteristics like responsibility, loyalty, communication skills, and other soft skills, these characteristics and skills are often missing. Respondents from high-tech industries tend to perceive more significant gaps in STEM education and skills. Implications for the education system in terms of its content (STEM and soft skills) and structure (organization of technical education and lifelong learning) are suggested.}

abstract = {Digitalization has far-reaching implications for individuals, organizations, and society. While extant management and organization studies mainly focus on the positive aspects of this development, the dark and potentially unexpected sides of digitalization for organizations and organizing have received less scholarly attention. This special issue extends this emerging debate. Drawing on empirical material of platform corporations, social movements, and traditional corporations, eight articles illuminate the various negative implications of the digitalization of work and organization processes, particularly for workers, employees, and activists. In this introduction, we contextualize these valuable contributions that underline the dangers of the ubiquity and simultaneity of digitalization and begin to sketch out potential avenues toward a comprehensive critical agenda of digitalization in organization studies.}

abstract = {Objectives: To determine the prevalence of frailty among community-dwelling older adults in regional Victoria, Australia. Methods: Frailty status of 376 participants from the Crossroads II cross-sectional study was assessed by selected markers of frailty. The selected variables were psychometrically tested. Associations between frailty and socio-demographic, environmental and health factors were analysed using chi-square, ANOVA and binary logistic regression (BLR). Results: Estimated prevalence of frailty was 39.4%. BLR indicated that frailty decreased with higher educational attainment, (OR = .23; 95% CI: .10–.51) increased for divorced/separated participants (OR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.29–5.56) and when having three (OR = 3.27; 95% CI: 1.07–9.98), four (OR = 7.20; 95% CI: 2.22–23.31) or five or more chronic conditions (OR = 9.18; 95% CI: 2.83–29.72). Discussion: Frailty in this Australian regional community-dwelling sample was higher than other studies conducted in urban areas of Australia. Present results highlight the importance of exploring the multidimensionality of the frailty construct to have a better understanding which factors are associated with the development of this syndrome.}

abstract = {Industrialised countries are currently facing the knowledge-to-digital economy transition. That transition is strictly defined by how the labour market is organised and operates in the national economy. Some old to new phenomena are determinants of those dimensions, such as educational mismatch, credential inflation, and job polarisation. These phenomena affect the relationship between schooling and earnings, carrying consequences for social mobility, household welfare, and an individual’s social progression perspective. Those phenomena remain understudied in the context of Latin America. Chile’s case has gained relevance in the region due to the highly deregulated organisation of its educational market, the quality increase in its higher education institutions, and its funding policies for higher education. This work attempts to provide an extended diagnosis of the Chilean labour market, considering the impact of these emerging issues on the educational market and policymaking. The results show that 83.6% of Chilean employees experience an educational mismatch (overeducation and undereducation); credential inflation has depreciated the value of education over five of the six occupational categories – besides the polarisation index for industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom.}

abstract = {Contemporary media systems are in transition. The constellation of organizations, groups, and individuals contributing information to national and international news flows has changed as a result of the digital transformation. The “hybrid media system” has proven to be one of the most instructive concepts addressing this change. Its focus on the mutually dependent interconnections between various types of media organizations, actors, and publics has inspired prolific research. Yet the concept can tempt researchers to sidestep systematic analyses of information flows and actors’ differing degrees of influence by treating media systems as a black box. To enable large-scale, empirical comparative studies aimed at identifying interdependencies and power relationships in contemporary media systems, we propose the concept of discursive power. This describes the ability of contributors to communication spaces to introduce, amplify, and maintain topics, frames, and speakers, thus shaping public discourses and controversies that unfold in interconnected communication spaces. We also provide a theoretical framework of how structural features of organizations and media systems contribute to the emergence of discursive power for different types of actors in various contexts. This adds to the theoretical toolkit available to researchers interested in the empirical analysis of contemporary media systems.}

This paper examines student perspectives of the changes to their education. In October 2020, students worldwide participated in the Digital Inclusion Challenge, a hackathon-style event hosted by Convergence.Tech, a digital transformation company. Participants described barriers to learning and proposed solutions to increase inclusivity and effectiveness. Using thematic analysis, student-identified barriers and their proposed solutions were coded and explored. Overall, themes of four barriers to digital inclusion in education and themes of six solutions were identified. The findings demonstrate what students value in their education, and what they felt they had lost in the transition to online and remote learning. This research contributes to knowledge on the severe impacts of the loss of in-person learning and explores technological and conceptual innovations ideated by youth. Further, it provides insight into global student experiences in accessing education during the pandemic and offers considerations for future research.}

IT-enabled systems have ushered in a new era of digital transformation of traditional ways of functioning of citizen service deliveries in the country. Governance, thus, has found a new meaning through the currency of digital change. Services which earlier were exploited as reserved for privileged and classy people have become available for common citizens without any rent-seeking or exploitation. The most important factor associated with digital transformation is nothing but access to information and transparency. Every service has now a trace, a link and a face, which can be analysed at a later stage to provide the efficacy of the system and certain room for improvement. Having said these, it may not be concluded that there are no challenges and stumbling blocks on the way of e-governance, “digital divide” being the most prominent challenge in the way of bigger mandate to reach out to all the citizens by the state. However, growing Smartphones and falling data rates have enabled substantial part of the citizens to avail digital services rendered by the state. Even though the common service centre has been operating for quite some time efficiently and effectively, some important challenges have been flagged in the article. A glimpse of the best practices from leading countries doing good in e-governance initiatives is also included in the analysis.}

However, the adoption of technologies has often been challenging for public administrations. In this article, the adoption of AI in governmental organizations has been researched as a form of information and communication technologies (ICT)–enabled governance innovation in the public sector. Based on findings from three cases of AI adoption in public sector organizations, this article shows strong similarities between the antecedents identified in previous academic literature and the factors contributing to the use of AI in government. The adoption of AI in government does not solely rely on having high-quality data but is facilitated by numerous environmental, organizational, and other factors that are strictly intertwined among each other. To address the specific nature of AI in government and the complexity of its adoption in the public sector, we thus propose a framework to provide a comprehensive overview of the key factors contributing to the successful adoption of AI systems, going beyond the narrow focus on data, processing power, and algorithm development often highlighted in the mainstream AI literature and policy discourse.}

The way we work, learn, live, and play daily has drastically changed with the revolution of digital systems from their analog predecessor. This transformation warrants the digital environment as a social determinant of health. It comprises the whole continuum from the tangible aspects of the computing devices, their programing and information system, the network technologies connecting them, and the product of interactivity between people to people and people to the digital interface. Despite permeating the everyday life of each level of society, the digital environment has yet to be scrutinized comprehensively in terms of health. A review of the literature produces fragmented results where different specialties within and beyond the medical field lay claim to the various aspects of digitalization. We proposed five domains within the digital environment namely digital transformation, digital health, digital technology, digital identity, and digital media that exerts diversified pressure on the digital environment through human activities. Their subjacent linkage to human health and environmental impact is further discussed by using the DPSEEA framework. Challenges that crossed all domains were discussed including the widening gap of inequalities secondary to the limited availability of, and accessibility to digitalization. Considering the rapid speed at which we propel to a fully immersive virtual world, a timely transformation of environmental health to include the digital environment as part of its main components is inevitable.}

This study examines the drivers of the tourism sector’s growth and catch-up performance in 13 industrialized economies over the period 2000–2015, using data from the EU-KLEMS database. The findings have three notable policy implications. First, the tourism sector in most countries experienced significant growth. However, value-added growth was driven largely by labor employment expansion while labor productivity declined in most countries. Second, weak investment in non–information and communications technology (ICT) capital and declining total factor productivity are the principal impediments to labor productivity growth. Third, all countries embraced digital transformation but many lagged on innovation and labor quality. These findings are analyzed to identify policy strategies for the tourism sector’s postpandemic recovery.}

The challenge-based survey conducted among 281 reporting journalists from various countries revealed that their information skills and literacy are average. The survey results show that half of the respondents (52%) recognise the importance of these characteristics, while 38% are sure that information literacy and skills are not necessary and 10% chose the variant “I am not sure”. As the indicators show, the main aim for investigative journalists’ writing is to influence the society’s mind about some facts presented in the reports (40%). Only 25% of respondents write with the purpose to present reliable information that indicates the level of their information literacy. The latest strategies in the professional development of investigative journalists in modern social media era allow overcoming the major challenges, including those related to the influence and interests of third parties. The practical significance and prospects of further research are explained by the possibility of using the obtained statistical data to increase the level of information literacy and skills not only of investigative journalists, but also other specialists who work with information.}

Methods The MSOC was developed in two arms: intervention arm which contained evidence-based lifestyle modification recommendations, and standard-care arm which delivered information from MS websites reflecting standard advice. Participants were recruited via online advertisements, completed a baseline questionnaire, and randomised. Seven modules were delivered over six weeks. Course completers were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Within a qualitative paradigm, interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Fourteen of the 17 course completers were interviewed: 86% (12/14) female; mean age 50 years; residing in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, predominantly had relapsing-remitting MS, mean time from diagnosis 9.5 years, and patient-determined disease steps disability assessment distributed evenly across all three categories. Four themes were identified: 1) “Hearing our stories” (hope for the future, feeling represented, exploring the journey of others with MS, learning from diversity, and wanting to connect with others); 2) “Taking the plunge” (not wanting to be first, feelings of nervousness or reluctance and feeling confronted); 3) “The accessibility and safety of being online” (ease of access, going at your own pace, making it work and not letting others down); and 4) “unpacking the course” (ease of navigation, visuals, understandability, and length and timing). Conclusion Participants felt represented, found the course accessible and content was easy to understand. These experiences provide important insights and considerations for this digital health intervention.}

We map four basic forms of platform-mediated work against three variations of (in)visibility: (1) perceptible, (2) institutional, and (3) individual, and discuss the implications through the stories of three protagonists of platform workers. The suggested meta-analysis tool for understanding the mechanism of rendering platform workers obscure exposes who is recognized as a worker, what is recognized as work, and how these questions are negotiated in a platform-mediated digital space.

Despite the aim of digital transformation in the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, this has not been fully realised and there is no consensus on the skills and competencies required for allied health professionals (AHPs). This qualitative study undertook two focus groups with twelve AHPs to evaluate the AHP Digital Competency Framework in the UK. The participants recognised the importance of a digital technology in their clinical practice and perceived digital literacy as essential for AHPs. In relation to the AHP framework, participants agreed that competencies in digital technology were clinically relevant, and assessment of these competencies should be performed regularly in practice. However, the majority were unaware of the AHP digital competency framework and suggested improvements to optimise its use in practice and identified areas for improvement. Overall, the AHP Digital Competency Framework has the potential, with better dissemination and further refinement of the wording, to become a useful tool to support the enhancement of digital competency in AHPs and improve the delivery of patient care.}

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a chatbot in assessing the stress levels of medical students in everyday conversations and to identify the main condition for accepting a chatbot as a conversational partner based on validated stress instruments, such as the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ20). Methods In this mixed-methods research design, medical-student stress level was assessed using a quantitative (digital- and paper-based versions of PSQ20) and qualitative (chatbot conversation) study design. PSQ20 items were also shortened to investigate whether medical students’ stress levels can be measured in everyday conversations. Therefore, items were integrated into the chat between medical students and a chatbot named Melinda. Results PSQ20 revealed increased stress levels in 43.4% of medical students who participated (N  =  136). The integrated PSQ20 items in the conversations with Melinda obtained similar subjective stress degree results in the statistical analysis of both PSQ20 versions. Qualitative analysis revealed that certain functional and technical requirements have a significant impact on the expected use and success of the chatbot. Conclusion The results suggest that chatbots are promising as personal digital assistants for medical students; they can detect students’ stress factors during the conversation. Increasing the chatbot’s technical and social capabilities could have a positive impact on user acceptance.}

Using a qualitative approach, this paper examined the implication of the shift to digital media for the future of the indigenous language newspaper in Africa and identifies opportunities for its sustainability within the framework of the theories of technological determinism and alternative media. The analysis indicates poor funding, shrinking patronage, and competition from traditional and social media as the major factors facing indigenous newspapers. It emerged that for indigenous language newspapers to thrive in the rapidly changing and technology-driven world they need to not only adapt to the digital revolution but also explore a business model that combines a futuristic outlook with a practical approach.}

Informants demonstrate how e-books and audiobooks enhance reading experiences, as digital affordances influence the how and the when of literary consumption. Three prominent findings are stated. (1) Readers adapt reading mode to the situation, and experienced readers have developed strategies to maximise the ultimate combination of title, format and reading conditions. (2) Digital reading favours lighter texts. This dimension is more substantial for audiobooks, relating to the wide choice of combining audiobooks with other activities. (3) Being devoted readers motivates people to develop strategies to ensure further reading. These strategies effectively make readers practically and temporally disconnect to immerse in literature.}

abstract = {Digitalization in many economic sectors drove the financial system to adapt to new paradigms of technological transformation. Moreover, the extant regulatory framework forced the financial system to reconsider its business models and its relationship with the market. Such reasons generated also in the banking sector a new model of competition within the ecosystem never seen before in this sector. The new ecosystem of banks and financial institutions lacks a common framework that not only synthesizes the development lines of open innovation in the banking sector but also regarding the planification of strategic choices and organization within the new ecosystems. The present study aims to inquire into the strategic positioning of European banks toward their digital transformation strategies, by analysing the decision-making processes that occurred between 2015 and 2022. A qualitative analysis of partnerships and the adoption of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) development in support of new service models was carried out. Results have relevant policy implications for regulators, linked to the business evolution and the risks of outsourcing, and managerial implications for the followers, specifically on the plan of service integration to diversify and boost their activities in the segment of customer relationship management and care, providing a better user experience.}

abstract = {Even though organizational activities have always been future-oriented, actors’ fascination with the future is not a universal phenomenon of organizational life. Human experience of the future is a rather young product of modernity, in which actors discovered the indeterminacy of the future, as well as their abilities to “make” and, in part, even control and de-problematize it through ever-more sophisticated planning practices. In this essay, we argue that actors have recently “rediscovered” the future as a problematic, open-ended category in organizational life, one that they cannot delineate through planning practices alone. This, we suggest, has been produced through a pluralization of what we refer to as “future-making practices”, a set of practices through which actors produce and enact the future. Based on illustrations of the experienced problematic open-endedness of the future in prevalent discourses such as climate change, digital transformation and post-truth politics, we invite scholars to explore future-making practices as an important but under-appreciated organizational phenomenon.}

This study addresses this gap by leveraging three-factor theory and electronic Word-Of-Mouth data to assess human-robot interaction’ influence on customer satisfaction. Text analytics are deployed alongside a penalty-reward contrast technique on almost 70,000 online reviews spanning 44 hotels worldwide that incorporated service robots into their operations. Customer satisfaction with hospitality services is significantly increased by positive service robots’ performance, while no significant effect is associated with negative service robots’ performance. The traveler type does not moderate the relationship between service robots’ performance and customer satisfaction. These findings, confirmed through Propensity Score Matching, reveal that service robots constitute an “excitement factor” in hospitality service offerings, thus providing a strong incentive for their integration into the workforce. Policymakers are urged to proactively facilitate the transition to a more automated service economy.}

abstract = {This research reveals how social media advances gender responsiveness in the context of China’s digital transformation by exploring ride-hailing services, a fast-growing though often under-regulated sector. Specifically, the rise of ride-hailing has been accompanied by incidents of sexual harassment and gender-based violence, leading to social media outrage. Building on Habermas’s concept of the public sphere, this study – perhaps the first to explore the gender dynamics of ride-hailing policymaking in China – centers on the notion of digital public sphere. This study investigates how citizens, corporations, and government agencies have markedly differed in their discourses on gender and safety. Results exhibit that as corporations and government agencies seek technological and legislative solutions to improve safety, Chinese citizen-based activism efforts have amplified gendered perspectives, addressing gender-responsive policymaking. These actors generate discourses that echo various strands of feminism and further cultivate the policy trajectory, including pressuring government agencies to enforce the social accountability of private corporations. This research addresses a pragmatic perspective to demonstrate how liberal, socialist, and cultural feminisms coexist and negotiate in China’s digital public sphere. It aims to enhance one’s understanding of online civic engagement and resulting policy change in contemporary China, enriching the public sphere theory with emerging technology under a contentious political context.}

To achieve these objectives, an analysis of current accounting curricula of Jordanian universities took place, interviews with professionals and academics were conducted, and a questionnaire survey was administrated to a large sample of academics and professionals. The study found the presence of a significant gap between the courses covered in the accounting curricula of Jordanian universities and the skills acquired by the students versus the market’s requirements and needs. This is mainly due to the fact that the accounting curricula of Jordanian universities are structured based on specific requirements set by the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Commission for Higher Education Institutions (AQACHEI), leaving no freedom for universities to develop curriculums that meet the market’s need. It is also argued that that current exam-based assessment methodology adopted by Jordanian universities largely contributes to expanding the gap. The study recommends giving Jordanian universities more freedom in setting the curriculum for accounting programs, and that they should start revising their accounting curriculums to take into account current market needs.}

The total values of the nine criteria from the lowest to the highest value ranges from 149 to 237 degree. In some criteria, the female students’ awareness level was high, but in other criteria, this level was medium. The students’ awareness level was raised with the following criteria: “digital access to the information sources”, “educational services”, “electronic market”, “digital communication”, “digital etiquette”, “digital laws”, “digital rights and responsibilities”, and “digital security”. On the other hand, female the students’ awareness level was medium with two creating the criterion of “promotion of digital culture” and the criterion of “digital health and safety”. Among the most important recommendations of this study is the enlightenment of society with the digital revolution, and the dissemination of a culture of digital citizenship among Members of the Society, in addition to putting forward a plan at the level of Saudi universities to teach the “digital citizenship” curriculum.}

Training is obviously required for getting the optimal benefits of digital transformation. These activities have become an indispensable strategic tool for enhancing the performances and efficiency of the employees and the overall effectiveness of the organization. Existing literature shows that the effective utilization and continuance of training practices largely depends upon the leadership styles of the organization. In light of the above, our present study focuses to assess the role of leadership in terms of transformational and transactional, in enhancing the overall effectiveness of training practices, particularly in the Indian IT sector organizations. The present study covered five Indian IT sector organizations and came up with conclusions that training does not directly enhance the innovation activities of an organization but has a strong positive bearing on employee efficiency. The study further reveals that the training activities under the transactional leadership pay off at the operational level while under the transformational leadership, it pays off at the strategic level.}

It is argued that the use of digital means of production allows a single person or a small enterprise to realize several or all production stages alone, removing the need to divide the labour. Yet, the increased autonomy connected to this universal approach must be regarded as a mixed blessing. It may imply not only easier entrance to the market for cultural workers, but also fiercer competition and precarious working conditions, especially for individual cultural entrepreneurs.}

OI research has flourished due to the exploration of antecedents under these four research categories, but it is not well integrated across them. The current lack of integration hinders understanding of the factors that can contribute to OI and how these might jointly shape OI development. To address this important unresolved issue, we seek to provide a comprehensive review of research on the antecedents of OI. In our review, we first summarize the existing research that reflects each of the four major research categories. We then suggest several avenues for future research, including exploration of the longitudinal dynamics between the antecedents and how the antecedents will operate in the context of key emerging work trends: remote work and digital transformation.}

PSB companies are engaged in a reconsideration of their audiences. This article discusses the central role of the audience in the transformation from PSB to public service media (PSM), connecting (1) what has been done by PSM companies to grasp opportunities of digitalization to increase their offerings and (2) the public response to these strategies, analysing the consumption of PSM. The article considers two companies as cases: Rai in Italy, a large country and SRG SSR in Switzerland, a small country. Italy and Switzerland differ in the size and structure of their television markets. The market structure, the television distribution systems and the funding schema of the PSM companies analysed have influenced the development of strategies adopted by these companies and also audience responses. Empirical research is based on analysis of relevant policy documents, the case companies’ offerings, interviews with the firms’ operators, and audiences and users data.}

With reference to the work of Esther Leslie, Dick Tomasovic and Stiegler, the author develops a critical account of what Leslie calls the “petrified unrest” evident in the deployment of animation techniques and technologies in contemporary mainstream film and media through analysis of the recent Hollywood blockbuster, San Andreas (dir. Brad Peyton, 2015). This film’s big budget, spectacle-driven narrative and extensive deployment of the latest digital “motion design” tools qualifies it as an exemplary instance of the paradoxical form of contemporary mainstream digital cinema, one which is both innovative and utterly conventional at the same time in Leslie’s account. The author elaborates what Stiegler describes as the spiralling instability of the current, hypercapitalist dynamic in which this paradoxical but ultimately unsustainable “petrified unrest” manifests as a disorienting experience of technological and cultural transformation. For it is only in coming to terms with the profound connections between technological and cultural becoming that the potential can be found to move on from this disorienting condition of digital transformation under the prevailing hypercapitalist mode animating what Leslie terms our “dreamt reality”.}

However, the full potential of digital advancements can only be achieved with the widespread adoption of digital technologies, which depends on the capable delivery of information and communication technologies (ICT) and their effective usability. Despite increased Internet penetration rates in Turkey in recent years, disparities in Internet adoption continue to persist. This study investigates whether and to what extent key demographic and socioeconomic factors are associated with the first-level digital divide in Turkey. The phenomenon is discussed in three aspects: device access, Internet access, and Internet use. The findings demonstrate that the vast majority of people in Turkey have Internet-enabled devices, mainly smartphones. Age, income, and education are significant predictors of Internet access. However, even when access is available, large disparities exist among gender, age, income, education, and employment groups in terms of Internet use. Moreover, our findings reveal significant regional differences in both Internet access and use. The results point to the need for a more coherent vision on ICT policies such that the need for demand-side programs are intended to stimulate broadband adoption widely by those groups. This paper provides useful pointers that can facilitate further academic research and structural decisions among policy-makers, by emphasizing the high-priority target groups.}

The sample consisted of 69 respondents from small-scale companies who conducted marketing activities via the internet, as well as 400 online buyers. The study analysed the data using statistical methods included in the SPSS software package. The study concluded that the current situation at small businesses will not allow them to switch consumers to e-marketing; that is, they are not yet ready for it. The COVID-19 provided many opportunities to these companies, and the results suggest that they should employ strategies such as lead generation, website optimization for search engines, and creating customer-friendly content, efficient supply chains, websites that attract the target customers, online customer interaction and so on to exploit these opportunities.}

To provide some orientation in this transforming space, a national digital education platform (NDEP) is under development in Germany as part of a nationwide flagship project. On the one hand, in efficiently connecting the relevant stakeholders to each other and to value-adding education-related offerings, various benefits emerge. On the other hand, monopolising the educational sector and influencing the respective market through a state-controlled platform bears potential regulatory risks from misuse of power by the platform to malpractice by the users. Against this background, we aim to identify and systematise these potential drawbacks prior to the platform’s actual development and implementation. We pursue a qualitative, interpretivist approach for policy analysis, based on ten elite interviews and two workshops. Our results are threefold: (1) We capture the consolidated NDEP architecture; (2) We categorise the range of relevant functions and value propositions of the NDEP; (3) We derive 23 regulatory areas of conflict across the three building blocks that result from the potential ecosystem and function scope configurations of the NDEP. As a contribution to research, we shed new interdisciplinary light on the governance and infrastructure of public-private platforms that enable innovation and collaboration while integrating respective market segments. As a contribution to practice, we provide clear guidance for policy-makers in strategizing the development and governance of and through national digital platforms in education.}

In this review, the authors aim to organize and synthesize the growing literature on branding, culture, and globalization from a behavioral perspective by reviewing 129 articles published over 25 years. Specifically, they explicate two perspectives found in the literature: (1) global-local branding and (2) the influence of culture on consumer and brand interactions. The authors identify conceptual gaps in the literature and discuss how new realities in the macro environment (e.g., political issues, digital transformation, environmental concerns) may affect the interaction between culture, brands, and consumers in a globalized world. This review facilitates a more impactful future research agenda in both theory and practice at the interface of branding and globalization from the perspective of behavioral outcomes.}

abstract = {When addressing the possible futures for the university, one can ask what the new critical success factors (CSF) are that represent the core of the University of the Future, from a strategic perspective of analysis. Considering the Society 5.0 paradigm, characterized by higher levels of uncertainty, turbulence, and balance between technology and human values, adaptation to the ecosystem becomes an essential competence. Based on the literature, considering the convergence of organizational cybernetics and biomimetics, this theoretical article proposes a set of new CSF for the University of the Future, expanding the analysis of Society 5.0 and the future challenges for universities. Additionally, proposes a maturity model with eleven dimensions and three stages to support this discussion, visioning a future scenario. This foresight approach provides new insights to think over strategic critical success factors for the university to respond to possible and sustainable futures. Reconfiguration, purpose, and digitization are capacities to address the new environment set in this Smart Society. With this analysis, strategic questions are proposed for researchers and practitioners, especially to address global and regional challenges that universities will face, particularly due to the technological gap established between countries.}

Are works councils, as an important form of workplace representation of employees’ interests, prepared to bring employees’ interests into company digitalisation processes, and does this affect their own position of power? To answer these questions, four in-depth qualitative case studies of works councils from German industrial companies are conducted. The results show that works councils can rely on important resources in the bargaining of digitalisation processes. Through the combination of resource use with other factors, such as the perception of digitalisation and the (un)willingness of management to involve works councils, three different constellations can be identified under which dealing with digitalisation represents an opportunity or a threat for works councils.}

abstract = {This article employs national longitudinal media and opinion surveys from Sweden’s SOM Institute as a lens to engage media convergence theory during the period 1995 to 2012. Building on rhetorical analysis of SOM questions, the article both concretizes media convergence theory and promotes a reexamination of default categories of media analysis: content, platform, and user behavior, or protocol. By using a triangular vector composition model, the article shows how theories of media convergence can be critically evaluated using SOM questions as a data set and that SOM questions reflect and construct fluid and flexible relationships integral to media convergence theory. SOM’s questions regarding emerging media are embedded in the specific historical context of Sweden’s striking, though incomplete and contested, digital transformation. This article is the first of its kind to analyze the content of SOM questions; it does not engage in quantitative survey methodology evaluation. Topical foci are news coverage, digitally networked communication, especially the Internet, and digital cinema. The article further gestures to how SOM questions concretize links between media convergence and political engagement, with specific reference to an accompanying rhetoric on agency and activism that is often abstract. To conclude, we discuss some of the larger implications of SOM surveys with respect to changing media convergence discourse in the 21st century.}

Is there any difference in open innovation effect on the firm according to the changing of belonging sectorial innovation system from catch-up to post-catch-up? We statistically analysed the moderating effects of open innovation between catching-up, and the performance with the patents which were registered in United States Patent and Trademark Office, which were applied from China in telecommunication, from South Korea in Semiconductors, and from Japan in biotechnology on 1995–1999, and 2005–2009. We found three results from this study: first, from this research, as the signal of post catching-up, open innovation effects on the performance of firm, and the moderating effects of open innovation between catching-up, and the performance of the firm were found; second, the appearance of new dominant design after post catching-up was explained through the powerful open innovation and third, open innovation could be a useful new strategy for firms in the post catching-up to use.}

The relationship between individual experience and engagement in avatar-mediated environments has garnered empirical support, but still little is known about the mediating mechanisms underlying this relation. This study investigated the mediating role of interpersonal attraction (e.g., social, physical, and task attraction) in the link between individual experience and engagement in an avatar-mediated learning environment. A total of 112 participants (21–23 years; 73 male and 39 female) participated in online peer learning sessions in Second Life. After controlling for demographic covariates, the results showed that (1) individual experience was positively associated with students’ engagement; (2) social, physical, and task attraction was found to positively mediate the link between experience and engagement. The outcomes from this study provide valuable implications for promoting online learners’ engagement in avatar-mediated environments.}

However, it is unclear how factors such as digital strategy, organization’s bricolage behaviour, financial literacy and organization’s IT capabilities can influence the adoption of new venture digitalization and affect small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) specific business activities. This study is aimed at filling the gap in the literature by creating an understanding of how businesses can utilize their IT capabilities to combine resources towards achieving optimal new venture digitalization. Using gender and educational level as moderators, we examine the effect of organization’s IT capabilities, digital strategy, financial literacy and organization’s bricolage behaviour on new venture digitalization. We find that digital strategy, organizational bricolage behaviour and organization’s IT capabilities have a significant effect on new venture digitalization. Furthermore, digital transformation strengthens SMEs’ ability and flexibility to address main business issues. However, financial literacy has no significant effect on SME digitalization. Also, the gender and educational level of SME entrepreneurs seemed not to be influenced by financial literacy and the adoption of digitalization. These findings increase our understanding of how digital strategy, organization’s bricolage behaviour, financial literacy and organization’s IT capabilities can influence the adoption of new venture digitalization.}

The present Exchange confronts this challenge by juxtaposing platform conceptions with a pre-eminent framework to conceptualize business-to-business relations: global production networks (GPN). Specifically, this Exchange addresses challenges posed by the platform approach for the GPN framework in the four dimensions: value (from owning assets to granting access), governance (from make-or-buy to employ-or-enable), management (from back-end to front-end) and labour (from jobs to gigs).}

The search was conducted in PubMed, Academic Search Elite, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Data were extracted from 53 original articles. The results show an increasing trend in published netnographies over time; 34% of the total sample was published in 2021. Of the total, 28% originated from Sweden, and 81% had used a covert approach. In studies in which the researchers used more participatory designs, the time spent on online forums ranged between 4 weeks and 20 months. Informed consent is found to be an issue in netnographic studies. We discuss the fact that nursing researchers have used netnography to address a wide range of research topics of concern and interest, from self-care support in an online forum for older adults to nursing students’ perspectives on effective pedagogy. In line with the digital transformation in society in general, we discuss the fact that netnography as a research methodology offers great opportunities for nurse researchers to monitor new spaces and places that presuppose online methodological knowledge.}

abstract = {Today’s society is becoming aware that a new economic model of production and consumption must take into account its environmental and social impact. Industries are under increasing pressure from stakeholders to be transparent in reporting the environmental and social impacts of their operations. In this context, sustainable manufacturing must minimize negative environmental impacts and consumption of energy and natural resources, while also being socially responsible and economically viable. That is why the sustainable manufacturing concept is gaining increasing attention both in the research community and in organizations, especially in the industrial sector. However, even today, there is a great diversity of interpretations and ideas associated with this term. Accordingly, this article first presents an overview of the main concepts related to sustainable manufacturing, and metrics to evaluate organizations’ sustainability performance, and then an outlook of current trends. Our work highlights the consistencies and inconsistencies in the research community related to the interpretations of sustainable manufacturing and Industry 4.0, as well as the lack of consensus about the true social impact of Industry 4.0. However, the positive ecological and economic impacts of sustainable manufacturing seem fairly widespread. In this way, sustainable manufacturing practices seem to be reinforced by initiatives within the fourth stage of industrialization – the so-called Industry 4.0 – which offers great opportunities for sustainable manufacturing, thanks to digital transformation.}

In the European Union context, the development of such new business is accompanied by a regulatory and political framework. An important aspect of this regulatory framework regards the legal conditions that enable the data collection, availability, sharing, use and reuse. Within the larger context, this article analyses the development of the European Union regulatory framework governing the availability, sharing and reuse of public sector data, also referred to as Public Sector Information policy. Anchored in the analytical tools provided by Discursive Institutionalism and Critical Data Studies and after studying the evolution of this policy over 25 years, this article argues that economic considerations have been overwhelmingly decisive in the European Union Public Sector Information policy and much less attention has been paid to fundamental rights and democracy issues. It also shows how European Union Public Sector Information policy contributes to the data infrastructure, enabling a thriving data-driven economy. In doing so, this article argues that the possible problematic effects of this new data-driven economy are not only affordances of the technology itself but are also the result of political and regulatory choices. More globally, the article stresses the need for policymakers to inscribe each of the policies and regulations affecting the digital transformation in the framework of fundamental rights and democracy.}

This article charts the evolution of views on the digital workplace and the drivers that now render this an essential strategic direction for organizations. The desirable features of the digital workplace can be achieved now through integration of four technologies – mobile; big data; cloud computing and search-based applications – and with a focus on developing for the mobile environment.

This study aims to explore the potential negative impacts of MIP on future behavioral intention to visit actual tourist attractions. Two rounds of surveys in China show that MIP influenced cognition and emotion, which together may affect future visitation. MIP inspired a desire to visit through learning, although it also decreased interest because of negative emotions. The current study contributes to the virtual tourism literature and MIP theory and suggests implications for the use of virtual technologies in tourism marketing.}

Moreover, the possible impacts of digital transformation on the future of revenue managers’ professions have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Drawing on qualitative data collected through 23 semistructured interviews with revenue managers in luxury and upscale hotels across Jordan, the findings suggest that RM is going through digital transformation with different levels of sophistication. While acknowledging the benefits of digital transformation in saving time, supporting the decision-making process, and yielding more revenues, the high cost of RM software emerges as a key barrier for digital transformation. The findings also reveal that the automation of various manual heuristics in RM is far from being possible, and therefore, digital transformation is unlikely to pose a threat to the future of the RM profession.}

However, extant research so far mainly has focussed on the use of digital technology in recruiting processes and its outcomes, whereas strategic aspects have received little attention. Based on 26 interviews with recruiters in 22 organisations, this study examines the interplay between recruitment and digital transformation beyond the use of digital technology in recruitment, focussing on more strategic aspects. The study examines recruitment’s role in organisations’ digital transformation. We found that the recruitment of digital talent as a new target group triggers change within the company, and does so in three ways: First, recruiters have realised the necessity to adapt their measures and processes to the new target group. Second, recruiters have developed a new self-understanding. Third, recruiters have recognised the need to support the organisation’s digital transformation by taking on a bridging function. Our study makes two contributions: First, we identified two new roles for recruitment during digital transformation: It acts as a “sensory organ” that enhances the organisation’s absorptive capacity; and it takes on the role of a “mediator” between external and internal groups. Second, this study builds on the human resources (HR) literature by analysing the strategic implications that digital transformation imposes on recruitment, highlighting recruitment’s part in renewing an organisation’s human resource base, which is crucial for its digital transformation.}

Our results reveal that technical skills and in-depth expertise in information technologies play only a secondary role in job requirement profiles. Like in earlier strategic change processes, digital transformation experts should primarily possess collaboration, strategic thinking, leadership, customer orientation, and communication skills. Moreover, in contrast to purely conceptual studies limited to skills and abilities, our analyses emphasize the importance of specific personality traits, such as proactivity and creativity, since these are often explicitly mentioned in corresponding job advertisements.}

However, digital literacy studies for administrative staff seem to be neglected in the current literature. This article examines the impact of higher education administrative staff’s digital literacy on their intention to use digital technologies while performing their tasks. For this purpose, a conceptual model consisting of effort expectancy and performance expectancy structures based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and expanded with the digital literacy dimension has been created. Data were collected from 158 participants who were administrative staff of two higher education institutions in Türkiye to evaluate the theoretical model. The data were analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The findings revealed the relationship between the digital literacy skills of higher education administrative staff and their intention to use digital technology. According to the results, digital literacy has a direct effect on effort expectancy but not on performance expectancy. Also, contrary to our expectations, digital literacy does not directly affect the intention to use. However, digital literacy affects the intention to use digital technology through effort expectancy and performance expectancy. In higher education, personnel with low digital literacy skills should be identified and in-service training should be provided. This is one of the first studies to address the impact of digital literacy on technology acceptance by administrative staff working in higher education.}

In practice, despite heavy investments, governments often fail to enact new digital technologies in an efficient, appropriate or fair way. This article provides an overview of techno-rational and socio-political failures and solutions at the macro-, meso- and micro-level to support digital transformation. The reviewed articles suggest a modest approach to digital transformation, with an emphasis on high-quality in-house IT infrastructure and expertise, but also better collaborative networks and strong leadership ensuring human oversight.}

The study argues how manufacturing exporting firms could develop a digital transformation strategy that includes a different aspect of the strategy tailored to the nature of the Indian exporting firms. Dealing with different aspects of digital transformation, the study discusses different perspectives such as core competencies, internal drivers of digital transformation (IDDT) and external drivers of digital transformation (EDDT), enablers of digital transformation (EDT), new capabilities required and strategic imperatives of digital transformation. Synthesizing digitalization through these lenses can help in developing and implementing a successful digital transformation strategy.}

The company specialised in the production of glass bottles. Over the years, the company expanded and set up global footprints, positioning itself as market leader in medical glass products. The expansion into new regions required the use of advanced digital tools that will monitor performance and improve productivity across numerous dispersed manufacturing sites. It was a sweltering day in July 2019, Giuseppe stood next to the air-conditioning system, just 20 m from the overheated production line. It magnified the intensity of output as he explained the innovative ideas he had for the company: “Digital technologies are changing our society and working life and we need to use them to change the way Murano Glass operates and competes”. He described the implementation of an application that enabled remote assistance with augmented reality and a peer-assistance platform to connect employees all over the world. It would unite a geographically dispersed team and streamline connectivity. Despite his enthusiasm for the initiative, however, the budget for digital projects had shrunk and management support was lacking. His ideas for digital transformation were not progressing as he had hoped. Giuseppe wondered what was going wrong in Murano Glass’s digital transformation journey.}

This article presents a series of workshops on scholarly communication literacy as a pedagogical strategy to raise awareness and to prevent novice researchers from falling victim to the challenges of scholarly communication and unethical publishing practices. Most participants perceived these training workshops as an effective educational approach. The results of these educational seminars demonstrate that this type of pedagogical strategy that consists of training, awareness-raising, and prevention approaches is a key factor to informing and warning novice researchers about scholarly communication pitfalls and deceptive publishing practices.}

Marketing is one of the business streams witnessing this transformation on a very intense scale. Contemporary marketing has begun to experiment with modern, cutting-edge technologies, such as AI, deploying them in mainstream operations to ensure accelerated success. This article explores the use of AI in marketing as an emergent stream of research. Based on inferences from earlier studies, the study categorizes marketing into five distinct functional themes—integrated digital marketing, content marketing, experiential marketing, marketing operations, and market research—and 19 sub-functional themes (activity levers). Across the chosen themes and sub-themes, the study further dovetails into and identifies 170 featured use cases of the extant literature, where AI is leveraged by marketing in delivering superior quality outcomes and experiences. By way of a systematic literature review (SLR), the article evaluates 57 qualifying publications in the context of AI-powered marketing and qualitatively and quantitatively ranks them based on their coverage, impact, relevance, and contributed guidance, and elucidates the findings across various sectors, research contexts, and scenarios. The study discusses the practitioner and academic research implications and proposes a future research agenda to study the continuous transformation fostered by accelerated adoption of AI across the marketing landscape.}

India achieved FinTech adoption rate of 87 percent as against the global average of 64 percent mostly contributed by FinTech startups aiming for providing access to financial services even in the remotest areas. Realizing the potential of FinTech to contribute toward financial inclusion and stability, the Governments have taken requisite steps toward digital transformation and promote FinTech ventures. In order to meet the customers’ needs, collaborative moves with FinTech firms have been initiated by financial institutions as well. This article aims to investigate the relationship between different demographic profiles, the adoption of FinTech services, the perception, user pattern, and constraints faced by the bank customers in using FinTech services. The results based on survey of 215 respondents reveal significant association between usage of FinTech services and different demographic profiles. However, the awareness and use of such services is found more among millennials and generation Z as compared with generation X and baby boomers. While the FinTech companies gained the popularity in payment space, it is observed that misconception is an important factor that hinders the growth of technology-based services among respondents.}

abstract = {Leveraging the findings of the extant body of literature, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia, like any other country of the world, are central to economic development, industrial development, job creation and poverty reduction. Nevertheless, given the megatrends, which represent huge transformative global forces with far-reaching effect on individuals, society, culture, business and economies, and the need for enhancement of Malaysian SMEs to facilitate the achievement of Malaysian SME master plan (2012–2020), Malaysian SMEs are left with no option other than aligning their policies and strategies with the megatrends, which demands that SMEs should provide “added-value” services, and products, or high-quality and innovative products and services. SMEs could achieve this through the strategic development of the firm’s rare, inimitable and non-substitutable human resource. To offer empirical insights on this issue, this study investigated the mediating role of employee creativity in the high-performance work practices (HPWPs)–performance nexus. Via the cross-sectional research approach, data were collected from a sample of 287 managers of Malaysian SMEs in Kedah, Penang and Perak states of Malaysia. The partial least squares algorithm and the bootstrapping technique were used for data analysis. The overall findings signify the mediating effect of employee creativity on job design–performance nexus, indicating that job design, which facilitates workers’ autonomy to utilize their capabilities, would enable and stimulate the workers to adapt their approaches to meet the unique needs of the customers and the transformative global forces, because digital transformation has changed SMEs’ operations and delivery models. Also, HPWPs that focus on development of creative problem-solving skill can enhance workers’ ability to generate alternative solutions, product knowledge and customer service skills which are crucial to creativity in the organization. Finally, the implications, limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.}

To capture this phenomenon, we introduce the notion of stalling strategies. We argue that stalling strategies have allowed digital platforms to create time that they have spent generating revenue and accumulating platform power, which later protected them from state actions. Drawing on a case study of Uber in Poland and a number of shadow cases, we distinguish five stalling strategies: reinventing classifications, dragging out court proceedings, stealing the time of street-level bureaucrats, delaying new regulations, and taking time to (not) comply. By analyzing stalling strategies, this article contributes to discussions about the politics of platform capitalism, the temporality of digitalization, and institutional drift.}

The present article considers some of the questions these commercial BVODs raise for television policy in Australia, with specific reference to local content regulation. Through content audits of 7Plus, 9Now and 10Play, we assess the localism of the BVODs’ catalogues in terms of the availability and discoverability of Australian titles. We find that these BVOD services – which are not presently regulated for local content – are less local in their programming than the networks’ free-to-air linear channels, but are more local than competing subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix and Prime Video. We also reflect on how the networks position themselves in the newly expanded Australian television market, and how they reconcile their historical status as protected national broadcast institutions with their newer status as “just another app” in the streaming ecosystem.}

The case in question focuses on Riotminds, a Swedish RPG publishing company that in 2010, in one broad stroke, transformed and converged all their analogue printed products into a single, online subscription service. Drawing on a general theoretical framework of materiality and (cultural) practice, the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of digitization by asking: What does this particular instance of technological transformation and expressions of resistance reveal about materiality and the ongoing tensions between what constitutes meaningful digital and analogue immersive experiences? The results contribute to a critical, materialist perspective on digitization that encompasses both Digital’s virtues and challenges in terms of the digital transformation of physical practices and physical space. In other words, forwarding an understanding of digitalization as an intricate aesthetic shift, where identified analog sensibilities are converted into digital sensibilities, and its consequences for creating meaningful gaming experiences on behalf of the user (or player).}

With the rise of the Internet of medical things (IoMT), along with smart devices, the med-tech industry is on the cusp of a home-care revolution, which could also create opportunity for developing effective solutions with significant potential to reduce DFU-associated costs and saving limbs. This article discusses potential applications of IoMT to the DFU patient population and beyond. Methods: To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with implementing IoMT for management of DFU, the authors reviewed recent relevant literatures and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including podiatry, engineering, and data security. Results: The IoMT has opened digital transformation of home-based diabetic foot care, as it enables promoting patient engagement, personalized care and smart management of chronic and noncommunicable diseases through individual data-driven treatment regimens, telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback tailored to individual requirements. In particular, with recent advances in voice-activated commands technology and its integration as a part of IoMT, new opportunities have emerged to improve the patient’s central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized health care ecosystem. Conclusions: The IoMT has opened new opportunities in health care from remote monitoring to smart sensors and medical device integration. While it is at its early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home that, using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, may augment much of what home health does today.}

abstract = {When economists talk about “measurement” they tend to refer to metrics that can capture changes in quantity, quality and distribution of goods and services. In this paper we argue that the digital transformation of the economy, particularly the rise of cloud computing as a general-purpose technology, can pose serious challenges to traditional concepts and practices of economic measurement. In the first part we show how quality-adjusted prices of cloud services have been falling rapidly over the past decade, which is currently not captured by the deflators used in official statistics. We then discuss how this enabled the spread of data-driven business models, while also lowering entry barriers to advanced production techniques such as artificial intelligence or robotic-process-automation. It is likely that these process innovations are not fully measured at present. A final challenge to measurement arises from the fragmentation of value chains across borders and increasing use of intangible intermediate inputs such as intellectual property and data. While digital technologies make it very easy for these types of inputs to be transferred within or between companies, existing economic statistics often fail to capture them at all.}

abstract = {The governance of Vocational Education and Training (VET) systems in Germany and Switzerland is determined by a constellation of actors that has grown over many years. This constellation has long-term elements and at the same time it is a flexible system that is subject to constant pressure to change, just like the economic and social structures that support them. One driver of change in recent years is undoubtedly the so-called digitalisation, which has set in motion sustainable processes of change in companies, called Industry 4.0. These dynamic developments can lead to a change in the distribution of roles among the actors. An appropriate analysis contributes to highlighting the differences in the governance structures of the two systems. The article shows the relevance of the different legal frameworks for the actors’ options for action in the context of digitalisation and its consequences on the adaptability of the two VET systems. Furthermore, it points out some areas of conflict in the respective actor constellations.}

abstract = {Digitalisation is transforming the railway globally. One of the major considerations in digital transformation of any industry including the railway is the increased exposure to cyberattacks. The railway industry is vulnerable to these attacks because since the number of digital items and also number of interfaces between digital and physical components in the railway systems keep increasing. Increased number of items and interfaces require new frameworks, concepts and architectures to ensure the railway system’s resilience with respect to cybersecurity challenges, such as lack of proactiveness, lack of holistic perspective and obsolescence of safety systems exposed to current and future cyber threats landscape. To this date, there are several works carried out in the literature that studied the cybersecurity aspects and its application on railway infrastructure. However, to develop and implement an appropriate roadmap to cybersecurity in railways, there is a need of describing emerging challenges, and approaches to deal with these challenges and the possibilities and benefits of these. Hence, the objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review and outline cybersecurity emerging trends and approaches, and also to identify possible solutions by querying literature, academic and industrial, for future directions. The authors of this paper conducted separate searches through four popular databases, that is, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and IEEE explore. For the screening process, authors have used keywords with Boolean operators and database filters and identified 90 articles most relevant to the study domain. The analysis of 90 articles shows that majority of the cybersecurity studies lies within the railways are conceptual and lags in application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based security. Like other industries, it is very important that railways should also follow latest security technologies, trends and train their workforce for cyber hygiene since railways are already in digitalization transition mode.}

Contact restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of Public Administration in most countries and has increased the social digital divide. Therefore, the training of citizens in digital competences is one of the main challenges of the knowledge society. This mixed-methods systematic review protocol aims to synthesize quantitative and qualitative findings about conditioning factors of digital inclusion, in a multidimensional perspective, related with the education, healthcare and welfare sectors and the political actions involved to improve the digital competences of citizenship for allowing and enhancing their interactions with these online public services. The protocol has been written following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Nine databases including Web of Science, Scopus, Educational Resources Information Center Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA), ProQuest, MEDLINE, PubMed, SocINDEX and Cairn.info will be searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies published from 2011 or later. Grey literature and citation chaining will be undertaken. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies will be included. Data items will be extracted and coded in a standardized format. A convergent segregated approach to synthesis and integration will be used. The results will be of interest to educational policymakers who want to take into account citizens’ digital skills in the design of online services and lifelong learning programs.}

abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet’s interconnections has led to a substantial increase in cyberattack incidents, often with devastating and grave consequences for the organizations and their associated clientele. The pandemic of COVID-19 has pushed most organizations towards digital transformation. The higher dependence of a firm on digital infrastructure makes it more vulnerable to cyber-crimes. The existing literature suggests that the most notable and frequently chosen weapons of attackers are Internet of things (IoT) attacks, phishing attack, malware attack, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack and structured query language (SQL) injection attack. In this study, an attempt has been made to generate a protection framework from these cyberattacks. In doing so, the present research has adopted a systematic stepwise process of investigation. The research method consists of four components. First, through bibliometric analysis in VOSviewer, authors identified the scope for searching the related literature published worldwide and generated visualization for comprehension. This step led to the selection of 60 research articles for further analysis. After that, each security threat’s MAXQDA software word tree was developed, representing its linkages with possible security solutions and control measures. Lastly, they adopted expert elicitation protocol through semi-structured interviews with six corporate IT experts and five academic experts. The synthesis of information gathered leads to the development of a suggestive protection framework for the organizations.}

abstract = {Purpose: In an era of networked production of the public sphere and with the arrival of new communicator roles such as citizen journalists, influencers and bloggers, the “old” roles and professions of “the journalist” and “public relations professional” are challenged. In this paper, avoiding the familiar debate about antagonisms between journalism and public relations, we provide empirical insights that identify specific characteristics of a convergence in the “doing” of public relations and journalism. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper presents recent data from a series of comparative interviews, conducted in Central Europe (Austria, n = 10, Germany, n = 25), New Zealand (n = 7), Australia (n = 25), and the Pacific Islands (n = 5). The conversational narrative interviews bring in self-reflections on skillsets, professions, normative frameworks and the doing of professional communication from a range of communicators, primarily public relations practitioners and journalists, but also activist campaigners, science communicators, bloggers, and social influencers. Findings: The findings show that while interviewees were likely to represent their roles as related to a singular, across those roles they presented what they did – the “doing” – as akin to that of an authorial “curator” of communication in the context of societal transformations and constantly changing and converging media environments. Across different communicator roles professional communication is increasingly perceived as a co-creational process of entering, initiating, sometimes managing, and, thus, driving public discourses and conversations. Originality/Value: The paper complements the debate around skills and professionalization in public relations and adds to broader discussions about role responsibility, agency, and authorship related to public conversations in an age of digital transformation and social change by bringing in the concept of curating as the co-operative “management of stories” between, and across, professional roles.}

abstract = {Background: This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes in emergency department (ED) presentations incurred by patients with alcohol use disorders. Methods: A retrospective quantitative analysis was conducted on patients’ ED presentations between December 2011 and January 2019 in an Australian regional health district. The health district has five EDs serving rural, regional, and metropolitan areas. Patients with alcohol use disorders were divided into two groups for comparison: those who had interactions with the community-based Drug and Alcohol (D&A) services and those who did not. Results: A total of 2,519 individual patients with alcohol use disorders made 21,715 ED presentations. Among these patients, 75.4% did not have interactions with the community-based D&A services. Compared with those who had, these patients were older, more likely to be diagnosed with abdominal pain (26.9% vs 12.0%, p < 0.001) and chest pain (16.2% vs 8.6%, p < 0.001), and had longer mean length of ED stay (7 hours and 41.7 minutes vs 6 hours and 25.6 minutes, p < 0.001). For the patients who had interactions with the community-based D&A services, their 28-day re-presentation rates decreased from 55.5% (2013–14) to 45.1% (2017–18); however, were higher than that of those who had no interactions (41.1% to 32.8%). Overall, 21.9%−24.5% of the patients were frequent ED presenters (i.e., ≥4 visits per year). Frequent ED presenters were proportionately higher among the patients who had interactions with the community-based D&A services, consistently over the relevant years. Although patients with alcohol use disorders frequently presented to EDs, their alcohol use disorders were only identified in 8.9% of their presentations. Conclusions: Patients with alcohol use disorders were often unidentified in EDs. Those who did not have interactions with the community-based D&A services were less likely to be diagnosed with alcohol use disorders when presenting to EDs.}

However, little is known about the issuing agencies and the topics of health informatisation policies. This study aimed to explore the collaboration of policies issuing and the evolution of policy topics. In this study, a total of 156 policy documents were identified. Author–Topic model and pre-discretised method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation model were employed to mine the correlation between the issuing agencies and policy topics, and the evolution of policy contents. Findings suggest that the development of health informatisation policies can be divided into three stages. The number of policies has been increasing constantly, among which the policy of opinion and notification accounts for the vast majority. Many government agencies are involved in formulating policies collaboratively. On the whole, the topics changed constantly over time. From 2003 to 2008, policy topics focused on standards and specifications, with the phenomenon of splitting and development. From 2009 to 2014, policies were predominantly related to the construction of regional health informatisation, with some emerging topics generating. Internet + medical and new information technology gained attention from 2015 to 2020; most topics in this period were inherited, split or merged from the previous period. This study is helpful to research and formulation of the health informatisation-related policies.}

These arrangements are predicated as bottom-up, decentralized, democratic, and participatory while still driven by the corporate logics of lock-in and scaling-up. Reporting on a multisite ethnographic study of a global decentralized IoT initiative, this article explores how a diversity of geographically dispersed contributors reckoned with and negotiated conflicting future visions of globality, locality, and growth. From a socio-material perspective, it argues that the imaginaries and actualizations of decentralization were strategically altered over time to balance unevenness of pace, expectations, and material commitments between different actors. The article offers a new critical perspective to think about infrastructure decentralization as more than the flip side of centralization but as a contingent and mobilizing concept and locates this case in discussions about the future of the Internet.}

abstract = {Technological advancement has forced academic libraries to change their traditional services by adopting emerging technologies to respond to the changing information needs of their users, who are now more technologically inclined and prefer remote and timely access to scholarly information. Smart technologies are the recent trend in academic libraries. Smart technologies have the potential to enhance academic library services provision and also support the distance learning environment, especially now as higher education embraces online and distance learning. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the level of implementation of smart services at academic libraries and the challenges they face in developing and/or providing smart services. A questionnaire was developed to collect the required data from library staff (N = 340) at academic libraries in Jordan, where (246) responded and completed the questionnaire. The results indicate a moderate level of implementation of smart services at academic libraries in Jordan (M = 3.12). The result also shows that the challenges facing the libraries to implement and offer smart services was also moderate (M = 3.57). Resistance to change was the main challenge libraries face in their attempt to embrace smart technology to offer smart services. Also, privacy and confidentiality appeared to be one of the top rated challenges libraries have to deal with when planning for smart services deployment. Moreover, financial-related issues, such as poor infrastructure and staff training were among the main challenges librarians face to develop/offer smart services. Most importantly, challenges negatively affect the level of smart services at academic libraries in Jordan. This paper provides insights for academic librarians and decision-makers in planning for the provision of smart services at their libraries. It highlights the main challenges that might hinder the implementation and provision of smart services.}

Each new step in the development and application of AI is accompanied by speculations about a supposedly imminent but largely fictional artificial general intelligence (AGI) with (super-)human capacities, as seen in the unfolding discourse about capabilities and impact of large language models (LLMs) in the wake of ChatGPT. These far-reaching expectations lead to a discussion on the societal and political impact of AI that is largely dominated by unfocused fears and enthusiasms. In contrast, this article provides a framework for a more focused and productive analysis and discussion of AI’s likely impact on one specific social field: democracy. First, it is necessary to be clear about the workings of AI. This means differentiating between what is at present a largely imaginary AGI and narrow artificial intelligence focused on solving specific tasks. This distinction allows for a critical discussion of how AI affects different aspects of democracy, including its effects on the conditions of self-rule and people’s opportunities to exercise it, equality, the institution of elections, and competition between democratic and autocratic systems of government. This article shows that the consequences of today’s AI are more specific for democracy than broad speculation about AGI capabilities implies. Focusing on these specific aspects will account for actual threats and opportunities and thus allow for better monitoring of AI’s impact on democracy in an interdisciplinary effort by computer and social scientists.}

The proposed framework integrates three themes: (1) service interaction space to capture the interrelationship among devices, interfaces, interactions, and journeys; (2) learning and coordination as core capabilities for generating and using intelligence, respectively, to enhance customer engagement in subsequent interactions; and (3) one-voice strategy to configure learning and coordination capabilities in combinations that meet conditions of fitness and equifinality for effective customer engagement.

abstract = {This article is based on research investigating collective memory in the enactment of leadership identities. The context is derived from a study of Māori leadership and decision-making. The methodology is qualitative and underpinned by Kaupapa Māori research. Methods include pūrākau – Māori epistemology in the form of storytelling. Data is sourced from digital archives in the form of documentaries capturing a rich array of Māori leadership in ritual, ceremonies and interviews with leaders in multiple settings. The process of wānanga (collaborative interactive learning) was required for translation of material from Te Reo Māori into English. As a central feature of a Māori collective memory paradigm, words act as a key, unlocking insight and deeper levels of understanding inherent in Māori epistemology, mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and ontology. We employ whakapapa, a framework for understanding cultural identity and layering of relationships to inform analysis by offering a new concept to the literature; pūmahara, a generative collective memory code. This highlights continuity in the enactment of Māori leadership identities and values which signal social affiliation, self-affirmation and belonging. In terms of contributions, first, the study confirms that as repositories for social and collective memory, digital archives offer a potent opportunity to investigate collective memory in the enactment of leadership identities. Second, a new way of analysing the data through culturally derived methods including wānanga, pūrākau and whakapapa is offered. Third, a distinctive contribution to leadership identity research via a conceptual model highlighting interactions between cognitive, affective, relational, material and cultural values is detailed. Finally, we conclude by offering further avenues of research aimed to advance leadership identity research. In summary, this article offers a distinctive contribution to leadership identity research drawing on collective memory theory.}

abstract = {Colleges and universities in the United States swiftly shifted campus-based classes to virtual spaces as a response to extended campus closures necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Synchronous online courses were mandated as a replacement for traditional face-to-face classes in many higher education institutions. We understand that the benefits and drawbacks of synchronous courses need to be reviewed in this environment that has been heavily impacted by the pandemic. Thus, two survey studies were conducted in the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters. The findings in Study 1 reveal that students felt more isolated in their studying in the early phase of the pandemic, which increased their preference for the synchronous modality. The results of Study 2 suggest that the perceived isolation effect no longer held. The results from both studies confirm that students prefer an equal split between synchronous and asynchronous components for conceptual courses but prefer additional synchronous components for quantitative courses. A series of regression analyses was conducted to account for such preferences. The results urge educators and administrators to develop a hybrid approach that leverages the benefits of synchronous and asynchronous courses and optimizes online learning and teaching experiences.}

Using data on 31 Chinese provinces, the study integrated the TOE framework with Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to examine the digital economy. The results indicate that (a) firms’ digital competence is a necessary condition for the development of the digital economy; (b) four pathways drive high levels of digital economic development and three pathways lead to low levels of digital economic development; and (c) these pathways indicate asymmetry between high and low levels of digital economic development. The findings enhance understanding of the complex interactions of multiple factors driving the digital economy. They also yield policy recommendations for the development of the digital economy.}

Three successive alignment models exhibit important shifts in technology strategy, competencies, and values of the organization. The three phases of incremental changes in shifting from one alignment model to the next are the emergence of new approaches, the embeddedness of these approaches in particular contexts, and their expansion to other organizational contexts.}

abstract = {Smart government aims to provide intelligent and agile personalized public services to government stakeholders. Over the past few years, governments seek to employ innovative technologies, such as blockchain, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, robotics process automation, and machine learning (ML), to improve citizens’ experiences and quality of life as well as government decision-making processes. They also aim to increase the efficiency of business processes and to transform the delivery of public services. However, the extant e-government literature lacks an inclusive digital government maturity model that can be used as a unified reference for guiding public organizations through the journey to smart government. Accordingly, the main aim of this paper is to develop a smart government maturity model by extending and revising the extant literature related to e-government. The developed model is then used to empirically evaluate the smart government initiative in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We applied the model on 41 UAE federal governments’ websites/portals and measured their maturity level using 73 indicators. The findings indicate that the UAE is quite advanced with regard to smart government, as the majority of governmental entities scored “High” and above on the use of innovative and disruptive technologies in various domains. The smart government maturity model proved its efficacy and value in evaluating the UAE’s smart government initiative.}

The banking sectors in both countries have been challenged by digitalisation pressures such as online and mobile banking, pressures from “Fintech” banks, and the automation of back-office operations. Yet, the adjustment paths in the two countries differed. In Luxembourg, there is an adjustment via limited lay-offs, and increased training and reskilling; however, in the United Kingdom, the main outcomes revolve around branch downsizing and offshoring of employment. These outcomes are explained by differences in institutional supports for collective voice institutions, as well as the role of the state. The findings demonstrate that the embedded employment relations’ institutions and actors have shaped distinct paths of adjustment to digitalisation; and show how the impact of technology on work is neither deterministic nor unidirectional.}

Drawing on a survey of chief strategy officers from 105 large listed European firms, as well as archival data, our analysis indicates that (a) the number of corporate development and strategy function employees differs substantially across firms, suggesting distinct corporate development and strategy function types and economies of scale in the corporate development and strategy function; (b) environmental, strategic, and structural factors explain this variance; and (c) the corporate development and strategy function size is consequential for a firm’s performance, although one size does not fit all firms. Overall, the study highlights the importance of strategy professionals and functions for a firm’s strategy processes.}

abstract = {A critical issue in Strategic Foresight approaches is the expected effect on the organizational and individual behavior change, as understanding, mapping, and influencing the desired future is a function of the group’s effort to adopt a more disruptive or conservative scenario in a long-term thinking and planning context. As a learning process, a Strategic Foresight experience, due to the nature of new knowledge co-creation, can foster mindset changes. However, at the same time, a Foresight project deals with the existing group assumptions due to national and organizational cultures, which can be more (or less) oriented to long-term or disruptive thinking, as well as the established managerial mentality about the future orientation in strategic thinking. These cultural assumptions can exert positive or negative influence in a Foresight mindset, and should be assessed and understood previously, as the overall cultural readiness can affect the performance of a Foresight project in general. Also, the analysis of the cultural aspect as an evaluation process can generate new learning, when compared a pre-assessment with a post-assessment. Thus, the posed question is, “How to assess cultural dimensions before and after Foresight projects?” Based on Hofstede National Cultural model, Cameron and Quinn Competing Values model, and Amsteus Managerial Foresight model, this article proposes to discuss the applicability of a three-level (national, organizational, and individual) evaluation process to assess the cultural environment readiness for Strategic Foresight projects and the influence of a Foresight project on participants’ perception of the future through a two-phase approach. This research contributes to Strategic Foresight methods by proposing a research agenda about the cultural perspective in Foresight assessment. Managerial contributions about the pre-assessment interpretations of the proposed three-level process to better understand the cultural profile of the participant group are also discussed in a hypothetical scenario application.}

Against the backdrop of the “Double Carbon” project, exploring the impact of the digital economy on green agricultural development bears tremendous practical significance. Thus, this study aims to investigate how the digital economy affects agricultural green total factor productivity (GTFP). The entropy-TOPSIS method and SBM-GML index are used to measure core variables quantitatively. In addition, two-way fixed effects panel data models, Tobit, and intermediary effect models are implemented. Three research findings emerge. First, China’s agricultural GTFP level generally experiences an upward trend, and the development of the digital economy has a significant positive effect on increasing agricultural GTFP. Second, the digital economy mainly promotes agricultural technology innovation that boosts agricultural GTFP. Third, Western China experiences a more significant positive effect of the digital economy on agricultural GTFP than Central and Eastern China. Finally, based on the findings, this paper proposes relevant policy recommendations to promote green and sustainable agriculture development.}

To achieve this, we used the QuickShift algorithm, which simplifies images’ resources, and applied it to the Open Affective Standardized Image (OASIS) dataset as well as the WikiArt Emotion dataset. Both datasets are also unified under a binary emotional system. Subsequently, a model was trained based on a convolutional neural network using OASIS as a learning base, in order to then be applied on the WikiArt Emotion dataset. The results show an improvement in the general prediction performance when applying QuickShift (73% overall). However, we can observe that artistic style influences the results, with minimalist art being incompatible with the methodology proposed.}

Although many studies have explored customers’ consumption of luxury goods, very few of these studies involved luxury hospitality services. Furthermore, hospitality literature has rarely discussed the emerging identification of inconspicuous consumption in luxury. By applying topic modeling to analyze online customer reviews, the current study identifies the essential elements of visiting luxury restaurants. Moreover, it elicits the asymmetric role of the identified factors in accelerating overall customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction through impact-asymmetry analysis, which adopts the three-factor theory. Findings suggest that many inconspicuous factors exist in luxury consumption and that the mechanisms that affect satisfaction differ among a satisfier, a dissatisfier, and a hybrid. The acknowledgment of the asymmetric effects will help practitioners in luxury restaurants enhance their understandings of customer perceptions and efficiently improve service management and marketing.}

Our empirical study consists of 422 descriptions of an entrepreneurial ideal provided by a sample of young adults, which we analysed using quantitative content analysis. The comparison between participants’ perceptions and the items captured in the gender role stereotype scales shows only a partial overlap. Although masculine qualities are mentioned, we find various androgynous (e.g., passion, team player, willingness to learn) qualities of entrepreneurs not covered in SDI, BSRI or PAQ. Based upon this, we can derive several recommendations on how established scales can be revised through future research.}

This article conducted a systematic review of all available publications from two prominent databases (WoS and Scopus) through PRISMA guidelines to explore the relationship between variables upon which the theoretical framework will be identified. Followed by semi-structured interviews with MSMEs’ eco-system stakeholders to validate the proposed framework using content analysis based on NVivo software. The findings revealed the relationship between SCMPs and CRM objectives through MSMEs’ operational performance, and a set of indicators has been determined for each variable, upon which a theoretical framework has been developed. Moreover, content analysis for interviews validates the key determinants for SCMPs, operational performance, customer satisfaction, and loyalty for MSMEs, upon which a proposed framework has been developed. This research provides a framework that can be used by academics and practitioners to assess the impact of SCMPs on CRM objectives through improving MSMEs’ operational performance and corrective action for MSMEs’ procedures.}

abstract = {After gaining membership in the European Union and NATO, models portraying Lithuania as a bridge between the East and the West, or a networked state uniting in-country nationals and global diaspora were put forth, while others even forecasted inevitable collapse in the face of a lack of a unified geopolitical program. In the light of this plethora of geopolitical visions, in 2000s Lithuania’s approach to its Eastern neighbors could have been described as “multivectoral.” While Lithuanian leaders outspokenly supported pro-democratic protests and European aspirations of the colored revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, attempts to “restart” relations with Eastern European autocrats also ensued. However, the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea really struck a chord, and the new chapter in the Russian war against Ukraine in February 2022 contributed to consolidation of a clear-cut Lithuanian geopolitical positionality. In the face of Russian aggression, squeezed between the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Russian partner-in-crime Belarus, Lithuania rebranded itself as an outpost of a global democratizing agenda and embraced a discourse of care vis-à-vis repressed Russian and Belarusian civil societies and Ukrainians fighting back for national survival. Echoing historical solidarity narratives of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, new-found Lithuanian agency also aims to reframe Russian aggression as a neo-colonial performance. This piece (1) explores how the unfolding war has constituted a “democratic outpost” identity espoused by the Lithuanian political elite and (2) links these shifts with increased Lithuanian agency in Euro-Atlantic structures and the unexpected attempts to rework itself as a hub of democracy promotion globally. Finally, (3) the contribution problematizes the “outpost Europe” idea by scrutinizing the telling silence on the creeping autocratization in Poland, and the implicit paternalism of the pro-democratic care targeting Russian, Belarusian civil societies, and the Ukrainian state.}

abstract = {The article investigates organisational drivers and restrainers of innovation in hospitals on the background of different institutional logics. It presents evidence from a multiple case study in Polish hospitals, which reveals different dynamics on the micro-, meso- and macro-level of organisations in enabling and implementing new procedures and technologies. In particular, the study documents an ambiguous influence of medical professionalism as a specific logic in the healthcare sector, which can affect innovation positively as well as negatively. The article therefore proposes a managerial framework based in innovation action commitment to control the effects of professionalism in healthcare.}

abstract = {Succession planning is important for organizational growth and business sustainability in the public sector. However, few organizations have attempted to introduce the concept and practice. This article aimed to identify and prioritize the factors that influence executive succession planning in the public sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), using the analytic hierarchy process. A model was developed with 5 criteria and 29 sub-criteria and tested using data collected from 40 interviews with top executives from various public sector organizations. The findings showed that succession planning strategy, organizational culture and leadership development opportunities were the most significant factors linked to executive succession planning in the UAE public sector. A framework for decision-makers was developed which could be used to overcome some of the challenges of executive succession planning. It is hoped that this study will help policymakers to formulate suitable policies and strategies to promote executive succession planning in public sector organizations. It will also help them to implement best practice in this field.}

We specifically discuss how various crowd-related phenomena and practices—for example, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, user innovation, and peer production—relate to theories of the firm, with particular attention on “sociality” in firms and markets. We first briefly review extant theories of the firm and then discuss three theoretical aspects of sociality related to crowds in the context of strategy, organizations, and innovation: (1) the functions of sociality (sociality as extension of rationality, sociality as sensing and signaling, sociality as matching and identity), (2) the forms of sociality (independent/aggregate and interacting/emergent forms of sociality), and (3) the failures of sociality (misattribution and misapplication). We conclude with an outline of future research directions and introduce the special issue papers and essays.}

Despite the agreement on the business model’s role in innovation and firm success, this concept is unnoticed in the legal industry. The growing digitalization has disrupted the legal industry business model by enabling various cooperation, collaboration, value proposition, and value capture mechanism. Digitalization has innovated the legal business model and engaged them in the mundane adaptation in response to external environment changes. However, literature trends reveal that innovation in the legal business model is overlooked by academia. This study applied a case study method to highlight business model innovation in legal firms in the proposed framework of the business model navigator/magic triangle and business model canvas. We also took the market and industry trends and COVID-19 into consideration in the legal business landscape. This study proposed a digital business model and innovation operating model for the legal firms based on the identified fundamental pillars of digital business model components. This study expands the literature on digitalization and business model innovation by focusing on an ignored industry with substantial disruptive potential.}

Ideally, sketches and drawings are useful in illustrating complexity and multiple abstracts from observed social reality. The use of illustrations allows novice qualitative researchers to explore observed social reality in depth with less linear insight. However, few scholars mention the use of illustrations at the research planning stage because most sketches and drawings have been used as tools during data collection merely to understand an interviewee’s perspective. Therefore, this article aims to demonstrate the use of illustrations as a tool to facilitate the research process from problem identification to the selection of the qualitative research methodology. Five specific purposes of illustration that significantly contribute to the body of knowledge for effective decision making and are useful tools in delivering information are demonstrated in this article. Based on the illustrations demonstrated in this article, the most appropriate qualitative research methodology is the case study. Overall, the proposed use of illustrations can assist a novice qualitative researcher in determining the appropriate epistemological and ontological stances, as well as their methodology and method, more effectively.}

Comparing the federal level in the United States (Anglo-Saxon public interest culture) and in Austria (continental European rule-of-law culture), this article looks at how different barriers to digital government were affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Fourteen semi-structured interviews with experts in United States departments and their Austrian counterparts are conducted. The results show strong similarities between the United States and Austria in cultural barriers (bureaucratic culture, resistance to change, risk aversion) but also in structural barriers (political commitment and resources, workforce) to digital government. The main difference lies in laws and regulations as structural barriers, stemming from the different administrative traditions. Furthermore, the study highlights the dynamic nature of barriers. It shows that a crisis can result in the lowering of both structural as well as cultural barriers. Deliberate removal of structural barriers in experimentation spaces may therefore enhance digital government in “orderly” times as well. Points for practitioners Knowing how to overcome certain barriers is essential in innovation processes. This study shows that windows of opportunity can be opened by a crisis, but also provides key learnings for policy measures that can be taken in “orderly” times. Public administrations require space where structural barriers are deliberately removed in order to experiment and learn, which can lower cultural barriers to digital government as well.}

Based on unique survey data from 1,444 German firms with and without family influence, we reveal that knowledge exploitation, risk management, and marketing capabilities mediate the positive relationship between family influence and digital BMI. Surprisingly, and contrary to our assumption, we find that the positive relationship between family influence and dynamic capabilities is weakened rather than strengthened by environmental dynamism. Our findings hold important implications for family business innovation and digital BMI research, offering valuable insights into the role of dynamic capabilities and environmental dynamism in the digital economy.}

abstract = {There are several sustainability issues that the linear economy of today’s society cannot adequately tackle (i.e. resource depletion, waste treatment, etc.). As a result, the scientific community and policymakers give high priority to the implementation of the circular economy concept. The sustainable development goals of the United Nations are in line with the European Union’s (EU) commitment to a smooth transition to a circular economy. Circular business models require a shift in technical elements involving R strategies to replace traditional business models (i.e. reuse, reduce, recycle, etc.). Monitoring circular economy to provide quantifiable, measurable data is necessary for a successful transition. Monitoring tools (i.e. Key Performance Indicators, quality protocols) enable decision-makers to measure circular economy performance and identify circularity’s advantages and disadvantages. To stimulate the adoption of a circularity model addressing critical issues of excessive waste production and resource use, this mini review aims to address the literature gap of waste metrics in the framework of circular economy and offer insights on circular economy indicators to aid for a seamless transition to a more sustainable society. For this purpose, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis method was chosen to assess literature. The authors collected and analysed data from 101 records, 70 articles and 31 reports related to the topic under consideration. Through the literature review, it is obvious that moving away from linear production model frequently leads to the development of new internal capabilities along the value chain and, eventually, high efficiency that reduces costs, increasing productivity, encourages brand names, minimizes threats, creates new products and fulfils regulations and green consumer expectations.}

abstract = {The emergence of “big data” offers organizations unprecedented opportunities to gain and maintain competitive advantage. Trying to exploit the strategic business potential embedded in big data, many organizations have started to renovate their business models or develop new ones, giving rise to the phenomenon of big-data business models. Although big-data business model research is still in its infancy, a significant number of studies on the topic have been published since 2014. We thus suggest it is time to perform a critical review and assessment of the literature at the intersection of business models and big data (analytics), thereby responding to recent calls for further research on and sustained analysis of big-data business models. In particular, our review uses three major criteria (big-data business model types, dimensions, and deployment) to assess the state of the big-data business model literature and identify shortcomings in this literature. On this basis, we derive and discuss five central research perspectives (supply chain, stakeholder, ethics, national, and process), providing guidance for future research and theory development in the area. These perspectives also have practical implications on how to address the current big-data business model deployment gap.}

Objective: The aim of this study is twofold, to develop a virtual patients model for lumbar decompression surgery and to evaluate the precision of an artificial neural network (ANN) model designed to accurately predict the clinical outcomes of lumbar decompression surgery. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of complete Electronic Health Records (EHR) to identify potential unfavorable criteria for spine surgery (predictors). A cohort of synthetics EHR was created to classify patients by surgical success (green zone) or partial failure (orange zone) using an Artificial Neural Network which screens all the available predictors. Results: In the actual cohort, we included 60 patients, with complete EHR allowing efficient analysis, 26 patients were in the orange zone (43.4%) and 34 were in the green zone (56.6%). The average positive criteria amount for actual patients was 8.62 for the green zone (SD+/- 3.09) and 10.92 for the orange zone (SD 3.38). The classifier (a neural network) was trained using 10,000 virtual patients and 2000 virtual patients were used for test purposes. The 12,000 virtual patients were generated from the 60 EHR, of which half were in the green zone and half in the orange zone. The model showed an accuracy of 72% and a ROC score of 0.78. The sensitivity was 0.885 and the specificity 0.59. Conclusion: Our method can be used to predict a favorable patient to have lumbar decompression surgery. However, there is still a need to further develop its ability to analyze patients in the “failure of treatment” zone to offer precise management of patient health before spinal surgery.}

abstract = {Continuous innovation is one of the effective ways to enhance the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While the contribution of data, a new production factor, to enhance continuous innovation performance is widely recognized, little is known about the mechanisms through which data empowers continuous innovation in SMEs. This study focuses on the under-explored issue of how data empowers SMEs to achieve continuous innovation. It applies the theoretical lens of empowerment to explain the process by which SMEs transform data resources into continuous innovation capabilities. Drawing on a multiple case study of four Chinese SMEs (including 15 semi-structured interviews, archival materials, and observations) through theoretical sampling, our materials were coded and analyzed based on the Gioia methodology. The results show that (1) SMEs can build digital platforms to break down organizational boundaries, allowing external stakeholders such as customers and suppliers to directly participate in innovation activities and leveraging data to directly propel innovation activities. Such SMEs usually adopt disruptive innovation. (2) SMEs can broaden and deepen their product expertise by collecting and analyzing data from customer feedback and data generated during production, and eliminate data silos between departments through data flow, thus achieving incremental improvements in products or technologies. These SMEs usually adopt incremental innovation. Based on these findings, we propose a theoretical model under the guidance of empowerment theory to demonstrate two distinct processes for data empowering continuous innovation in SMEs. Finally, we discuss our study’s implications for data empowerment and continuous innovation research and provide future research directions. We also offer some suggestions for SMEs seeking continuous innovation. On the one hand, SMEs should choose a continuous innovation route that suits them according to their resource acquisition capabilities. On the other hand, SMEs in related industries should jointly develop digital platforms, thus expanding the scope of data empowerment and promoting continuous innovation.}

Smart airports utilize new connected technologies to improve end-user experience while ensuring operational feasibility in aeronautical and non-aeronautical segments. The increasing need for digitizing the design-build-operate life cycles of airports can be met by implementing building information modeling (BIM) that enables accessing, managing, utilizing, and connecting physical and operational data in a digital collaborative environment. This study investigates the current state of practice in airport BIM (ABIM) and the use of ABIM processes in digital airport operations and maintenance by connecting existing data sources and integrating smart airport systems. The study proposes a comprehensive and adaptive ABIM management framework that depicts the alignment and connectivity of ABIM processes, resources and stakeholders with airport operational requirements by identifying gaps in the industry and literature, and developing a global understanding in ABIM visions. Research data are collected through literature and industry review, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews with aviation professionals. Mixed methods including non-parametric statistical analysis and qualitative analysis are used to determine the elements of the framework. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) principles and language are used to generate the framework. For framework validation, a proof of concept (POC) is conducted by development and deployment of a web-based application. The developed ABIM framework is expected to guide major airport stakeholders in their BIM implementation processes to enhance airport operational efficiencies and in strategizing digital initiatives on a connected-BIM platform.}

abstract = {In this Dialog, seven scholars consider the theoretical implications and research opportunities a changing environment presents for the Attention-Based View (ABV). With its roots in the 1950s Carnegie School, ABV is expanding and evolving in ways that accommodate the changes in the corporate context characterized by distributed, porous structures of organizational networks such as ecosystems and platforms. The authors emphasize a shift toward a more dynamic orientation of this research, one that addresses the challenges of sustaining coherent attention and sensemaking, a shift from quantity to quality of attention, and how corporate communications ranging from formalized strategy presentations to less formal social media communications can spin attention in ways that lead to intended as well as unintended outcomes. Emerging organizational trends open up radically different perspectives on attention: today’s superstar firms draw new kinds of attention and many new business models are based upon the attraction and selling of customer attention.}

abstract = {The research aims to explore the technological, environmental and organizational factors that influence digital technology adoption in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sector in developing countries. A conceptual framework is proposed that combines the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory to explore the determinants of digital technology, for example, information and communication technology (ICT) applicability in SMEs. In addition, this study identifies the major barriers to implementing ICT in the SMEs sector. A purposive 535 sample was accumulated from higher- and middle-level managers of SMEs firms through a structured questionnaire. Data and hypotheses were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. Results show that relative advantage, complexity, observability, perceived cost, top management support, innovativeness of top management, competitive pressure and government support have significant determinants of ICT adoption in SMEs. Besides, compatibility, perceived trialability and organization readiness have not significantly influenced to use of ICT in SMEs. This research has crucial implications for practising managers, policymakers and SMEs business owners. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is perhaps one of the first empirical surveys that widely provides a theoretical framework regarding ICT adoption in SMEs in Bangladesh.}

The present results indicate that the design of a strategic planning process, transformation programme and roadmap of prioritised improvement initiatives can enable human resource management (HRM) functions to scale their operating model into the future. Furthermore, the flexibility of the DMADV methodology means that the proposed model may be applied in any function outside of HR and indeed may be of interest to private organisations seeking to develop a similar programme of change.}

The results of the research revealed the importance of access to information and communication technologies for both students and teachers: 67.9% of the participating students were found to have Internet connection and 69.1% a computer in their homes, while 80.3% of the students were observed to use a computer outside the school, but 19.7% were not. The results also showed that 64.6% of the students have Internet connection in their classrooms, but 29.2% of these students do not use the Internet in the classroom, whereas 8.9% use it in the classroom all the time. The rate of students using a digital device for reading is 38.1%, while that of those not using one is 61.9%. Some 32.1% of secondary school students were revealed not to have Internet connection at home. Additionally, 77% of teachers were not trained in online teaching prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the findings, teachers can be suggested to develop projects – i.e., of TUBITAK, E-twinning, and Erasmus – which potentially encourage students to use information and communication technologies so that both teachers and students can benefit from them. It is also suggested that the Ministry of National Education should work on improving the information communication technology competencies of teachers and students. Besides, policies should be developed to eliminate regional differences in terms of access to digital resources and technology in terms of equal opportunities and opportunities.}

abstract = {Abstract Social media marketing has garnered a lot of attention in recent times. Regulators, however, do not have any established frameworks to exert a level of control on social media marketing activities. Furthermore, some research studies have shown that control at an organizational level does not appear to be either formal or particularly strong. There are other areas that require investigation as well, such as confusion on the use of personal accounts for marketing the organizations’ products and services, the pressure of releasing media content at speed and the possibility of misuse of any information that is disseminated. There is no doubt social media is an attractive channel for marketing purposes given its free usage and scale of adoption by consumers; however, there is a considerable risk it can be misused as well. Hence, it can be argued that strong control systems should be in place. The case of multiple fatalities in a mob-lynching in India, allegedly as a result of the so-called “fake news” being disseminated via the social media platform Whatsapp, has caught the attention of the Indian government, which is seeking to exert more control over social media channels. Thus, this article critically examines the issue of control over social media marketing in India, and makes suggestions for the creation of a robust control and regulatory framework for the same. This study broadens our understanding of the roles of regulatory framework in social media marketing context.}

Our research provides evidence for policy design by presenting the results of a Policy Delphi study focused on business model and market design adaptation alternatives. We highlight the importance of supporting innovation and a more proactive approach to adaptation from both distribution system operators and regulators. Our findings support the importance of electricity distribution for neutral market facilitation, contributing to market development and enabling new market players.

However, with more than a century of application, the compelling nexus between photography and physical evidence has no clear theoretical framework that explains this pivotal relationship. From a pragmatic perspective, this article proposes a new theoretical framework that focuses on the reliability of photographic evidence as the central theme of the model. It provides a description of physical evidence as various modes of inquiry and introduces the concept that photographic evidence reliability should-be considered based on the source of the photographic material. The theoretical framework introduces taxonomical descriptors of photographic evidence including: (1) analyse, (2) document, (3) describe (visual narrative), and (4) witness forms of photographic modes of inquiry. Visual culture intellectual John Berger said: “At one level there are no photographs which can be denied. All photographs have a status of fact. What has to be examined is in what way photography can and cannot give meaning to facts.” This article will examine the critical concepts regarding how photographic evidence can be considered as reliable when used as physical evidence.}

Rather than examining the mechanics of this process, social science predominantly conceives political polarization in a rather static manner and measures its prevalence and causes within and between societies. This article views political polarization as taking shape in the experience of political conflict. It proposes a cultural performance framework suitable to examine the social drama of political conflict and its connections to interpersonal political dispute. Performative polarization is premised upon antagonizing one public in order to win over and energize another public. It views political antagonism as constituted by (1) powerful performers and performances that provide the preparatory symbolic work and scripts and (2) divided publics who arbitrate their dramatic acts in ensuing performances and who collectively generate political divisions. The anti-Critical Race Theory campaign in the USA serves as a case study to work through the elements of this theoretical framework.}

abstract = {Service frontline encounters between customers and service providers have been subject to fundamental changes in recent years. As two major change agents, technology infusion and data privacy regulations are inextricably linked and constitute a critical ethical and societal issue. Specifically, service frontlines—as represented by human or technological agents, or some hybrid form—rely on customer data for service provision, which subjects them to privacy regulations governing the collection, submission, access, and use of any customer data thus captured. However, scant research outlines the significant implications of evolving data privacy regulations for service frontline encounters. To advance knowledge in this domain, this research distills six key dimensions of global data privacy regulations (fairness, data limits, transparency, control, consent, and recourse). Employing an intelligences theoretical lens, the authors theorize how these dimensions might become differentially manifest across three service frontline interface types (human-based, technology-based, and hybrid). Carefully intersecting the need for varying intelligences across data privacy regulatory dimensions with the abilities of service frontline interfaces to harness each intelligence type, this study offers a novel conceptual framework that advances research and practice. Theoretical, managerial, and policy implications unfold from the proposed framework, which also can inform a future research agenda.}

This qualitative study is conducted based on grounded theory, using Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) as a framework for blockchain adoption drivers in Thailand, as identified from in-depth interviews with blockchain experts of 12 Thai financial and supply chain organizations. The findings have shown that operational efficiency, suitable application, supportive governmental policies and regulations, and stakeholders’ cooperation are newly emerged TOE factors, and that each of the focussed sectors weighs environmental factors differently due to naturally different goals and the business model of each sector, which ultimately guides the future adopters in blockchain adoption.}

Nowadays, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions have exerted an outrageous impact on small businesses survival. In developing countries where government-supporting capacity is low, the severity is substantial. The present study predicts the impact of COVID-19 lockdown restriction and government supporting schemes on small business survival. To meet this purpose, the study primarily used PLS-SEM and binary logit models. The results confirmed that over 44% of small businesses would fail in the first month of lockdown restriction. Moreover, only 6% have cash reserve to survive twelve months. In this regard, the present study suggested that the government should have to abstain from total lockdown measures, without government-supporting schemes. As such, the study has examined the relative importance of COVID-19 based special loan, suspension of payments, withdrawal of restricted funds, and exemption of tax and penalty payments. Among these supporting schemes, COVID-19 based special loan is the most important government-supporting scheme followed by the suspension of interest and principal payments. However, the exemption of tax payments and withdrawal of restricted funds were not significant.}

In the field of social marketing, digital marketing is considered important, but has been mainly used to raise awareness of social causes. Focus of the Article This paper considers the conceptualization of a model to conduct the conversion of behavior change, using both offline and digital marketing techniques. Research Question The paper seeks to investigate existing research on how digital marketing concepts can be integrated into a social marketing strategy. Approach The proposed conceptual model follows the process of the stages of change and considers the theoretical social marketing frameworks, applying the assumptions of citizens’ journey and the use of adequate digital and physical touchpoints to convert behavior. Importance to the Social Marketing Field The model offers theoretical advances for social marketing, going beyond the stage of raising awareness of social causes in social networks, and integrates the assumptions of an omnichannel strategy for social marketing interventions focused on behavior change conversion. Methods The paper follows the benchmark method of theories to build a conceptual model. Results The Omnichannel Social Marketing Model Through Stages of Change presents adequate digital and physical marketing techniques for the different stages of the social change process. Recommendations for Research or Practice The model can be used in future research to measure the effectiveness of social marketing, considering the inclusion of digital technologies and marketing techniques in social marketing strategy. The model also guides social marketing managers in using both digital and offline marketing techniques in an integrated and strategic manner for effective and long-term conversion of change. Future research can apply the model to social marketing cases to generalize its application. Limitations The conceptual model is designed in a bottom-up approach, based on the literature review.}

abstract = {The widely used socioecological rainbow model from Dahlgren and Whitehead specifies determinants of health inequity on multiple hierarchical levels and suggests that these determinants may interact both within and between levels. At the time of its inception, digital determinants only played a minor role in tackling inequities in public health and were therefore not specifically considered. This has dramatically changed: From today’s perspective, health inequities increasingly depend on digital determinants. In this article, we suggest adapting the Dahlgren-Whitehead model to reflect these developments. We propose a model that allows formulating testable hypotheses, interpreting research findings, and developing policy implications against the background of the global spread of digital technologies. This may facilitate the development of a new line of research and logic models for public health interventions in the digital age. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we illustrate how the digitization of all aspects of life affects the different levels of determinants of health inequities in the Dahlgren–Whitehead model. In doing so, we deliberately argue for not introducing a separate digital sphere in its own right, but for understanding digitization as a phenomenon that permeates all levels of determinants of health inequities. As a result, we present a digital rainbow model that integrates Dahlgren and Whitehead’s 1991 model with digital environments to identify current health promotion and research issues without changing the rainbow model’s initial structure.}

Based on 313 survey responses from citizens in Bahrain, the top-ranked country in information and communications technology adoption in the Gulf Cooperation Council region, we test government performance and transparency as mediators between transformation of government and citizen trust. The resulting preliminary insights on the measurement and manifestation of citizen trust in the context of information and communications technology-enabled transformation of government have multiple policy implications and extend our understanding of how information and communications technology-enabled transformation of government can improve the government–citizen relationship and digital services adoption. Points for practitioners To fundamentally change the core functions of government, information and communications technology-enabled transformation of government must move beyond the simple digitization and web enabling of processes. Information and communications technology-enabled transformation of government has the potential to address declining citizen trust in government by improving transparency and performance. The success of information and communications technology-enabled transformation of government in Bahrain is attributable to its small size and demographic composition, the relative maturity of digital government initiatives, and the complete commitment of the government to information and communications technology-enabled transformation of government.}

abstract = {This study aims to explore how small and medium-sized platforms in the sharing economy can gain a competitive advantage in a market monopolized by giants. Taking China’s ride-hailing industry as an example, the k-means clustering method was employed to compare and analyze the characteristics and differences of 207 small and medium-sized platforms based on the framework of the business model canvas. An empirical typology comprising four representative successful business models of small and medium-sized ride-hailing platforms is extracted from the dimensions of key partners, value propositions, customer segmentation, and cost-revenue structure: high-end business platforms, Minibus-hailing platforms, Intercity carpool platforms, and Aggregation mode platforms. The results show that small and medium-sized platforms in the sharing economy can rely on their own characteristics and advantages to seek new potential development directions and gain development space by constructing value propositions and operating models that are different from industry giants. Specifically, it is necessary to further implement refined market identification and segmentation to continuously develop differentiated competitive advantages. In particular, more effective and open business strategies should be explored and practiced to greatly expand the network effects and business boundaries of small and medium-sized platforms, thereby significantly enhancing their competitiveness in the ride-hailing market. This study provides a new perspective on the reconstruction of market exchange in the sharing economy through the prism of small and medium-sized digital platforms and has certain important theoretical significance for supplementing and advancing existing research.}

The data, collected through a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews with 32 learners, were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis (i.e., template analysis). Based on an in-depth analysis of the data using NVIVO 10, the authors propose and apply the “PERI” model to develop multi-focal insights into gamification and its influences on student learning. The model proposed is original and comprehensive, encompassing (1) Preferabilities (P), (2) Experiences (E), (3) Recommendations (R), and (4) Impressions (I). Although most of the findings were positive with regard to application and receptivity across all dimensions of the PERI model for the gamification tool—a game-based student response system (GSRS) used for delivering education—they also reveal areas in need of development for the successful embedding of gamifying technology–enhanced learning provisions and their efficacy in teaching and learning pedagogy. The conclusions of this study outline implications for educators, students, education leaders, and gamification product developers.}

abstract = {Circular entrepreneurship is becoming a new, promising reality, in the manner of needed radical paradigmatic change in the era of Anthropocene. Circular entrepreneurs intend to create social and environmental value while they build financially viable businesses. They are embedded in multiple institutionalised value systems that they are expected to adhere to. Those institutionalised systems provide circular entrepreneurs with different, in many cases, contradictory norms, values and guiding principles. Substantial amount of research has been done to date to examine the impact of institutions on entrepreneurial endeavours. And yet, research lacks sufficient insights into how circular entrepreneurs engage with the institutional structures in designing business models on a financially feasible ground while creating social and environmental value. To address this, this paper investigates how circular entrepreneurs respond to the value systems of surrounding institutions in business modelling and how two fundamental aspects of embeddedness, namely resource integration and value cocreation, are achieved within a circular business model that is coherent in itself and with the entrepreneur’s ambitions. Both the institutional context and the institutional logics surrounding entrepreneurs are examined to comprehend the surrounding institutional systems more in-depth and extensively. By analysing a longitudinal in-depth case study, this article aims to develop better insights into circular business modelling and underlying mechanisms of embeddedness. The case is a born-circular small cidermaker in Cornwall (UK), namely Wasted Apple. The findings show that the circular entrepreneur is surrounded by dominant normative institutions forming the principles of business model design. circular entrepreneurs mark fidelity to the institutional norms to obtain a range of microcompetencies and to manage integrated hybrid tensions within the value creation system. And therefore, a circular business model is a more holistic and inclusive structure as compared to a typical conventional linear business model. And yet, paradoxically embeddedness facilitates business survival but hinders strategic business planning as well as business profitability and growth.}

The sudden need for digital solutions across the field of education resulted in the emergence of a variety of digital networks and collaborative online platforms. In this joint article from scholars around Europe, we explore the Covid-19 lockdowns of physical education across the European region, and the different processes of emergency digitalization that followed in their wake. Spanning perspectives from Italy, Germany, Belgium, and the Nordic countries, the article’s five cases provide a glimpse of how these processes have at the same time accelerated and consolidated the involvement of various commercial and non-commercial actors in public education infrastructures. By gathering documentation, registering dynamics, and making intimations of the crisis as it unfolded, the aim of the joint paper is to provide an opportunity for considering the implications of these accelerations and consolidations for the heterogeneous futures of European education.}

A framework and visualisation were developed, capturing unexplored heterogeneity within these start-ups, depending whether the emphasis was upon opportunities or adversity, and the type and extent of business model changes. Six start-up types were identified: stable beneficiaries, business-as-usual continuers, digital adjusters, adversity survivors, opportunity graspers and lemonade makers. The findings suggest that most start-ups responded to the crisis through business model changes because of crisis-induced opportunities and crisis-induced adversity The anaysis found that the interplay between firm size and crisis influences whether start-ups focus on business model adaptation or business model innovation or a combination of both We thus contribute to the literature on business models, crisis management and a newly emerging field focusing on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for start-ups.}

This article is an attempt to reflect on the peculiar nature of new digital resources, their relation to conventional method integration problems, and the practical opportunities for making the digital relevant to ethnographic field studies. These reflections are grounded in the authors’ trials and tribulations during an ethnographic project, in which a deliberate attempt was made to combine digital methods with traditional ethnographic methods. This involved wrestling with a series of methodological issues, which were eventually managed by developing an approach called the slalom method. The slalom method consists of a series of rules and heuristics that together constitutes a pragmatic strategy for facilitating the integration of digital resources into the iterative and reflexive process of an ethnographic field study.}

In this article, we introduce review research as a class of research inquiries that uses prior research as data sources to develop knowledge contributions for academia, practice and policy. We first trace the evolution of review research both outside of and within management including the articles published in this Feature Topic, and provide a holistic definition of review research. Then, we argue that in the plurality of forms of review research, the alignment of purpose and methods is crucial for high-quality review research. To accomplish this, we discuss several review purposes and criteria for assessing review research’s rigor and impact, and discuss how these and the review methods need to be aligned with its purpose. Our paper provides guidance for conducting or evaluating review research and helps establish review research as a credible and legitimate scientific endeavor.}

At the theoretical level, the impact mechanism of the digital economy empowering green transformation in the manufacturing industry is hypothesized. The relevant hypotheses were tested through econometric empirical evidence, and the econometric model significantly passed the robustness test, proving that the digital economy empowers the development of green transformation in the manufacturing industry significantly. This article reveals that the digital economy promotes the green total factor productivity of enterprises by enhancing their innovation capability, improving the efficiency of production factor flow, and increasing their emission costs, but the factor intensity and the nature of enterprise owners will have different effects on the green transformation of the manufacturing industry enabled by the digital economy. This article explores the internal mechanism of green transformation development in the digital economy-enabled manufacturing industry and provides empirical evidence for enterprises to formulate development strategies and for governments to issue guiding policies.}

The present study evaluated the levels and influence of computer anxiety and digital readiness for academic engagement among undergraduate students. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 272 medical students enrolled in a medicine program. Two previously validated instruments were adopted. We examined the association between students’ sociodemographic variables, internet use, and perceived academic performance during e-learning and their computer anxiety and digital readiness. The results show a significant effect of gender, age, and internet use on students’ computer anxiety and digital readiness. Males’ information-sharing behavior and skills outperformed those of females, and students’ computer anxiety decreased with increasing age. In addition, the results indicate that the greater the students’ internet use, the better their digital readiness for academic engagement. Furthermore, computer anxiety and digital readiness affect students’ perceptions of their academic performance in e-learning. The rapid rate of technological advancements and the integration of e-learning into education means that careful attention must be paid to student characteristics as well as their skills. This will allow educators to create a successful, personalized learning framework.}

Transforming services and internal operations through the use of information and communication technologies frequently requires the engagement of multiple stakeholders beyond government agencies. This is particularly important in the specific case of smart city initiatives, which intend to leverage technologies to address complex socio-economic and sustainability challenges in local jurisdictions. In addition, emergent research asserts that community organizations such as public libraries can be strategic partners in these multi-actor efforts but does not adequately assess the determinants of these collaborations for developing smart cities, which may result in significant digital transformation at the local level. Based on public management literature on collaboration, this article contributes to digital transformation research by quantitively testing the antecedents of existing collaborations between public libraries and other stakeholders to develop smart cities. Overall, our findings suggest that leadership, preexisting relationships, and agreement on initial aims significantly impact the extent and effectiveness of public libraries’ collaborations in developing smart cities.}

abstract = {Real-time bidding (RTB), which holds bids for advertisers to choose when and where to display their advertisements with desired budgets, is one way to improve effectiveness. We proposed supply side platform (SSP) and demand side platform (DSP) to integrate supplier side and demand side as solution. The proposed method combines two digital technology service, gamified RTB and mobile location-based analysis (LBA). In order to make target customers make interactions actively with the advertisement contents, the idea of gamification is employed to increase customer participation. By the coupons in the gamifying RTB App, it have increased the coupon usage rate of 16.7% and 11.6% in the restaurant and apparel industries. It is a successfully digital transformation marketing service for retail industries. The gamified RTB plays an important role in making old business circles accept new technologies for the renewal of promotion strategies and help find the business directions in the future.}

To ensure that ecological balance is maintained, the United Nations has developed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study attempts to meet the 12th SDG of “responsible production and consumption” and provide a guideline to manufacturing organizations in Pakistan. Many scholars have examined the role of different technologies on sustainable performance. However, research using eco-innovation (EI), digital transformation (DT), and smart technologies (ST) is still scarce. The current study develops the conceptual model based on the resource-based view (RBV) and technology, organization, and environment (TOE) theories, and using a simple random sampling technique, valid data from 375 professionals in the manufacturing industry is collected to test the relationship between sustainable development strategy (SDS), EI, DT, ST, and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). The results indicate strong positive relationships between SDS, EI, DT, ST, and SSCP. Results indicate that even if organizations are executing SDS and EI, without DT and ST, organizations cannot achieve SSCP. Therefore, it is recommended to the managers that they must apply DT and ST to guarantee their pursuit of achieving sustainable performance and contribution toward SDGs.}

The literature on DT enablers suggests sensitivity to the organizational context, especially to the technology intensity of companies. This article analyzes the variations in non-technological DT enablers in high-tech and low-tech manufacturing companies. Through a systematic literature review, using coding techniques and cluster analysis, we created 20 aggregated enabler categories. With the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, clustered DT enablers in high-tech and low-tech companies were compared. High-tech companies enable DT with the factors related primarily to organizational flexibility and dynamism. In contrast, low-tech firms propel DT with the enablers connected to more stable, traditional, managerial practices. JEL Classification: 031 and 032}

The present study sheds light on the emergence of enablers and inhibitors, explaining technological readiness insight for ERP adoption. The study aims to understand better ERP readiness among HEIs to ease the substantial change required for the adoption process. The findings show a profound perception of ERP systems among 112 Egyptian HEIs, demonstrating that HEIs are technologically ready for adoption. Results reveal that HEIs have positive ERP readiness, although HEIs’ managers are still uncertain and expect some ERP inhibitors. Therefore, ERP adoption is principally contingent on perceiving enablers and eliminating any inhibitors comprising ERP technological readiness. This study delivers practical verification to the higher education context by advancing ERP concepts and characteristics from the HEIs’ perspective. This study, finally, suggests that ERP adoption is beneficial for HEIs}

By critically discussing both opportunities and shortcomings of how European PSM organisations developed their online services and personalisation systems, we argue that in their own platformisation processes, PSM have partially lost their distinctiveness and have not been able to provide viable alternatives to the dominant audiovisual media platforms. Thus, building on Mouffe’s agonistic theory and Illich’s conviviality theory, this article proposes a theoretical framework to radically rethink the guiding principles and rationales driving public service platforms, in order to develop viable alternatives to the currently dominant models. By doing so, we envision the development of such services as convivial tools that are based on three principles, namely, symmetry of power (intended as hackability, openness and algorithmic conviviality), independence and environmental sustainability.}

In particular, there is a lack of sound empirical success factor-related studies that take into account the municipal mission of creating public value, as well as future-oriented strategic measures by which municipally owned companies can be directed from a municipal perspective. Therefore, this study examines strategic success factors that have an impact on the perceived success of municipally owned companies by investigating the responses from 271 qualified key informants using structural equation modelling. The analysis of the responses indicates that three factors (shared vision, strategic coordination and goal clarity) show a positive significant impact on the perceived success of municipally owned companies. In summary, the study provides insights to academics and public officials, and contributes to address the prevailing gap of empirical knowledge in the field. Points for practitioners The findings suggest that creating a shared vision and building a common understanding with their municipally owned companies concerning their goals, roles and duties is an important task for municipalities. Furthermore, the results indicate that municipalities that take an active part in their ownership role are more likely to experience enhanced municipally owned company success than others that instead rely on contractual agreements. Thus, creating a joint understanding of the intended strategy and operations seems more promising than creating excessive bureaucratic burdens.}

We have adjoined these two theoretical models for the following reasons, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have combined ECM with affordance theory. The study followed a survey method, and a total of 466 respondents were contacted. The model was tested using the structural equation modelling technique through the Partial Least square method. The research study highlights a model with three layers of relationships with affordances triggering the expectations about the utility and usability of e-learning technologies. Furthermore, the findings of this study has indicated that all the proposed hypotheses are supported. Specifically, this study has reported that perceived usefulness is found to be a key variable that plays an essential role in determining the success of online learning platforms. Subsequently, the study offers a theoretical narrative for user satisfaction and loyalty toward e-learning platforms in light of the ECM and the Affordance Theory. The findings of this study offer critical insights for content creators and app designers on user experience design for e-learning apps that would eventually help to devise better teaching-learning strategies in technology-mediated learning environments.}

abstract = {Cognitive automation (CA) moves beyond rule-based business process automation to target cognitive knowledge and service work. This allows the automation of tasks and processes, for which automation seemed unimaginable a decade ago. To organizations, these CA use cases offer vast opportunities to gain a significant competitive advantage. However, CA imposes novel challenges on organizations’ decisions regarding the automation potential of use cases, resulting in low adoption and high project failure rates. To counteract this, we draw on an action research study with a leading European manufacturing company to develop and test a model for assessing use cases’ amenability to CA. The proposed model comprises four dimensions: cognition, data, relationship, and transparency requirements. The model proposes that a use case is less (more) amenable to CA if these requirements are high (low). To account for the model’s industry-agnostic generalizability, we draw on an internal evaluation within the action research company and three additional external evaluations undertaken by independent project teams in three distinct industries. From a practice perspective, the model will help organizations make more informed decisions in selecting use cases for CA and planning their respective initiatives. From a research perspective, the identified determinants affecting use cases’ amenability to CA will enhance our understanding of CA in particular and artificial intelligence as the driving force behind CA in general.}

Concepts of holism are common in contemporary and new age management settings, but are largely undertheorized by organizational scholars; moreover, the relations between holism and techno-culture, increasingly recognized by digital sociologists, are largely missing from organizational scholarship. Using the lens of “communicative capitalism,” we carry out a case study of “HappyAppy,” a French techno-startup association concerned with well-being related applications, to understand how holistic ideas are deployed and shaped within this association. We find that that holism is marked, on the one hand, by “autarkic” fantasies, involving subjective integration and immersion, and on the other, by “relational” fantasies, involving interpersonal connection and participation. Moreover, each of these versions of holism is associated with distinct critical possibilities. We use these results to theorize the role of digital holism at the intersection of new age management and digital culture, outlining an agenda for future research.}

The objective of this work is to theorize the idea of continuous development in the context of digital infrastructure evolution and explore the organizational interactions underlying continuous development. By drawing on literature on digital infrastructure theory and continuous development as it has emerged as an idea from the DevOps thinking expanded from agile, we outline main characteristics of continuous development and propose a theoretical definition of continuous development in organizational contexts. Then, in answering our research question “which patterns of interactions can be identified in the continuous development of digital infrastructures?”, we conducted a longitudinal case study at a Norwegian grid company and explored how a specific digital infrastructure evolved through continuous development. We identified generic interaction patterns with two cycles of sense-giving and sense-making between organizational actors, enabling the continuous development of the digital infrastructure. Our findings and model of interaction patterns offer a nuanced perspective on both digital infrastructure evolution and established views of sense-making and sense-giving mechanisms, as well as new ways to think about digitalization in incumbent firms.}

Likewise, exports and digital-related infrastructure are found to correlate positively with the expected digital technology adoption for customer relations business function. Similarly, study results from the transition probability matrix reveals that a significant persistency pattern is prevalent in all the three business functions of the firms, namely, supplier relations, customer relations and product development.

abstract = {Using artificial intelligence to improve patient care is a cutting-edge methodology, but its implementation in clinical routine has been limited due to significant concerns about understanding its behavior. One major barrier is the explainability dilemma and how much explanation is required to use artificial intelligence safely in healthcare. A key issue is the lack of consensus on the definition of explainability by experts, regulators, and healthcare professionals, resulting in a wide variety of terminology and expectations. This paper aims to fill the gap by defining minimal explainability standards to serve the views and needs of essential stakeholders in healthcare. In that sense, we propose to define minimal explainability criteria that can support doctors’ understanding, meet patients’ needs, and fulfill legal requirements. Therefore, explainability need not to be exhaustive but sufficient for doctors and patients to comprehend the artificial intelligence models’ clinical implications and be integrated safely into clinical practice. Thus, minimally acceptable standards for explainability are context-dependent and should respond to the specific need and potential risks of each clinical scenario for a responsible and ethical implementation of artificial intelligence.}

This is the first large cross-country study to undertake such an integrated analysis using the gravity framework. Results show that all types of RTAs have a positive and significant effect on bilateral tourism flows. The overall indicator of RTAs that captures the combined effect of all types of RTAs on bilateral tourism flows is also positive and significant, on average, as well as when different regions are separately evaluated. These findings underscore the importance of strong economic integration in fostering international tourism flows.

abstract = {How does the public perceive facial recognition technology and how much do they accept facial recognition technology in different political contexts? Based on online surveys resembling the Internet-connected population in China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, our study finds that facial recognition technology enjoys generally highest acceptance among respondents in China, while acceptance is lowest in Germany, and the United Kingdom and the United States are in between. A closer examination through the lens of an integrated technology acceptance model reveals interesting variations in the selected four countries based, among other factors, on socio-demographic factors as well as perceived consequences, usefulness, and reliability of facial recognition technology. While previous research has pointed out that facial recognition technology is an instrument for state surveillance and control, this study shows that surveillance and control are not foremost on the minds of citizens in China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but rather notions of convenience and improved security.}

Consequently, it has developed a generic digital curation lifecycle model, titled the d-KISTI model. This model was developed by applying content analysis and thematic coding to data collected through a two-year review of relevant literature, existing conceptual lifecycle models, and empirical investigations of KISTI’s digital curation practice. It was then refined further through consultations with many international digital curation experts. The d-KISTI model presents actions and their relationships with one another that have gone previously unacknowledged in the DCC curation lifecycle model and other existing curation models. These actions and relationships, which are articulated at length within the study, reflect the rapidly changing nature of the global digital curation landscape and offer more representative curation activities to information organizations. Moreover, through its investigation and analysis of KISTI’s digital curation practices, this study contributes to existing literature on digital curation in Korea. Ultimately, the d-KISTI model seeks to optimize digital curation strategies and practices, both within Korea and internationally, and, moreover, hopes to serve as a foundational touchstone for future studies on digital curation.}

abstract = {In the age of digitalization, big data analytics capabilities are considered one of the most critical organizational resources. Many organizations make considerable investments in these resources with an intention to improve their agility. However, the mechanism to reap agility from big data analytics still requires extensive empirical research and analysis. This study extends the big data analytics model by examining the mediating effects of entrepreneurial orientation between big data analytics capabilities and organizational agility. Partial least squares-structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the responses collected from 104 firms in Jordan. Results demonstrate that entrepreneurial orientation explains the relationship between big data analytics capabilities and agility. This finding contributes to the management literature by showing that big data analytics capabilities may enhance firm entrepreneurial orientation. While much of the prior research conceptualized the entrepreneurial orientation of the firm as a static characteristic, the current study argues that big data analytic capabilities play a key role in developing organizational agility through its role in improving entrepreneurial orientation, which subsequently creates value for firms, their customers, and the other stakeholders. Finally, challenges and future scope pertaining to this study are discussed. Recommendations for future studies on this promising topic include the use of longitudinal designs and mixed methods (quantitative with qualitative) approaches to provide researchers with new insights.}

But how does one strategize when the technologies core to organizational action is constantly changing? We suggest that for strategy scholars to answer this question, they will need to rethink the concept of technology. We begin by discussing the conceptual treatment of technology in studies of strategy and strategizing, and, in so doing, we highlight the ways in which current conceptualizations of technology are problematic for theorizing about the role of technology in the digital age. We then advance a relational perspective on technology that overcomes many of these problems. We illustrate the potential utility of this perspective for theories of strategic organization by using it to reconceptualize the boundaries of the firm, the process of innovation, and the process of organizational knowing.}

abstract = {Integrating signaling research with the institutional perspective on capital markets, we argue that, in conditions of radical technological change, investor perceptions about firm value are enhanced by the CEO’s orientation toward digital technologies that exceeds the firm’s industry peers. This base relationship is moderated by board characteristics so that the board members’ digital expertise and knowledge diversity enhance the effect of the CEO’s relative digital technology orientation on firm value. Furthermore, the monitoring power of independent board members who do not have digital expertise negatively moderates our baseline hypothesis, whereas board monitoring exerted by independent board members with digital expertise has a positive moderating effect. To test our theory, we use advanced natural language processing techniques to develop the CEO’s relative digital technology orientation construct combined with a unique, hand-collected set of measures associated with board members’ digital expertise and knowledge diversity in a sample of S&P 500 companies. Our article offers novel insights on how technology-related signals associated with the CEO’s communications to shareholders interact with board characteristics in determining investor perceptions of the firm’s value in conditions of high technological uncertainty.}

This analysis shifts the paradigm from looking at casual ambiguity as a given characteristic within organizations and examines the causal ambiguity paradox by looking at how organizations can strategically act on causal ambiguity as a mechanism for extending advantages. Specifically, we suggest actions that deliberately manage causal ambiguity can be a strategic capability and extend competitive advantages.}

Besides societal aspects, social media platforms, especially messenger services, have been identified as a positive driver for spreading conspiracy myths. Much research focused on whether right-wing populist attitudes correlate with belief in conspiracy myths resulting in inconsistent findings. We show that different anti-system attitudes and corresponding digital media usage can promote the affinity towards conspiracy myths apart from right-wing attitudes. With this paper, we first want to sharpen the terminology on “conspiracy myths” and develop a scale to measure affinity towards conspiracy myths in different dimensions. We second use this scale to investigate different mindsets of conspiracy in the Swiss population. Third, we want to find out how the dimensions correlate with messenger usage. Based on data from a representative population survey in Switzerland from November to December 2020, we investigated different affinities towards conspiracy myths, represented by far-left, far-right, populist, anti-elitism, general anti-system attitudes and science skepticism. We then used the six dimensions in a cluster analysis and identified five typological mindsets. About 30% of the population accordingly have higher affinities towards conspiracy myths than the rest. Our study also highlights the potential role of messenger services in spreading conspiracy myths. To a certain extent, Facebook Messenger and Telegram usage show a robust correlation with the different dimensions of the affinity towards conspiracy myths. In contrast, WhatsApp usage does not show a robust correlation.}

This study aimed to explore university students’ perspectives of entrepreneurship and to gain an understanding about the entrepreneurial experience in this period. Using reflexive photography as a visual method to extract qualitative data, this study presents a humanistic portrait of entrepreneurship as seen through the eyes of young people during COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal six emergent themes regarding entrepreneurship, which are agile adaptation to new conditions, the changes in consumer preferences, the psychological responses, the rising number of women entrepreneurs, the adverse effects on the hospitality industry and the adaptation problems of traditional business owners. The current research provides an understanding of being an entrepreneur in Turkey during a global pandemic. The findings would contribute to educational institutions, entrepreneurs, managers and policy makers in their future efforts on designing agile policies, systems and structures that would show resilience to similar crises and educating capable entrepreneurs.}

While most innovation projects in democratic regimes receive funding from media organizations, venture capital firms, and foundations, many of China’s digital journalism projects are funded and led by the state—a model we define as “state-preneurship.” In this study, we compare this model with other digital innovation models on three dimensions: the amount and sustainability of funding, the extent of newsroom restructuring, and the transformation of journalistic culture. We focus on the early national success case, Shanghai-based news outlet Pengpai, as well as on eight of its regional copycats. Based on interviews with forty-three executives, journalists, propaganda officials, media investors, and scholars, we argue that while in the short run, state-preneurship has produced fast and large-scale transformations in the digital journalism industry, these changes appear as largely unsustainable in the long run. This is due to (1) the political contingency of state investments and (2) the limited transformation in journalistic culture.}

abstract = {The current binary understanding of membership in international organizations (IOs), especially regional organizations (ROs), creates blind spots and biases in our understanding of who matters in IOs, as well as why and how they matter. Existing scholarship primarily looks at full member-states or non-state actors to capture who influences such organizations. Associated states are often portrayed as passive receivers of IO rules instead of active contributors. We address this blind spot and resulting analytical bias by exploring what types of association relationships exist and how they impact IOs. We propose a novel conceptualization of membership that we call memberness. On the level of IOs, memberness is based on the relative openness of organizational boundaries and stratified access via material and ideational contributions. On the level of states, memberness captures associated states’ individual choices to contribute materially and/or ideationally to an IO. Memberness moves away from a purely rights-based understanding of membership (or who you are in an IO) to include a capacity-based understanding (or what you do in an IO). This shift in focus uncovers new channels of influence on IOs. Associated states’ material and ideational contributions to IOs constitute three memberness types: payroller, sponsor, and advisor. We argue that these memberness types impact IOs’ vitality, design, and performance in previously unrecognized ways. We illustrate these types with empirical examples from ROs across the globe and discuss the implications of memberness for IO research programs.}

abstract = {This paper presents an exploratory case study of the Internet of things in telecommunications to analyze IoT technology in the telecom sector. It examines the IoT value in telecom and discusses the role of telecom operators across the value chain. It also presents a case analysis of IoT adoption in an emerging market of Pakistan to explore the IoT landscape in Pakistan and analyzes the IoT market positioning among telecom operators. It presents the business models and strategies which the telecom operators are following and analyzes the cost and benefits of IoT technology. It also discusses the IoT challenges faced by telecom operators during the adoption of IoT. In an emerging country like Pakistan, telecoms are adopting Internet of things technology, a novel, and real-time phenomenon. They are considering IoT technology as a new business opportunity in emerging markets, with the potential to be utilized as a new source of revenue. Telecoms are focusing on testing their roles in different areas of the IoT value chain. Their primary focus still remains basic connectivity which is evolved into smart connectivity. Telecoms are embracing their resources and capabilities across the IoT value chain, from connectivity to partnership, with innovative, value-added services. They are moving up to the IoT value chain by evolving further as an enabler for devices and enterprise-to-enterprise (E2E) solutions. They are developing partnerships with enterprises for providing various applications, service delivery, and system integration.}

While on a global scale a considerable share of the game industry’s revenue is captured by a few dozen firms, we are also witnessing the emergence of local and regional hotspots. In this context, legitimacy is of utmost importance if new competitive advantages are to become institutionalized as an industry. This paper extends studies which have offered temporal snapshots to the regional or local formation of game industry by focusing on the Finnish context. The concept of resilient values is introduced as legitimizing how the game industry is shaped and how the values are interpreted to develop the industry further. Our findings suggest legitimacy is intertwined with resilient values, thus resulting in the industry evolving over time through three different stages: (1) incubation period, (2) growth phase, and (3) institutionalized legitimacy.}

abstract = {3D virtual prototyping for garment development, although not much exploited and appreciated by the clothing industry in the early days of its appearance two decades ago, has now been explored (research-wise) extensively especially in the pandemic period and its impact on the whole supply chain of garments and fashion products. This virtual prototype which allows the company to visualize the status and condition of a clothing product that may be thousands of kilometers away, providing insights into how products can be better designed, manufactured, operated and serviced before companies invest in physical prototypes and assets, is often called digital twin. At the same time, laser-cut as a creative design technique on clothing materials have emerged in recent times, as fashion moguls are seeing the benefits that the technology presents. Laser cut technology with its benefits of accuracy, speed, precision, applicability in various materials, flexibility in geometry, interoperability with other systems like CAD/CAM and CIM, sustainability in resources and source of inspiration for several upcoming designers, provides an excellent approach for creating bridges between the past, the present and the future in history of fashion design. The aim of this paper was to provide a decision-making framework for the selection of an effective digital twinning process with the use of two different 3D virtual prototyping tools. For this purpose, a methodological framework is proposed which guides the creator according to the final use of the digital garment twin: evaluation of actual fit and actual representation of the produced physical, or as a shared digital asset for an exclusive digital environment.}

This article offers a unique empirical account of the inner workings of data-driven public administration, asking the overall question of how sociotechnical imaginaries of datafication are constrained in the context of public administration. Teams working on datafication in two Norwegian public sector entities have been followed and interviewed over the course of 2 years (2018–2020). While sociotechnical imaginaries thrive in organizational culture and policy discourse alike, the observed data teams struggle to realize data assemblages due to a variety of structural and institutional constraints.}

Conventionally, audiences were surveyed selectively, and the results were collated by professional agencies and often kept confidential. However, the conspicuous ratings given to media and cultural products outside their country of origin and their very public success and failure raises questions about the validity of such methods, particularly at a time when media and cultural products are used as proxies for cultural “soft power.” This term, first used by Joseph Nye in a political context, evokes reputational impact: a particular nation’s cultural and media products can “go global” if they prove sufficiently popular, reflecting positively on the originating nation. This article examines the various methods used to evaluate China’s “cultural power.” It notes the current weighting given to the humanities and social sciences. By applying some basic big data analysis and machine-learning techniques, the authors build on previous studies by offering new insights into the rise of “Digital China” and China’s digital and Internet trailblazers. The authors consider two major international metrics, as well as China’s early experimental attempts at devising its own standard, before introducing an alternative model, the cultural power metric.}

abstract = {eHealth is an opportunity cost, competing for limited available funds with other health priorities such as clinics, vaccinations, medicines and even salaries. As such, it should be appraised for probable impact prior to allocation of funds. This is especially pertinent as recognition grows for the role of eHealth in attaining Universal Health Coverage. Despite optimism about eHealth’s potential role, in Africa there remain insufficient data and skills for adequate economic appraisals to select optimal investments from numerous competing initiatives. The aim of this review is to identify eHealth investment appraisal approaches and tools that have been used in African countries, describe their characteristics and make recommendations regarding African eHealth investment appraisal in the face of limited data and expertise. Methods: Literature on eHealth investment appraisals conducted in African countries and published between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2020 was reviewed. Selected papers’ investment appraisal characteristics were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for economic evaluations and a newly developed Five-Case Model for Digital Health (FCM-DH) checklist for investment appraisal. 5 papers met inclusion criteria. Their assessments revealed important appraisal gaps. In particular, none of the papers addressed risk exposure, affordability, adjustment for optimism bias, clear delivery milestones, practical plans for implementation, change management or procurement, and only 1 paper described plans for building partnerships. Discussion: Using this insight, an extended 5-Case Model is proposed as the foundation of an African eHealth investment appraisal framework. This, combined with building local eHealth appraisal capabilities, may promote optimal eHealth investment decisions, strengthen implementations and improve the number and quality of related publications.}

The case is particularly useful for executive MBA courses on Strategy (the value of IT investments) or master’s-level courses on Business Process Management. This case has three main learning objectives. First, students will evaluate the capabilities of different (technological) approaches to reaching the airline’s business goals and will make a justified decision on the feasibility of implementing process mining. Second, students will analyze the airline’s approach to implementing process mining and the challenges along the way. They will derive lessons learned and discuss approaches to solving challenges. Third, students will evaluate the value potentials of process mining. This will enable the students to make well-informed decisions on technology investments and to discover how these decisions can contribute to business goals. The case is designed to be taught in two formats. In a 90-min lecture, students need to prepare short assignments for classroom discussions. In a 180-min lecture, the assignments are included as group work during the lecture, but they require the students to read the case before class. Teaching Notes, including videos and additional study material to support group work, are available to eligible lecturers upon request.}

We pay particular attention to the new council’s objectives to harness digital platform technologies to enhance participative democracy, and its agenda to secure technological sovereignty and digital rights for its citizens. While stressing the progressive intent of these aims, we also acknowledge the challenge of going beyond the repurposing of smart technologies so as to engender new and radical forms of subjectivity among citizens themselves; a necessary basis for any urban revolution.}

For example, legal and ethical accountabilities positively affect performance, but each type of accountability (formal and informal) influences the work performance of child-welfare caseworkers differently—directly or indirectly—through a compliance strategy. Hierarchical accountability and the adoption of a discretionary strategy do not affect performance, at least in this context. Accountability management appears to play a meaningful role as a mediator within the accountability-performance link.}

To understand what capabilities are crucial to establish platform ecosystems and how they contribute to value co-creation and value capture, we conducted a multi-year, in-depth case study of SAP’s cloud platform project. We identified (1) technology-related capabilities (cloud-based platformization, open IT landscape management) and (2) relationship-driven capabilities (ecosystem orchestration, platform evangelism, platform co-selling) and illustrate how these capabilities help the platform owner to enable and balance value co-creation and value capture in an emergent platform ecosystem. With our findings, we contribute to the discussion on how companies can overcome the challenging emergent phase of platform ecosystems. We thereby bridge literature on value creation in platform ecosystems and on organizational capabilities. Though we conducted our study in the context of the enterprise software industry, we discuss how our findings apply to prospective platform owners from different contexts.}

abstract = {Warehouse design is critical in the air cargo industry, where service standards are high and competition is fierce. The designers of air cargo warehouses consider various criteria like costs, system failure risks, customer perception, and marketing power to evaluate alternative designs. The issue of designing an air cargo warehouse is generally considered by design and consulting companies, which have broad experience in operational design are lacking in suggesting robust alternatives that build upon on a well-structured theoretical framework. The alternative warehouse designs are generated by considering different combinations of resource capacities such as the number of gates, workstations and storage areas. The evaluation of these alternative designs requires the use of analytical methodologies for multi-criteria decision-making. At this point, two methodologies from literature may be helpful: (i) simulation, which is a popular tool to evaluate operational performance and (ii) the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which provides the ability to evaluate qualitative as well as quantitative criteria. In this study, a flexible and user-friendly decision support system (DSS) is developed based on combining simulation and AHP. The DSS is used to generate design alternatives, evaluate their quantitative performance via simulation, and subsequently rank the best scoring ones via AHP according to a set of quantitative as well as qualitative decision criteria. The graphical interfaces are designed with a keen eye on man-machine interaction to increase their functionality. The environment is tested and validated with real-time data in one of Europe’s largest air cargo carriers.}

First, to present a comprehensive internal assessment of the hospital by different groups of stakeholders and, second, to determine whether there are common needs and wishes that, if incorporated in the hospital vision, will enable future development. Background: The Children’s Memorial Health Center is the largest children’s hospital in Poland. The hospital began operations in 1977 with a vision to be a modern healthcare facility that provides comprehensive care for children. That vision has not changed over time but everything else did. Methods: Six design thinking sessions were conducted with 83 employees and 40 respondents who used health services in the hospital in the past, along with in-depth interviews with 25 representatives of management to gather data for the hospital assessment. Results: Sixty-three features influencing future development were identified. Seven groups of features were classified to be either transformation drivers (four groups) or enablers (three groups). We focused on features that were indicated by all groups of respondents to define a common vision for future development. Conclusions: Depending on the respondent’s role in the healthcare ecosystem, the list of variables within each of seven groups defining the “hospital of the future” was different while evaluating the healthcare services. Therefore, all stakeholders must be engaged in the ideation process to create a strategy for a future care model driven by innovation.}

Through a systematic integration of political economic elements into an analysis of contemporary social transformations, this article joins this conversation by asking how Karl Polanyi’s double movement framework can clarify, and be extended by, the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. By embedding a nuanced account of neoliberalism in Egypt’s modern politics and by bringing those in dialogue with Polanyi’s theoretical apparatus, this article contends that there is a broad alignment between the first movement and the Egyptian neoliberal experience, a partial alignment between the second movement and the Egyptian Revolution, and a multilayered entanglement that implicates and encircles both movements. Not only does this research demonstrate that contemporary Egyptian history can find new currency in and be further illuminated by Polanyi’s political economy, it also critiques, complicates, reconceptualizes and extends Polanyi’s theoretical framework. In so doing, it redresses the underfocus of Polanyian political economy on the theory of revolution in general and the Egyptian Revolution in particular, problematizes extant accounts on neoliberalism and the double movement, and extends analyses between neoliberalism and revolution in political economy literatures. By clarifying our understanding of contemporary social change, this essay underscores how Polanyi’s work remains a pertinent, viable and valuable prism to examine momentous social transformations.}

This article uses the decision-makers, technological, organizational and environmental (DTOE) framework to examine the key e-commerce barriers and determinants in e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs based on a survey of retail and food and beverage (F&B) service establishments in metropolitan Bangkok. This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the types of barriers that hinder e-commerce utilization by Thai SMEs in the F&B and retail services, as well as their key determinants. Unlike e-commerce adoption, e-commerce utilization can capture the full range of e-commerce engagement. The survey’s findings indicate that organizational barriers significantly inhibit e-commerce utilization. Estimations from the structural equation modelling (SEM) show that exports, e-commerce tools, government support, and internal and external e-commerce platforms can enhance e-commerce utilization. In addition, business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce can increase the exports of Thai SMEs, while older entrepreneurs and SMEs tend to neglect e-commerce. Evidence-based policy implications and suggestions are also discussed in this study to enhance e-commerce utilization for Thai SMEs.}

While many critical scholars as well as most public and private organisations understand this concept as a computational procedure instantiated by a programming code in a software stack, I argue that the algorithm is better understood as a “figure”; a discursive short-hand pointing to diverse modes of procedural governance and not always digital ones. Since algorithmic figures are generated by a bundle of heterogeneous contexts, their emergence leads to conflicting visions about the reality, materiality and effects of algorithmisation. This article provides four ethnographic strategies to describe the contexts of production and circulation of algorithmic figures: observing the observers of algorithms; mapping and creating algorithmic figures; drawing relations across contexts of figuring; and analysing the transformative effects of algorithmic figures on the attempts to govern them.}

abstract = {Removing backward production capacity and clearing out zombie enterprises is crucial to realize the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. However, as a command-control environmental regulation policy, whether the New Environmental Protection Law (NEPL) can guide heavy-polluting enterprises to achieve green transformation and get rid of the zombified risk remains unknown. Our article applies the difference-in-difference (DID) method to explore the impact of the stricter environmental regulation policies on the de-zombification of heavily polluting enterprises in the context of the implementation of NEPL in China. The results show that the implementation of NEPL significantly reduces the zombified risk of heavy-polluting enterprises. The results were valid by a series of robustness tests of propensity score matching, common trends test, placebos test, conducting double clustered standard errors to industry and province level, eliminating other policy interference, ruling out reverse causation, easing the potential endogeneity problems, and controlling enterprise’s internal management level. Furthermore, there is a time lag in NEPL policy, which requires a long-term mechanism. Moreover, the NEPL can promote enterprise de-zombie governance through the mechanism of market competition and market allocation. The effects of the NEPL are heterogeneous due to the nature of enterprise property rights, enterprise scale, industry radiation capacity, regional development level, and internal management capacity. This article provides policy implications for developing countries to promote de-zombified governance of their economic systems and defuse risks of green transition.}

A sustained effort has been dedicated to encouraging industrial organizations to embrace the Industry 4.0 paradigm and technologies. Despite these continued efforts, engaging with Industry 4.0 is still difficult in countries like Tunisia and Morocco, particularly because industrial organizations struggle to find fresh graduates on the job market who are both skilled and qualified in Industry 4.0 operations. The contribution of this article is to initiate a process to better understand and assess the gap between industrial needs and academic offer with respect to Industry 4.0 skills and qualifications, considering the specificities of Tunisia and Morocco. We particularly focus on analyzing to what extent existing curricula in engineering education institutions satisfy or miss industrial needs and requirements in three core industrial business processes: maintenance, production, and quality (MPQ4.0). Therefore, a survey was conducted, from which a set of MPQ4.0 targeted skills and competencies were extracted and synthesized. Based on these skills and competencies, sample engineering education curricula are analyzed, gaps are identified, and recommendations for improvement are offered.}

We suggest that organizational theorists have been reluctant to address the constitutive relation between technology and organizing. By emphasizing co-constitution, we argue against viewing technology as an entity that is separate, exogenous, or causal. Instead, we offer that technology can be fruitfully viewed as endogenous to and constitutively entwined with organizational actions and structures. To illustrate this co-constitution, we present a brief analysis of Uberization from a regime of organizing perspective that emphasizes how organizing practices, valuation schemes, authority arrangements and technological arrangements are entwined with each other. We conclude with an invitation to organizational theorists to more specifically engage with technology as they theorize new forms of organizing.}

The influence of process parameters such as layer thickness, infill density, and infill pattern on the interlaminar bonding performance of three-dimensional printed composites was examined in this study. Due to the existence of high porosity and inadequate layer to layer bond, interlaminar shear strength values increase as layer height increases from 0.15 mm to 0.2 mm and decrease by 0.3 mm. The specimens were also subjected to a wettability test to determine the printed material’s adhesive behavior. Scanning electron microscope was used to perform fractography analysis, and fractured specimens were seen. The test findings revealed that carbon fiber reinforced ABS specimens have good interlaminar shear strength and layer adhesive. When comparing carbon fiber reinforced ABS specimens to ABS specimens, the test results demonstrated that interlaminar shear strength and good adhesion between the layers are attained in carbon fiber reinforced ABS specimens.}

The study made it possible to determine the key success factors for the development and consolidation of modern media competencies in the context of online learning. The involvement of each student in the generation of educational content has formed the teaching tactics for the stable development of target media competencies and skills. Group interactions of students associated with the course met student demand for socialisation and contributed to educational progress. It was concluded that media literacy is the result of well-planned and well-organised practical activities of students in the digital media space.}

abstract = {Crowdwork conducted via digital platforms is a young form of work, but a growing part of the gig economy. Typical for crowdwork is low pay, volatile income streams and no social security benefits. Also, crowdworkers have few possibilities for social comparison or negotiation because they work outside of company organisations. This article examines the question of whether these conditions mean that crowdworkers’ expectations about justice in crowdwork arrangements differ in comparison to their expectations regarding justice in conventional employment relationships. This question is addressed empirically on the basis of 36 qualitative interviews and a survey of 230 crowdworkers. The justice expectations of crowdworkers involved in different types of crowdworking platforms in German-speaking countries were examined. In our sample, crowd work typically serves to supplement – not replace – conventional employment. This explorative research shows that crowdworkers use similar standards of justice regarding work performance in their evaluations of work mediated via crowdwork platforms and conventional employment. It shows that crowdworkers perceive injustices in four specific areas: planning insecurity, lack of transparency in performance evaluation, lack of clarity in task briefings and low remuneration. These areas correspond to the theoretical dimensions of distributive and procedural justice on Colquitt’s (2001) organisational justice scale. These findings have implications for future efforts to regulate crowdwork. JEL codes: J88; J3}

We proposed an extended theory of planned behavior by incorporating protection motivation theory. The results showed that consumer assessments of perceived severity and altruistic fear of COVID-19 and response efficacy and self-efficacy of channel switching increased their beliefs (i.e., attitude, perceived behavior control, subjective norm) and intentions to switch shopping channels to online. We also found that the age (young vs. old) moderated the effects of response efficacy and self-efficacy on perceived behavior control, perceived severity on subjective norm, perceived behavior control on channel switching intentions, and channel switching intention on actual switching behavior. The findings provide fashion retailers and the society with a better understanding about fashion consumers’ shopping channel switching under the pandemic.}

abstract = {Technology is often used by senior management as an instrument to deliver strategy by influencing day-to-day activities within organisations. We study how local teams appropriate strategy through the use of technology, specifically in instances where it is rigid and single purposed. We show that technology has the potential to act as a carrier of strategic intent. We theorise local practices of appropriation of strategic intent by conceptualising the role of technology in “instantiation”, a notion adopted within the strategy-as-practice literature to explain how localised micro events directly constitute higher-level business outcomes such as those that arise from strategy. Through an in-depth case study following the use of passenger self-service kiosks in a UK airport over a period of 20 months, we review the strategic drivers at the top of the organisation and the central role of technology as the delivery mechanism of strategy. We focus on emergent strategising activity by local teams on the ground. Our main theoretical contributions are thus to extend the concept of instantiation to Information Systems studies and to conceptualise technology as a carrier of strategy, particularly in explaining how technology can embed strategic intent (structural strategising) and then influence the emergence of local practices consistent with these objectives (emergent strategising). We find and conceptualise how local practices instantiate strategic intent by decoupling, reframing and then recoupling new logics of work to achieve the aims set out in the organisation’s strategy.}

The case allows students to explore the role of ethics when developing an AI-based tool in an area that they all know very well: Most students will have had to sit high-stakes assessments in the past and are still likely to be assessed on an ongoing basis as a current student. Students will thus be able to relate to the case and have their own stake(s) and opinion(s) about whether they would want to be assessed by AI. The case is also more broadly applicable in raising general awareness of the challenges and potential risks involved when using AI for decision making and it encourages students to consider the wider consequences for all stakeholders that are triggered by the use of digital technology.}

The proposed model combines recent research from organizational psychology and agile information systems development to provide a better understanding of the team-level effects. Our findings from three case studies conducted in two large insurance companies and one software development company suggest that social agile practices positively influence psychological safety, transparency, communication, and ultimately productivity.}

Drawing on institutional ethnographic approaches, this paper describes the misalignments between how technology is described in government documentation, and how it is deployed in social service delivery. We argue that the propagation of ethical principles legitimates established new public management strategies, and pre-empts questions regarding the efficacy of AI development; instead positioning implementation as inevitable and, provided an ethical framework is adopted, laudable. The ethical AI discourse acknowledges, and ostensibly seeks to move past, widely reported administrative failures involving new technologies. In actuality, this discourse works to make AI implementation a reality, ethical or not.}

The study intends to explore the relationship between Transformational Leadership (TFL) and Work Engagement (WE) with the mediating role of Structural Empowerment (SE) and Process Innovation (PI) during COVID-19. The quantitative research methodology was utilized and a simple random sampling technique was used for collection of data from 360 supervisors of banks in Pakistan using questionnaires. Hypotheses are tested with the help of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) by using AMOS. By using SEM, confirmatory factor analysis revealed a statistically significant model. Outcomes showed a significant connection among TFL, WE, and PI. However, SE only significantly relates to TFL. Partial mediation through PI was discovered with the presence of a significant indirect path between TFL and WE. In contrast, the mediation of SE is not ascertained due to insignificant indirect effects. The digitally evolving banking industry in Pakistan requires engagement at workplace. The organization must be very much aware of the crucial job of leaders for WE as well as for PI just as the SE of employees. The findings of the study also highlight the importance of best HR practices that should work for creating intangible motivators for boosting WE level.}

The embedding of digital technologies within urban infrastructures has been well documented, and the efficiencies of smart models of urban governance and management have been lauded. More recently, however, the discourse has been labelled “hegemonic”, and accused of developing a view of smart technology that is blinkered by its failure to critique its socio-political effects. By focusing on the case of Singapore’s “Smart Nation” initiative, this paper embraces the paradoxes at the heart of smart urbanism and, in doing so, interrogates the tension between ideology and praxis, efficiency and control, access and choice, and smart governance and smart citizenship. It also demonstrates how such tensions are (re)produced through “fourthspace” – the digitally enabled spaces of urbanism that are co-created, and that contribute to an expansion and diffusion of social and political responsibility. It ends by suggesting how such spaces have the potential to radically transform not just the urban environment, but also the role of government and citizens in designing urban futures.}

The results show that increased migration rates lead to higher international tourism flows in destination countries. This effect becomes even stronger when the destination country has a larger linguistic network. Migration matters less, however, when a country-pair shares closer linguistic ties. The findings of this study will help to inform public, and tourism industry policies aimed at boosting sustainable tourism flows, especially post COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted immigration policies, such as those that seek to attract foreign workers with specific skill sets, tend to enlarge linguistic networks and contribute to multilingualism, which in turn can boost international tourism flows.}

Nineteen young adults between 20 and 25 years of age with different educational levels participated in our study in May 2020. Our results show that even though the participants only occasionally use traditional news media channels, they still consider journalistic news relevant and appreciate quality standards of professional journalism such as actuality and veracity (Swart 2021b). Among the functions of news, the participants highlighted sociability and identification. Exchange and discussion of news are, thus, of high relevance online but also offline. Also, the participants show a high affinity toward news on mobilizing topics, which are of interest to themselves and their peers, and motivate them to engage with news more intensely. According to the participants, news should be attractively prepared, such as with audiovisual formats and easy to understand and integrate into everyday life. The participants also expressed a preference to consume news articles from different media brands within a single platform.

Automation at work, combined with the global economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic situation has lead the workforce to lose their jobs at an accelerated pace, and the trend is expected to continue. The ongoing shift in the division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms might displace almost 85 million jobs worldwide in the next 5 years, as per the World Economic Forum (WEF). The world of work is changing with a multi-generational workforce and changing employment models with more flexibility. The location is no more a constraint to acquire capable talent. The gig economy is booming, and today’s workers prefer to adopt the gig model, and employers are increasingly preferring gig workers to the permanent workforce and preferring skills and competencies over formal qualifications. A location-independent global workforce is also emerging, and the talent becomes more fungible across all the domains. As the labour market will be highly competitive in a few years, there is a need for employers to prepare their existing workforce for future-readiness. They need to upskill them with a new set of competencies. This study describes the initiative of a larger organisation that has identified a new set of competencies and set up an Academy of Future Skills to make their workforce future ready.}

We conduct a theoretical synthesis of the literature on industrial organization, technology management, network economics, operations management, and strategic management—with the implications of each theory related to the dominant-design battle in AI. The findings indicate a dominant design for AI will be based on innovation concerning business models as much as on technology, and that the dominant business model will include AI as a service.}

abstract = {In recent years, governments have increased their efforts to strengthen the citizen-orientation in policy design. They have established temporary arenas as well as permanent units inside the machinery of government to integrate citizens into policy formulation, leading to a “laboratorization” of central government organizations. We argue that the evolution and role of these units herald new dynamics in the importance of organizational reputation for executive politics. These actors deviate from the classic palette of organizational units inside the machinery of government and thus require their own reputation vis-à-vis various audiences within and outside their parent organization. Based on a comparative case study of two of these units inside the German federal bureaucracy, we show how ambiguous expectations of their audiences challenge their organizational reputation. Both units resolve these tensions by balancing their weaker professional and procedural reputation with a stronger performative and moral reputation. We conclude that government units aiming to improve citizen orientation in policy design may benefit from engaging with citizens as their external audience to compensate for a weaker reputation in the eyes of their audiences inside the government organization. Points for practitioners Many governments have introduced novel means to strengthen citizen-centered policy design, which has led to an emergence of novel units inside central government that differ from traditional bureaucratic structures and procedures. This study analyzes how these new units may build their organizational reputation vis-à-vis internal and external actors in government policymaking. We show that such units assert themselves primarily based on their performative and moral reputation.}

abstract = {Although it is part of core government business to collect information about its citizens, “big data” has increased the scale, speed and complexity of data collection and use to such an extent that it is arguably qualitatively different from the record-keeping that has gone before it. Big data represents a radical shift in the balance of power between State and citizen. This article argues that embedding big data in government operations masks its deployment as enhancing government power, rather than simply facilitating execution of government activities. In other words, big data is “disruptive” technology that calls for the examination of the limits of government power. To illustrate this argument, this article examines a selection of recent case studies of attempts by the Australian government to deploy big data as a tool of governance. It identifies the risk to the citizen inherent in the use of big data, to justify review of the bounds of government power in the face of rapid technological change.}

In our attempts at sense-making of togetherness in a COVID-19/post-COVID-19 world, we believe it may be an oversimplification to conceptualise our daily data trails as “digital footprints”. The nature of our interaction with these technologies as well as their interaction with us have changed deeply ever since the rapid growth of digital connectivity. The character of these symbiotic relationships has been accentuated even more by our global experience of “connected disconnection” during the pandemic’s lockdowns. Against this background, we expand the concept of “geno-digital spores” as a more appropriate metaphor for the manner within which data and technology combine in new ways to create (or fracture) lines of togetherness.}

Digital media technologies exert significant influence on the enactment of controversy in online settings, and this risks undermining the substantive focus of controversy analysis conducted by digital means. To address this problem, I propose a shift in thematic focus from controversy analysis to issue mapping. The article begins by distinguishing between three broad frameworks that currently guide the development of controversy analysis as a digital method, namely, demarcationist, discursive, and empiricist. Each has been adopted in STS, but only the last one offers a digital “move beyond impartiality.” I demonstrate this approach by analyzing issues of Internet governance with the aid of the social media platform Twitter.}

The data was analysed by using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. The findings reveal that the universities, academic libraries and lecturers had prepared the necessary conditions to support digital reading (i.e. regulations, processes, programmes, digital resources). Another highlighted result indicates that factors concerning students and lecturers had the most important influence on digital reading based on the responses of the library staff and students. The findings of this study will be useful for administrators, faculty members and library staff in designing appropriate solutions and programmes to support digital reading for undergraduate students.}

A subset of the literature on digital platforms scrutinized the political economy of platform companies, their data-driven business models along with the economic, social, and political consequences of platformization. Yet, this strand has been overwhelmingly interested in Big Tech companies in the United States and China. In this article, I aim to expand the geographical span of this emerging literature by scrutinizing platformization dynamics in Turkey, a middle-income country that has not been systematically examined so far along these lines. To this end, I present an assessment on the overall platform landscape in Turkey by focusing on three highlight digital platforms (Trendyol, Hepsiburada, and Getir). My analysis on the trajectory of these three platforms indicates the following. First, these platforms have exhibited meteoric growth rates and have risen among the most valuable companies in Turkey in a tremendously short period of time. Second, their aggressive growth strategies based on data extraction and network externalities have led to a strong monopolization drive. Third, they have rapidly expanded into adjacent business areas, transforming themselves into infrastructural components of the domestic economy, with profound impacts on production, trade, and labor relations. Fourth, they remain dependent on the infrastructure laid by Big Techs. These findings suggest that platformization is rapidly transforming economic landscapes other than the United States and China as well, yet in an uneven and dependent form, underlining the need to broaden the geographical focus of the concerned literature.}

abstract = {Vendor capabilities are an important research stream in the IT outsourcing literature. The extant studies have generated rich findings on how vendors develop capabilities, but these findings have mainly been based on the condition of vendors improving their existing business. How vendors develop capabilities to move up the value chain has received little prior research attention. A key challenge for vendors in moving up the value chain is the development of new capabilities while maintaining the existing ones. This challenge is consistent with achieving exploration and exploitation in organizational ambidexterity. Hence, we adopt organizational ambidexterity as our theoretical lens. By conducting a case study on four IT outsourcing vendors in China, we identify four classifications for achieving ambidexterity in capability development and the context for each classification. These classifications are based on combinations of different structural arrangements and processes for achieving ambidexterity. Our study contributes to the research on IT outsourcing vendor capabilities by improving our understanding of capability development in vendors moving up the value chain. It also contributes to the organizational ambidexterity literature by identifying the factors that influence the choices of different structural arrangements and processes.}

It aims to expand on existing understandings of postfeminism and popular feminism by exploring how these sensibilities have been taken up and expressed within arts and cultural policy discourse. How has the problem of the cultural gender gap previously been understood? And how has that changed in light of increased public attention to feminist concerns? While there are important differences across the decades there are also recurring notions of pragmatism, self-empowerment, resilience, vigilance and trickle-down logics – which cultivate a sense of movement without progress. By looking at policy discourses and gender equality talk through a longer lens, considering situations of feminist visibility and invisibility, acceptance and repudiation, and inequalities that are speakable and unspeakable, we see how inequalities in the creative and cultural industries come to be both enduring and endurable.}

Findings revealed that internal factors are perceived to have a higher impact than external factors. However, external factors are perceived to have a stronger negative impact than positive ones. Findings also raise several issues regarding scientific considerations, institutional requirements, and socio-political conditions that lead researchers to either avoid certain topics or change the angle of their view for their research. The study proposed a theoretical framework regarding the process of selecting research problems in the media field of Arab countries.}

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. A data-based convergent synthesis design is adopted. Pedagogies and technologies commonly used are examined. Studies using a blended approach to teaching and learning provide more detail about the pedagogies and technologies used than those studies using a fully online model. There is scant information regarding the principles underpinning the development and delivery of online PETE courses. We provide extensive insights into the key learning from the experiences of faculty and pre-service teachers who engage with online teaching and learning in PETE. Our findings suggest online instruction may suit particular students and facilitate a shift to independent learning. Teaching and learning in the online space can impact the development of relationships, both positively and negatively. Furthermore, constructivist pedagogies should be prioritised, alongside support for students and teacher educators to develop online learning competence. Our review highlights considerations for teacher educators engaging in online teaching and learning in PETE and implications for future research.}

We seek to open up the alluring yet troubling figure of patient participation, by inquiring into how patients enact participation in different ways. Based on close ethnographic engagement in a user test of the e-health system P-Record, we show how a group of heart patients shaped their participation along three lines of tactics of material participation: “activism”, “partnership” and “compliance”. Our argument is twofold. First, we suggest that any invitation to participate carries the inherent paradox that, although certain ideas of participation may be materially embedded, e.g. in e-health or other “participatory technologies”, the enactment of participation cannot be foreseen. To participate is to creatively make do with the situation and technologies at hand, making participation normatively variable in practice. Second, we suggest seeing these normative variations as distinct, though interwoven, lines of tactics that bring about different expectations and, to different degrees, allow patients to handle ambiguous invitations to participate.}

The exponentially growing amount of data has made it essential for firms to transform them into digital format for ensuring better flow and sharing of information across the organisation. Digitisation has been referred to as the process of converting various diverse forms of information, such as text, images, sound or voice, into an electronic format that leads to improved operations and reduced costs for firms. The research paper has discussed this digitisation process of a firm and analysed its consequent impact on the corporate governance. In this regard, various articles have been explored for the purposes of understanding how digitisation can improve or threaten corporate governance of firms. Digitisation has created some big disruptive storms some of which have resulted in a reimagined manner of doing business, affecting demand and supply principles in any company. As a result, in order to gain market confidence, businesses must establish credibility and integrity.}

As the International Public Sector Accounting Standards have insufficiently moved Europe towards accounting harmonization in recent years, the European Commission currently aims to suggest the adoption of European Public Sector Accounting Standards. Based on a multinational survey among budget experts, the current article investigates budget experts’ perceptions towards adopting the European Public Sector Accounting Standards. The findings compare attitudes towards new accounting practices and European Public Sector Accounting Standards reform expectations on a comparative basis, and relate them to the current national accounting system and contextual factors. Empirical results indicate great variation in terms of European Public Sector Accounting Standards reform expectations across countries. The study concludes with discussing the implications of the findings for international accounting research, accounting harmonization and the development of a European accounting system. Points for practitioners In this early stage of European Public Sector Accounting Standards development, understanding the factors associated with a country’s decision to adopt them could be helpful for practitioners and professionals. The current study identifies information technology costs as a potential barrier to implementing the European Public Sector Accounting Standards. Politicians and standard setters might take this into account while developing the European Public Sector Accounting Standards. Furthermore, this article reveals that encouraging the voluntary introduction of accrual accounting in the first stage of European Public Sector Accounting Standards development might be the appropriate approach of the European Commission.}

Synthesizing 27 samples (N = 3563 coaching processes), this meta-analysis sheds light on the relationship between working alliance and a broad range of coaching outcomes for clients. The meta-analytic results indicate a moderate and consistent overall relationship between a high-quality working alliance and coaching outcomes for clients (r = .41, 95% CI [.34, .48], p < .001). Working alliance was positively related to all desirable coaching outcomes (range: r = .32 to .64), with the strongest relationship to affective and cognitive coaching outcomes. Moreover, working alliance was negatively related to unintended negative effects of coaching (r = –.29). Results revealed no differences regarding the type of clients, coaches’ expertise, number of coaching sessions, and clients’ or coaches’ perspectives. Similar to other helping relationships like psychotherapy or mentoring, the results support the importance of a high-quality working alliance in coaching.}

In this article we investigate the motivation of young project professionals in the context of four case studies. Based on self-determination theory, we outline the Conceptual Model of Young Project Professional Motivation, which is comprised of autonomy, competence, relatedness, and purpose. The study offers several contributions to theory and practice. First, the article extends the understanding to self-determination theory by operationalizing the different needs of young project professionals in projects. Second, it explicitly adds the need for purpose as a central motivator to our theoretical understanding. Third, it puts the motivators in contexts and shows that these motivators have varying levels of importance in different project and organizational contexts. From a practice perspective, the study contributes to a better understanding of how to attract and retain young project professionals in organizations, for example, by fostering work environments and career opportunities that are aligned with their needs.

Digital finance could be the antidote. To promote equity in healthcare delivery, this study explores the mitigating effect of digital finance by elucidating the relationship between relative deprivation of income and chronically ill patients’ trust. Methods Using data from the China Family Panel Study, a Poisson regression model was applied to assess the effect of relative deprivation of income on chronically ill patients’ trust. A marginal effect analysis was used to verify the effect and a two-stage least squares method was used to test robustness. Results Chronically ill patients’ trust was at a medium level (5.98 ± 2.05). Relative deprivation of income significantly reduced patients’ trust (β=−0.056, p < 0.1). The digital finance had a positive effect on patients’ trust (β=0.035, p < 0.01) and alleviated the negative effect of relative deprivation of income on patients’ trust (β=0.105, p < 0.01). The instrumental variable estimation results confirmed the robustness of the benchmark regression results. Conclusions The inequity resulting from relative deprivation of income undermines patients’ trust. Digital finance has a long-term effect on alleviating perception of inequity among chronically ill patients. The government should promote the integration of digital finance and smart healthcare to enhance patients’ trust and contribute to equality in healthcare delivery. Limitations include self-reported data and an insufficient correlation between selected indicators and healthcare services.}

It pointed out that judgments of transparency differ according to the relationship that consumers have personally developed with their digital environment (literacy, consumer acumen, and concern for privacy). Based on an empirical study conducted in e-commerce (N = 445), the results show that perceived clarity – unlike perceived objectivity – is accompanied by a decline in trust and has a direct impact on engagement. On the contrary, perceived openness encourages engagement but not trust. This research highlights how consumer literacy and consumer acumen promote the perception of transparency, while concern for privacy degrades it. Theoretical and practical implications are then drawn from this research.}

A structured questionnaire was used to collect responses from faculty of education institutes in India. Two hundred forty responses from 24 institutions are utilized for further analysis using PLS-SEM. Our findings show that the mediators, confidence in the vaccine and problematic social media use, mediate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and future career anxiety. Future career anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered turnover intention mainly due to the drastic change in the work culture it has brought in its wake. Fear of COVID-19 has a significant relationship with future career anxiety, leading to turnover intention among the faculty. Problematic social media use impacts future career anxiety. This study provides a model to explore the relationship between fear of COVID-19, and future career anxiety with confidence in vaccine and problematic social media use as the mediating variables. Our findings extend the conservation of resources theory.}

abstract = {In the context of carbon emission reduction, both servitization and digitalization of manufacturing enterprises are important ways to promote the high-quality development of manufacturing enterprises. The coordinated development of digitalization and servitization may provide a feasible path for enterprises to realize energy conservation and emission reduction across the value chain. Based on the 393 valid questionnaires issued by the Association of Manufacturing Enterprises and government agencies, this paper uses the methods of Grey Relational Analysis and Topsis to construct three major indicator systems of manufacturing enterprise service, digitalization and high-quality economic development. Based on the Cobb–Douglas production function regression analysis, the relevant assumptions involved in the model of promoting the service of manufacturing enterprises and the model of promoting the digitalization of manufacturing enterprises are verified. The empirical results show that, firstly, the digitalization capability of manufacturing enterprises can positively affect the servitization performance of manufacturing enterprises. Secondly, the digital capability of manufacturing enterprises has a significant positive impact on both breakthrough service innovation and incremental innovation of manufacturing enterprises. Thirdly, breakthrough service innovation and incremental service innovation play a partial mediating role. Fourthly, the degree of servitization of manufacturing enterprises has a significant positive impact on the digital demand of supporting customer behavior service business and supporting customer product service. There are three possible contributions of this paper. Firstly, it has further enriched and deepened the research on the interactive mechanism of digitalization and service of manufacturing enterprises. The second is to design a scientific and systematic evaluation system for the digitalization and service level of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, and measure and evaluate the coupling and coordination level of digitalization and service level of Chinese manufacturing enterprises based on this. Thirdly, it reveals the promotion of the coordinated development of digitalization and service in manufacturing enterprises to the high-quality development of manufacturing enterprises in China and puts forward that the coordinated development of digitalization and service in manufacturing enterprises is a way to promote the high-quality development of manufacturing enterprises.}

However, a broad range of challenges has been identified, and one of these relates to the power asymmetries in developing countries. These power asymmetries are often deeply entrenched. We conducted an in-depth critical case study of an information and communication technology for development project in India. We looked at the historical and cultural context, the roles of the actors, and the use of symbolic practices. Using Bourdieu’s theory of practice and, in particular, his concept of habitus, our findings reveal how symbolic practices can work against ICT projects in developing countries. These symbolic practices, rooted in a particular culture, are tied to and constitutive of power asymmetries. We offer a framework for studying habitus in information systems research on information and communication technology for development that may be useful for others who wish to explore similar questions in their case study research.}

In addition, we attempted to provide key cases in which LA has been effectively deployed for various purposes during the pandemic in the higher education context. We found out several prominent challenges for stakeholders. Accordingly, learners needed of timely support and interaction, and experienced difficulty of time management. Instructors lacked pedagogical knowledge for online teaching. In particular, individual and collaborative assessment have been a challenge for them. Institutions have not been ready for a digital transformation and online teaching. In response to these challenges, LA tools have been deployed for the following opportunities: monitoring, planning online learning process, fostering learners’ engagement and motivation, facilitating assessment process; increasing interaction, improving retention, being easy to use. Understanding these promises can also give insight into future higher education policies.}

Using datasets of young people from all three countries, our results indicate a stronger mediation of school subjects for Scotland than in Germany and Ireland and a remarkable gender gap in STEM enrollment in all three countries. We conclude that females studying science subjects within upper secondary education appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition to ensure gender equality in progression to STEM fields.}

abstract = {During the pandemic, the attention and demand for cold chain increased owing to considerable use of low-temperature logistics in transporting perishable goods and vaccines. To ensure the shipping performance for reduced damage, logistics companies are required to track continually and repetitively the status of shipments daily. However, typing various air waybills for searching the shipping status is a cause of frequent errors. Also, tracking the shipping status is labor-intensive, resource intensive, inefficient and repetitive. Moreover, repetitive tasks result in low employee satisfaction. Therefore, robotic process automation (RPA) applications have gained the attention of practitioners in the cold chain logistics industry. This study contributes to (i) determining possible areas requiring automation through the workflow study on cold chain logistics and (ii) streamlining the operation by the develop a robotic process automation bots. A case study tested and evaluated the performance of two unattended RPA bots applied in a freight forwarder company to check shipment status and temperature conditions. The results determined that implementing RPA in the workflow reduces significant data processing time. With the implementation of proposed RPA bots, the company can better comprehend its shipping performance of logistics and can get an immediate notification from RPA bots when an abnormal situation occurs with regard to a shipment.}

The sports organisations are no strangers to this digitisation and must carry out their own digital transformation. However, investment in digital technology must be preceded by a diagnosis of the technological needs of each sports entity. Said mapping will help organisations know the most appropriate technological tools for their core businesses so they can properly design their digital transformation strategies. The objectives of this study were to design and create a tool to understand the digital structure of Spanish sports. The result has been the configuration of an instrument that includes the description of different technologies and different digital competencies specific to the sports industry, and which allows individuals to know the use, importance, perceived difficulty of use and economic accessibility of available technologies, as well as the degree of developed competency in the different sports organisations. It is concluded that the creation and application of a consultation instrument on digitalisation is the first and necessary step to carry out relevant, in-depth, valid and replicable research, which allows information to be gathered on the digitalisation needs of sports organisations to design their digital transformation roadmap and that the aids for digital transformation is distributed efficiently.}

To gain insights into how employees manage the uncertainty driven by digital transformation and also how leaders can support them, this study has drawn on the theory of communication and uncertainty management (TCUM), which posits that the impact of uncertainty varies by how individuals appraise it and social support enhances positive appraisal. Based on those tenets, the current study advanced the following hypotheses: (a) uncertainty has direct and indirect negative effects on employees’ appraisal of digital transformation, self-efficacy, and job performance; (b) in contrast, direct supervisors’ transformational leadership has direct and indirect positive effects on appraisal, self-efficacy, and job performance; and also (c) transformational leadership moderates the impact of uncertainty. SEM with 4-wave time-separated data (N = 873 employee-supervisor dyads in Japan) found support for these hypotheses. The obtained findings are discussed with reference to TCUM, transformational leadership, and other relevant literature.}

However, requiring students to explicitly reflect on peer reviewing is an understudied learning activity in higher education that may contribute to the utilization of peer-feedback and promote further learning. In this study, we suggest reflection on peer reviewing as one approach to providing a platform for students to engage in reflective practices and for stimulating active learning in higher education, and to make that learning visible to the educator. We examine 26 undergraduate students’ reflections on peer-review to identify categories of reflection and what students have learnt from the peer reviewing process. Our findings reveal six different categories of reflection suggesting students’ active engagement in learning and pointing to the ways educators can direct and instruct students how to reflect. We discuss how these findings can inform university lecturers in the use of reflection upon peer reviewing as a pedagogical tool in higher education.}

Most of these studies are related to the disciplines of pedagogy and informatics. The rest of the relevant literature cannot be definitively assigned to one discipline, but is often located at the intersection with the field of management. Taking a creative inquiry approach to analyzing this body of literature, the following key issues have been identified as of major relevance for future research. First, we must further explore what kind of influence the organizational culture of higher education institutions (HEIs) has on the strategy and implementation of integrating technology into the learning process. Second, we need to determine whether the integration of technology into the learning process at HEIs has the potential to support organizational development (mission, etc.) and/or adaptation, and whether an entrepreneurial culture could foster this potential.}

abstract = {The topic of predatory publishing and ways to combat it is garnering considerable attention in many parts of the developed world, where academic librarians are emerging as leaders in this regard. However, less is known about how this phenomenon is playing out in developing regions, including Spanish-speaking Latin America. This study presents the results of a survey of 104 academic librarians in this region, along with follow-up interviews with seven respondents. The findings reveal that scholarly publishing literacy in general, and predatory publishing in particular, currently has low visibility in this part of the world, although there is growing recognition of and increasing concern about the issue. Although there is some debate about whether scholarly publishing literacy should be the sole responsibility of the library, many participants agree that the library has a role to play. Moreover, while most of the librarians who participated perceive that they have a solid knowledge of open access, they are less confident in their understanding of predatory practices and are seeking to increase their skills and knowledge in this regard to better support researchers at their institutions. To address this shortcoming, academic librarians in the region have expressed an interest in receiving training and in participating in international collaborations with other libraries that have already developed resources or programming in this area.}

To this end, a research model was developed based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, and resource dependence theory (RDT). Data from 175 valid questionnaires were collected from SME executives in Korea and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results of the analysis indicated that perceived usefulness did not influence SME executives’ intentions to adopt a smart factory. However, the perceived importance extracted from the RDT had a strong impact on SME executives’ intention to adopt a smart factory.

We specify and estimate a cross-sectional data model by generalized least squares (GLS) over the period of 1996–2020. Our results show that digital innovations (measured by researchers in R&D, firms in R&D, patents owed by residents, patents owed by non-residents) significantly reduce women’s entrepreneurship in Africa. Their effects are mediated by energy, female education, the internet, mobile phones, migration and marriage. We suggest strengthening the digital infrastructure for sustainable women’s entrepreneurship in Africa.}

It was mid-2014, and he contemplated the strategic significance of IT services to the organisation and the importance of its role in “determining the future”, as well as the gravity of decision making that would essentially pave the way to more effective and efficient support services. His office overlooked Albert Park, situated on the remains of Ranipuke, a volcanic cone in the centre of the city. The picturesque setting symbolised a 140-year-old, time-honoured sanctuary for Aucklanders. As he surveyed the manicured lawns and flower beds – with the elaborate fountain (1882) in view – he was struck by the serenity and permanence of the setting. For a moment, he considered maintaining the status quo within Information Technology Services. It had, after all, successfully delivered an organisational-wide service for decades. Albert Park had also been home to military barracks in the mid 1800s, where troops had been stationed for more than 20 years. Perhaps, a call to action would be better: to mobilise internal resources and embark on transformation. As he mulled over these alternatives, a third option came to mind: sourcing external support in this endeavour. He was still undecided as he gazed out of the window. He wondered which of these alternatives would deliver the best results and critically, which of them would stand the test of time.}

Using Giddens’ structuration as a framework, this article argues that structures such as time and organizational identity limit agency, but that journalists are more purposive actors than they are given credit. Agency can most clearly shape structure when new technology is introduced.}

abstract = {Several years since first emerging in Europe, platform work continues to represent a “social dilemma” for workers, social partners, policymakers and society as a whole. As a result of intense litigation, analysis and reporting, much is known about the contractual and working conditions in this growing labour market segment. While the European Union (EU) institutions are considering adopting a new Directive based on Art. 153 TFEU, there are a number of significant top-down and bottom-up national cases worth discussing. Workers across Europe have been reclassified by many courts; some governments have taken regulatory initiatives to address the risk of precariousness and have implemented new comprehensive legal instruments to safeguard a level playing field for both workers and platforms. This article discusses how existing and new domestic and EU labour law provisions can improve the labour conditions of platform workers. Its overarching goal is to address possible policy gaps and the implications for EU social law by exploring the lessons that can be drawn from recent policies and legal developments. Section two briefly touches upon the policymaking initiatives in France, Spain and Italy. Moreover, it presents and reviews the main outcomes of litigation at the domestic level, focusing on the pervasive role played by algorithmic management. After introducing the Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), section three critically analyses two key achievements at the EU level: the Directive on transparent and predictable working conditions and the Recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed. Section four explores the elasticity of the triad of Directives that regulate atypical forms of employment (part-time, fixed-term and temporary agency work). It is argued that the narrow construction of the Directives’ scope of application could represent an obstacle. However, an adaptive and purposive approach by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) could result in the classification of platform workers as falling within the scope of the social acquis in certain fields. Finally, section five concludes by providing concrete policy proposals focussed on cross-border issues, algorithmic transparency, the introduction of a presumption of employment status and collective bargaining.}

abstract = {High-quality news is important, not only for its own sake but also for its political implications. However, defining, operationalizing, and measuring news media quality is difficult, because evaluative criteria depend upon beliefs about the ideal society, which are inherently contested. This conceptual and methodological paper outlines important considerations for defining news media quality before developing and applying a multimethod approach to measure it. We refer to Giddens’ notion of double hermeneutics, which reveals that the ways social scientists understand constructs inevitably interact with the meanings of these constructs shared by people in society. Reflecting the two-way relationship between society and social sciences enables us to recognize news media quality as a dynamic, contingent, and contested construct and, at the same time, to reason our understanding of news media quality, which we derive from Habermas’ ideal of deliberative democracy. Moreover, we investigate the Swiss media system to showcase our measurement approach in a repeated data collection from 2017 to 2020. We assess the content quality of fifty news media outlets using four criteria derived from the deliberative ideal (N = 20,931 and 18,559 news articles and broadcasting items, respectively) and compare the results with those from two representative online surveys (N = 2,169 and 2,159 respondents). The high correlations between both methods show that a deliberative understanding of news media quality is anchored in Swiss society and shared by audiences. This paper shall serve as a showcase to reflect and measure news media quality across other countries and media systems.}

Until recently, the industry and researchers have conveyed a predominantly pessimistic view of the future. This paper argues that after numerous unsuccessful innovations, the industry is now in the middle of a global paradigm shift with a huge impact on journalism as a business and showing a promising path forward. The new “Readers First Paradigm” is replacing “Advertisers First” The former constitutes a new way of doing business, consisting of two main changes: a revised value proposition focusing on reader preferences and subscriptions; a fully digitized operational model built around AI and machine learning. The article shows that until recently, the paradigm shift has been largely overlooked by researchers in the field. Further, a theoretical framework of industrial paradigm shifts is developed to describe and explain the new paradigm’s emergence and growth. Additionally, a generic “ideal-type” systemic description of the paradigm is provided, identifying the individual components and how they work together.}

Sellers revealed a high degree of sensitivity to negative reviews, which, while infrequent, triggered feelings of anxiety and vulnerability. Their accounts exposed power asymmetries at two levels: the transactional level between sellers and customers and the governance level between sellers and eBay. Our findings highlight three main mechanisms underlying power asymmetries in this context. First, online customer evaluations have created a new form of employee monitoring in which power is exercised through the construction of visibility gaps between buyers and sellers and through an implicit coalition between buyers and the platform owner, who join together in the evaluation procedures. Second, by mediating and objectifying relations, algorithms reproduce power asymmetries among the different categories of actors, thereby constraining human agency. Third, online customer evaluations prompt sellers to exploit their practical knowledge of the algorithm to increase their agency. Through the lived experience of working for an algorithm, our findings contribute new understandings of power and agency in online work settings.}

In accordance with the law, employees are protected if they do not use their digital devices (computer, mobile phone, tablet, smart watch, etc.) during periods of rest, thereby, ensuring that their right to rest is enshrined within the regulations of their country; especially in light of the Working Time Directive 2003/88/EC. Therefore, from an analysis of French and Spanish legislation, the aim is to suggest pathways that could enable other countries to better regulate the right to disconnect, but also to develop EU law on the subject.}

A critical challenge faced by SME leaders, as a consequence of the continuing digital technology revolution, is how to optimally align business strategy with digital technology to fully leverage the potential offered by these technologies in pursuit of longevity and growth. There is a paucity of empirical research examining how e-leadership in SMEs drives successful alignment between business strategy and digital technology fostering longevity and growth. To address this gap, in this paper we develop an empirically derived e-leadership model. Initially we develop a theoretical model of e-leadership drawing on strategic alignment theory. This provides a theoretical foundation on how SMEs can harness digital technology in support of their business strategy enabling sustainable growth. An in-depth empirical study was undertaken interviewing 42 successful European SME leaders to validate, advance and substantiate our theoretically driven model. The outcome of the two stage process – inductive development of a theoretically driven e-leadership model and deductive advancement to develop a complete model through in-depth interviews with successful European SME leaders – is an e-leadership model with specific constructs fostering effective strategic alignment. The resulting diagnostic model enables SME decision makers to exercise effective e-leadership by creating productive alignment between business strategy and digital technology improving longevity and growth prospects.}

The results of the empirical analysis show that nowcasts generated results based on two data sources combined are superior to that based on a single data source.

abstract = {We show that proximity is significant during cloud computing’s adoption. This is counter to the prevailing assumptions of cloud adoption as being more impersonal and distant, with less interaction between provider and purchaser than on-premise technologies. We do this through an interpretive study of cloud computing adopters across Europe. We develop a conceptual framework of cloud proximity which draws attention to its locational, relational and temporal proximal dimensions. Our proximal analysis leads us to identify three aspects of cloud adoption where proximity plays a key role: mercantile aspect (e.g., cloud sales support), counsel aspect (e.g., access to internal and external expertise) and organi-technical aspect (e.g., the understanding of cloud technology and services alongside their organizational adoption context). By challenging assumptions of distant and remote adoption, we contribute to the cloud computing adoption research and raise questions for IT adoption in general.}

However, governments across the world are successfully continuing to restrict access to content that adversely affects their interests. This study examines the determinants of public support for censorship, as public support is likely to influence governments’ ability to regulate information. Using the Balance Theory and nationally representative survey data from Turkey, we analyze the support for censorship of both online and offline media. Our results suggest that pro-censorship attitudes are positively associated with peoples’ sympathy for the censor.}

abstract = {This teaching case introduces the concept of Impact Sourcing, in the context of global IT outsourcing. While IT outsourcing is a well-established management technique, with a history of at least 30 years, Impact Sourcing is a relatively new concept, conceptualized by the Rockefeller Foundation in 2011 and recently defined by the Global Impact Sourcing Coalition. To summarize this case, a First Nations band collaborated with a successful global outsourcing firm, Accenture, to establish Indigena, a Canadian-based impact-sourcing enterprise. Indigena found it difficult to attract, hire and retain qualified Aboriginal employees. The suburban office location in the high-cost Vancouver market may have been a key challenge in building a robust Aboriginal workforce. However, the challenge of winning outsourcing contracts in a competitive market may have been hindered by the Aboriginal workforce, despite the outward positive response of clients to the Impact Sourcing model. Indigena was not able to meet its social goals and at the same time it struggled to attract and retain clients. It was unable to demonstrate profitable business success, resulting in a strategic challenge from its investors.}

In this study, the interaction sequences during the paired programming of preservice teachers was investigated. Lag sequential analysis were used to explore students’ behavioral patterns in pair programming. The participants of the study consist of 14 students, seven pairs enrolled in a Programming Languages course. The findings indicate that there are significant behavioral learning sequences. During the program development process, students hesitated to create an algorithm and to improve an existing one while proposing the next step. In addition, they constantly waited for approval. Collaborative behaviors such as giving and receiving feedback and helping other partners were less observed in females. In addition, significant sequential driver and navigator behaviors were presented. The findings of the study have important implications for instructors and designers when using a pair programming approach in teaching programming. In the future, programming instruction environments can be designed by considering the learner behaviors that are presented in this study.}

Because African countries rank very low on the global measure of e-government readiness, critical variables were studied to find out which policy and programmatic areas should become priority in bridging the gap. Findings from a multiple regression analysis indicate that the low ranking of African countries on the global e-government readiness index indicates that the countries would need to develop, first, the internal utilization capacity as well as an enhanced public access to information, communication, and technology (ICT) infrastructures. These would, in turn, generate the demand necessary to spur increased government investment in ICT infrastructural development. What is mostly required is public sector leadership that creates the enabling environment for increased public and private sector participation in e-government interactions.}

Since luxury hotel properties have different operation strategies than limited-service hotels, their operational efficiency should be a reference during strategic decision-making processes. Primary research purpose is to identify the most efficient operation model for luxury hotel properties. The study computed operation efficiency scores using the data envelopment analysis approach to rank the property efficiency of 37 fully equipped luxury hotels in the United States. Each property can utilize slack analysis to discover a strategic benchmarking company (best efficient frontier) and intuitive strategic recommendations and gain superior input and output productivity. Tobit model analysis provides supplemental understandings regarding the additional operational factors impacting luxury hotel properties’ efficiency score variations. Operating efficiency was found to be achieved by multiple operating inputs and influenced by relative price, fixed costs, and management systems. Theoretical comprehensiveness of luxury service mix has been empirically tested by highlighting efficiency as a key measure. In addition, RevPAR’s ratio on TRevPAR further highlights the importance for luxury hotels to increase non-room sales and revenues to accomplish efficiency.}

Against that backdrop, we draw on the distinction between digital mediation and digital representation to investigate tensions in how actors transfer information across organizational and technological boundaries, how they translate information into meaning, and how they eventually transform information into action in digitalized work. We illustrate and develop this framing through detailed analyses of digitally enabled, condition-based maintenance of equipment in a mining context. Drawing on these analyses and extant literature, we advance theory on tensions in how digital technologies are implicated in producing and consuming information in today’s increasingly heterogeneous work practices.}

A total of 389 survey responses were collected online through a structured questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique from consumers of Delhi, India. A causal relationship established using Structural Equation Modelling reveals linkages of fear with panic buying and social media usage fully mediates this relationship, Further, the link between fear and online purchase is partially mediated by social media usage, and no linkage is found with impulse buying. ANOVA and T-test results show that panic buying tendency is higher in females and married individuals, social media usage is higher in unmarried younger age group people and online purchase intention is practiced more by males in middle- and upper-income groups. The study concludes by providing theoretical and practical implications.}

Semi-structured interviews were carried out in the USA and UK with regulators, tech firms, institutional and retail investors, and crypto social media influencers. Stakeholder groups were classified as interventionists, innovators, influencers, and investors. The research builds a data structure from extant literature and empirical research. Aggregate dimensions of inchoate technology, regulatory intervention, and innovation social norms reflect complex and competing stakeholder positions on crypto assets. Findings show crypto-assets are not homogenous, but highly differentiated with potential effects and outcomes determined by algorithmic code. However, competing stakeholder agendas obfuscate policy development for decentralized finance.}

In particular, given the greater portability of remote working associated with the drastic decline in personal mobility, it is hypothesized that these may have served as accelerators for distracted and aggressive driving. To answer these questions, an online survey was conducted in which 103 respondents were asked to report on their own and other drivers’ driving behavior. While respondents agreed they drove less frequently, they also indicated that they were not prone to more aggressive driving or engaging in potentially distracting activities whether for work or personal purposes. When asked to report on other motorists’ behavior, however, respondents indicated they had witnessed more aggressive and distracting drivers on the road after March 2020 relative to the time before the pandemic. These findings are reconciled with the existing literature on self-monitoring and self-enhancement bias, and the existing literature on the effect of comparable large-scale, disruptive events on traffic patterns is used to discuss the hypothesis on how driving patterns may change after the pandemic.}

While the COVID-19 pandemic poses a daunting challenge for the country, it has provided an opportunity for digital technology to be deployed in the fight against it. After COVID-19, it will be important to establish a model of governance that is compatible with digital technology, so a government with digital leadership will be a standard component of a digital society. Digital leadership and state capacity are theoretically based on the same foundation. Both are organic bodies supported by digital insights, digital decision-making, digital implementation and digital guidance, with digital thinking as the basis. All aspects collaborate throughout the process of state governance to assist its modernisation. Digital competence, platforms, government and talent should be improved as part of digital leadership.}

It is a dynamic relationship as employees deliberately manage and change their psychological contract over time. Triggers seem to be the drivers underpinning this dynamism. Yet little is known about how these triggers operate and affect the psychological contract. To address this, we explore triggers and their impact using a 6-week daily diary study (N = 117). We found a linear chain of positive relationships from initial triggers to connectedness of past triggers, to the experience of negative emotions, to the expected reoccurrence of the initial trigger, ultimately disrupting the psychological contract. The findings revealed the dynamic effect of triggers on the employment relationship, not only by exposing the underlying micro-processes, but also by revealing that the impact of triggers can linger for approximately 11 days before leveling off. These findings suggest that the psychological contract may fluctuate on a daily basis due to the influence of triggers. The theoretical implications for understanding the dynamic nature of the psychological contract are discussed in relation to the disruptive role of triggers.}

While research on gacha games – and the specific role of loot boxes therein – has emphasised their associations with gambling, I contend that affect is another trigger that can motivate seemingly irrational playing behaviours. The affective embeddings of gacha games motivate players to curate aesthetic assemblages of virtual content that enable the mediated expression of the self. Drawing on qualitative data generated among young Singapore-based players of gacha games, I explore how the acquisition of characters, skins and collections can be motivated by the emotional payoff that comes from relationality rather than gambling.}

abstract = {Currently, due to the rare consideration on the coupling of the various rolling joints and their directional dynamic parameters, and the constraints of the traditional modeling methods, the dynamic modeling precision of the ball screw feed system and the dynamic parameters identification accuracy of the rolling joints are difficult to be further improved. In this paper, a novel method to identify the dynamic parameters of rolling joints based on the digital twin dynamic model of the assembled ball screw feed system is proposed. Firstly, synchronizing information of the physical entity, the geometric model is constructed. Then the finite element analysis (FEA) model is constructed which can simultaneously consider multiple rolling joints and their dynamic parameters at multiple directions. Based on the FEA modal data, the deep neural network (DNN) model is constructed to reflect the mapping between the dynamic parameters and the natural frequencies. Thus, the digital twin dynamic model can be established by fusion of these sub-models. Combining the digital twin-driven and experimental natural frequencies, the optimization model is built, and the dynamic parameters can be identified by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Finally, the relative error of dynamic parameters identification is less than 3%, which indicates that the proposed method is feasible, effective, and has greater accuracy.}

When the COVID-19 pandemic impeded street protests in spring 2020, SMOs had to adapt their strategies to online-only formats. We analyze the German-language Twitter communication of the climate movement Fridays for Future (FFF) before and during the lockdown to explain how SMOs adapted their strategy under online-only conditions. We collected (re-)tweets containing the hashtag #fridaysforfuture (N = 46,881 tweets, N = 225,562 retweets) and analyzed Twitter activity, use of hashtags, and predominant topics. Results show that although the number of tweets was already steadily declining before, it sharply dropped during the lockdown. Moreover, the use of hashtags changed substantially and tweets focused increasingly on thematic discourses and debates around the legitimacy of FFF, while tweets about protests and calls for mobilization decreased.}

Based on a field study at an AI company, this article studies how AI is performed as developers enact two predictive systems along with stakeholders in public sector accounting and public sector healthcare. Inspired by STS theories about values in design, we analyze our empirical data focusing especially on how objectives, structured performances, and divisions of labor are built into the two systems and at whose expense. Our findings reveal that the development of the two AI systems is informed by politically motivated managerial interests in cost-efficiency. This results in AI systems that are (1) designed as managerial tools meant to enable efficiency improvements and cost reductions, and (2) enforced on professionals on the “shop floor” in a top-down manner. Based on our findings and a discussion drawing on literature on the original visions of human-centered systems design from the 1960s, we argue that turning AI into IA seems dubious, and ask what human-centered AI really means and whether it remains an ideal not easily realizable in practice. More work should be done to rethink human-machine relationships in the age of big data and AI, in this way making the call for ethical and responsible AI more genuine and trustworthy.}

The results indicate that relative advantage, top management support, cost-effectiveness, competitive pressure, vendor support, compatibility, AI strategic alignment and availability of resources, positively influence the intention to adopt AI-based technologies. The analysis demonstrated that the influence of market uncertainty on adoption intentions is insignificant. It was found that government regulation and complexity negatively influence adoption intentions. The findings of the study would be valuable for AI-based technology providers, IT managers and top management in organizations, and government bodies, in terms of building effective policies to promote the successful adoption of AI-based technologies.}

This article focuses on the structural changes in agricultural technology in terms of patent applications by specific technology sector between the two periods: Period 1 (2000–2007) and Period 2 (2008–2015). Accordingly, we performed centrality analysis to measure the importance of each agricultural technology based on International Patent Classification (IPC) sub-classes. We also conducted citation analysis to identify whether the proportion of backward and forward citations of agricultural patents had significantly changed between the two periods. The results of the centrality analysis suggest that, whereas food technology was the most important technology sector in agriculture during both the periods, agricultural production technology experienced a considerable increase in its share in agriculture in Period 2. The results of the citation analysis confirm a substantial degree of interconnectivity between agricultural technology and non-agricultural technologies.}

Although scholars have expressed an interest in studying RBSOs, nobody has incorporated the three different perspectives into a single integrated model. Therefore, the present article aims to develop a holistic theoretical framework, studying the human, financial, technological and social resources of an RBSO and highlighting whether the EO influences an RBSO during its generation and development phases. A case study from the information and communication technology sector was selected, and data were collected through a structured questionnaire complemented with in-depth and on-site interviews. The holistic framework adopted allowed to highlight the peculiarities of the RBSO: the marked vocation for scientific research, the EO of the founding team and the important role of the parent organization, mostly in supplying intangible assets. The emerged evidence shows how it is possible to generate and develop a successful RBSO, providing useful insights from both academic and managerial viewpoints.}

The study employs a mixed research approach with a descriptive research design. Structured questionnaires, focus group discussions and key informant interviews are used to collect data from local communities residing inside and adjacent areas of Nech Sar National Park in Ethiopia. The results reveal that the local communities around the national park are exposed to various shocks and vulnerability contexts such as poverty, food insecurity, and resource use conflict. Consumptive resource usage, recurring fire catastrophes, agricultural encroachment, and illegal fishing are all threatening the park’s biodiversity conservation efforts. Despite the impact of tourism on their livelihoods is marginal, local grassroots have a positive attitude towards the development of community-based tourism. Community-based tourism development which provides alternative livelihood options to local grassroots around protected areas can play significant role in the conservation of biodiversity and alleviating poverty.}

Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee’s body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance. Taking an employee-centric position, it also proposes a research agenda for critical, behavioral, and design-oriented scholars who wish to explore the identified issues.}

The paper presents a survey answered by 106 legal professionals from 19 countries exploring four thematic areas referring to human capital, social capital, knowledge and technology transfer that were hypothesised to define innovation. Ordered probit regression modelling was used. Evidence is presented that cybersecurity threats, inadequate and limited training on IT, excessive paperwork and lack of efficient teamwork, collaboration and communication are key challenges to innovation adoption, which is a pathway to sustainable, inclusive and resilient firm growth. Firm size and internationalisation are innovation-altering factors; SMEs differ from large global firms in their ability to operate “outside-the-box”. Our results recommend that legal enterprises need to adopt innovation as a robust transformation-enabling toolkit that could facilitate a performance-enhancing business ethos.}

abstract = {This paper offers a theoretical model to analyse an example of Indigenous media through an Indigenous lens and discusses its potential to increase audiences in other alternative media. Adapted from New Zealand Māori filmmaker and philosopher Barry Barclay’s idea of the “fourth cinema” and a metaphorical “communications marae”,1 the model has been applied to New Zealand’s Indigenous broadcaster, Māori Television. This article discusses the model and suggests that the “communications marae” has the potential to be used by non-mainstream media providers to, not only address their own audiences, but also to enrol wider communities in alternative perspectives to the “mainstream”. Research has demonstrated how Indigenous broadcasting can serve its own audience while also attracting wider, non-Indigenous audiences. However, this paper’s focus is a case study of migrants engaging with Māori Television because it is migrants who frequently operate outside of established power relationships and represent an often unrecognised niche audience segment in mainstream media. The model demonstrates the potential pedagogical role of the broadcaster and how its content can make a positive difference to migrants’ lives and attitudes towards Indigenous people through its ability to counter the, often negative, representations of Indigeneity in mainstream media. Outside of Māori Television, migrants have limited access to an Indigenous perspective on the nation’s issues and concerns, which calls into question both democracy and migrants’ ability to engage in civic society. Migrants need information to negotiate and weigh up important tensions and polarities, to understand multiple perspectives inherent to democratic living and to evaluate issues of social justice and to solve problems based on the principles of equity. Indigenous media, as in all alternative media, has a role to play in questioning or challenging accepted thinking and to present counter hegemonic discourses to all citizens in participatory democratic societies.}

abstract = {This study aims to theoretically advance the context-oriented tradition in crisis communication by highlighting the political and technological contexts for understanding organisational crises. Using China as a case, the study proposes a broader analytical framework that investigates the societal contexts’ impact on crisis communication from political and technological domains. The analytical framework includes, first, the examination of the authoritarian regime with a divided power structure as the political context in China. Assessing political ideology, political structure, and political history as political contexts allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of political contexts on crisis communication temporally and structurally; second, the investigation of internet users’ voices in a government-regulated commercial space as the technological context in China. Online participation and internet language thereby emerge as prominent parts of the technological contexts for understanding crisis communication in China. The implications and directions of research are also discussed.}

These are fundamental questions for family business and entrepreneurship research. In particular, the multigenerational dimension of entrepreneurial families (EFs) and the new family logics that emerge as the family grows may lead to different types of entrepreneurial activities. To shed light on these questions, we conduct a systematic literature review of 90 peer-reviewed articles focusing on the characteristics and behaviours of EFs, family members and their business activities. Specifically, we first identify and categorise the family-related factors characterising EFs across generations. Second, we link the identified factors to different types of entrepreneurial activities pursued as the generations advance, distinguishing two dimensions: mode of organising (internal vs. external), and degree of relatedness (related vs. unrelated). Finally, we highlight the main gaps in the literature and provide a future research agenda.}

Such affordances refer to properties of these platforms (including personalized recommendations and easy-to-navigate interfaces) that provoke certain uses of the technology and satisfy social and psychological needs. Based on a quantitative study of 25–50-year-olds in Belgium (N = 596) and a hierarchical regression analysis, the study builds further on the conceptualization of technological affordances as presented in the MAIN model, which suggests that four affordances (Modality, Agency, Interactivity and Navigability) are central to digital media technology. As such, the study presents an affordance-based measure of video streaming platforms, and helps to understand how video streaming technology shapes new patterns of audiovisual consumption and enhances the viewing experience beyond that of traditional television. Whereas most research attention has focused on user-oriented gratifications of video streaming platforms, this study addresses a gap in the literature by dealing with platform-oriented gratifications of video streaming platforms.}

This study presents a theoretical discussion on how DFSs play an important role in promoting China’s inclusive finance. This study uses the systematic review method of qualitative sampling to achieve the goal of this study. Different forces play different roles behind the promotion of inclusive finance. However, DFSs are considered to be one of the most influential forces in the development of inclusive finance in the present world. Many examples of how DFS can improve inclusive finance are discussed in the literature. In addition, different contributions to DFS usage are presented here to achieve the objectives of this study. The contents of the study contributed to a better understanding of the practical impact and implication of DFS tools in transforming the financial sector. In this study, first, a structured review method is followed; second, most important discussion on the contribution of DFS in promoting inclusive finance is presented and third, the relation between the topic and related research is identified.}

Nurses caring for children with indwelling central venous catheters in 3 high-risk units were eligible to participate. All other units served as controls. The intervention was a 12-month nonrandomized quality improvement study of CLABSI App implementation with interunit competitions. Compared to the preceding year, the intervention group (9886 line days) CLABSI rate decreased by 48% (P = .03). Controls (7879 line days) did not change significantly. In all, 105 unique intervention group nurses completed 673 self-assessments. Competitions were associated with increased engagement as measured by self-assessments and unique participants. This model could be extended to other health care–associated infections, and more broadly to process improvement within and across health care systems.}

Governments have several times declared smart, partial or full lockdowns to deal with the health crisis situation, that has impacted the social activities, gatherings and has impacted the functionality of several professions, including education that are directly or indirectly impacted by the lockdowns. In the education environment the students in large numbers are expected to gather for lectures, labs and meet folks from industry and/or other sectors. The lockdown required the teachers to come up with alternative to meeting in person to online meetings and adapting to online-synchronous and asynchronous teaching styles. To meet the targets set for an academic year, a distinctive rise in e-learning has been observed where teaching and learning is undertaken remotely using digital platforms. This study aims to reveal the impact of computer-assisted teaching on the development of technostress among Pakistani teachers during the pandemic COVID-19. In addition, the role of teachers’ self-efficacy is evaluated and motivation to leave the teaching profession is investigated in the coming endemic climate. The researchers have opted to a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional survey to generalize the statistically obtained results and test hypotheses. A total of 242 teachers at different levels of education voluntarily participated in the research during the lockdown from March to April 2020, where all regular educational activities were suspended and online classes were introduced as an alternative way to meet educational goals. The findings revealed that Learning Teaching Process Oriented and Technical Issues Oriented are the main contributing factors towards the development of technology stress and motivation to leave the teaching profession. Moreover, teachers’ perception of self-efficacy in using computers is negatively associated with technology stress. It is recommended that computer-based instructional coaching be designed for teachers prior to engaging them in digitally oriented online courses to improve their self-efficacy in using computers and to promote a well-developed digital infrastructure to avoid the development of technology stress and discouragement for tutelage.}

Therefore, this study investigates graduate employability concerns and the perceptions of undergraduate students regarding employment prospects and future job security confidence in their disciplines’ industry sectors in light of this global crisis. Through the employment of a mixed methods design, the study investigates the perceptions of graduating students from three disciplines in Singapore: Tourism, Communications and Information Technology. The findings indicate that COVID-19 had a positive impact on perceptions of jobs that could be performed from home and those in essential services. Concurrently, there were notable variances in the students’ perceptions regarding career prospects and job security confidence across the three disciplines with regard to the impact of the crisis on their industry sectors in general and themselves individually.}

The article contributes to understandings of transparency as value cocreation in business-to-business markets. Through field-level discourse analysis, the article shows that transparency is contingent primarily on the nature of the market, in this case, a platformized industry, which valorizes transparency as part of a regime of data sharing and open access. Transparency is further contingent on the market actor: actors with lesser status and market legitimacy are more likely to seek to cocreate transparency with market actors of greater or similar status and legitimacy. The article concludes that in commercial spaces, publicity’s relationship to transparency is not only determined by market logic, but that all market logics are being drawn further toward a technological definition of transparency as “shareveillance,” as more segments of economic life become platformized.}

There is a growing body of literature on data-oriented activism which aims to resist and counteract existing harmful data practices. However, little is known about the processes, policies, and political-economic structures that make datafication possible. There is a distinct research gap on situated and context-specific empirical research, which critically interrogates the premises, interests, and agendas of data-driven public administration and how stakeholders can impact them. This paper therefore studies the conditions of participation in public administration datafication. It asks the overall research question of how citizens are problematized and included in policy and practitioner discourse in the datafication of public administration. The paper takes Norway as its case and applies Cardullo and Kitchin’s scaffold of smart citizen participation at the system level. It makes use of a unique empirical insight into the field, consisting of a survey, interviews, and an extensive document analysis. Unexpectedly, we find that citizens and civil society are rarely engaged in this administrative reform. Instead, we identify a paternalistic, top-down, technocratic approach where the context, values, and agendas of datafication are obscured from the citizen.}

In Europe, concerns about data-driven market power have led policymakers to propose far-reaching regulations of information technology (IT) in these markets. Despite the global policy relevance, the regulation of big data and its competitive effects has so far received little attention in information systems (IS) research. This article addresses this research gap by developing an overarching framework for future IS research on the role of IT for the regulation of data-driven market power. The proposed research framework builds upon a three-part analysis: First, we review the academic literature and show that there is extensive, although nuanced, empirical evidence for business value creation from big (user) data. Second, we draw on the resource-based view of the firm and recent policy reports to derive six facilitating factors that enable firms to establish market power based on sustained data-driven competitive advantages. Third, we characterize three regulatory approaches to govern market power and competition in data-driven digital markets: (i) empowering consumers, (ii) data openness, and (iii) limiting data scale. For each of these approaches, we highlight the key role of IT artifacts in mediating the effect of regulatory rules on actual practice.}

Applying system generalized method of moments and dynamic fixed-effects estimators, the results show there is a positive and significant relationship between TELCOM and tourist arrivals. We also find that a stronger relationship between the public and private sectors magnifies the positive effect of TELCOM on inbound tourism.

The research methods included theoretical and analytical research methods, the methodology of empirical research, and comparative research methods. The latest works of PA scholars in the global context, the materials of the study provided by the teams of teachers of the leading Russian universities concerning teaching experience during 2020, and the latest data provided from the analysis carried out at the Institute for Social Sciences of Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, Moscow, in the conditions of distant and mixed learning in 2020–2021, allowed the author to give some practical advice to teachers and education managers concerning the improvement of the educational programs for PA students regarding the new conditions of the study. The main conclusion made on the results of the analysis is that digitalization of teaching and learning process and organization of distant learning at the time of the Covid-19 Pandemic should be considered to be the most important issues in PA education which could be applied in PA education in future. The recommendations concerned such aspects as the development of digital competencies of students, distant regime implementation, new pedagogy and digital didactics, socialization of students, internationalization and academic mobility of students, improving the qualifications of teachers and university management teams, research work, and the development of meta-competencies of future public servants.}

abstract = {Although journalism has an important social impact, with contributions from multiple academic and professional fields, one can perceive a major deficit in terms of applying scientometric analyses that allow for an objective multidimensional radiography of scientific production, the identification of transnational collaboration networks and the revelation of the position of the different countries. This work evaluated the evolution of national scientific domains of the discipline during the period 2003–2009, constructing a first relationships map that goes beyond the quantitative plane of production to reveal the dynamics and socio-political and geographical context of alliances in Journalism research. Scientific production in journalism increased during this period much faster than world scientific production. Three countries really capitalized the research: the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain generated more than half of the total production, while at the same time being those that determined the entire structure of relationships involving the linguistic, geopolitical and sociocultural (linked with professional and work practices) factors.}

abstract = {Recent studies show that many workers consider their jobs socially useless. Thus, several explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. David Graeber’s “bullshit jobs theory”, for example, claims that some jobs are in fact objectively useless, and that these are found more often in certain occupations than in others. Quantitative research on Europe, however, finds little support for Graeber’s theory and claims that alienation may be better suited to explain why people consider their jobs socially useless. This study extends previous analyses by drawing on a rich, under-utilized dataset and provides new evidence for the United States specifically. Contrary to previous studies, it thus finds robust support for Graeber’s theory on bullshit jobs. At the same time, it also confirms existing evidence on the effects of various other factors, including alienation. Work perceived as socially useless is therefore a multifaceted issue that must be addressed from different angles.}

With a rapid surge in the growth of digital platforms, and the success of China’s platforms outside China, the aspiration to be entrepreneurial is recognized and celebrated. Increasingly, women are benefitting from this entrepreneurial fever. However, behind the increasing number of emerging women digital entrepreneurs, is the struggle to gain recognition. Drawing on cases studies of female digital startups, the article investigates some of the dilemmas faced when women strive to develop entrepreneurial identities. The article problematizes distinctions between the entrepreneur in a general sense, the creative entrepreneur, and female creative entrepreneurs. Whereas an entrepreneur in China is often conflated with a business owner, the identity of the creative entrepreneur is more precarious and unstable. The article finds that besides the difficulty to sustain a creative-based entrepreneurial identity, the hyper-competitive and masculinist fields of digital entrepreneurship and technical fields, combined with traditional gender roles and family responsibility, results in a devaluation of female entrepreneurship.}

The aim of the article is to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technology on the international posting of workers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic on example of the German chemical industry. The basis of the analysis are two factor conditions of the Diamond Model of M.E. Porter: innovation and human capital. A qualitative study was conducted with experts in Industry 4.0 that regularly post workers. The results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of technology adoption (especially Augmented Reality cluster). Industry 4.0 technologies enable companies to reduce the posting of workers. For this purpose, IT skills are now the most important, followed by communication, flexibility, and openness, as well as soft, team and didactic skills. JEL Codes: F23, J61, O33}

The main innovative feature of the project is focused on the usability assessment of the video-guide indoor location-based system. The article addresses the first phase of a more complex project, analyzing the behavior of architecture students previously trained in modeling of complex buildings, in order to improve the system for a second phase that will be developed with students with special needs. Using an indoor location system for watching multimedia contents, we can improve the access, the visit, and the spatial perception of historical places for all kinds of students, with or without any special requirements. The results show a lack of usability of the system, especially due to the design of the mobile interface and to some loss of synchronization between the student position and the multimedia contents. However, the students have a better understanding of the museum’s characteristics because of multimedia content, as a clear improvement compared with the classic audio-guide.}

Even though their use might affect patients’ health and data security, they have rarely found their way into organizational knowledge management strategies. We present the current state of research regarding the prevalence, patterns, and trends of smartphone and tablet usage among physicians in clinical practice. Five electronic databases were searched for quantitative studies. The extracted data were systematically analyzed and visualized in boxplots. The results show an increasing prevalence of smartphones and medical apps in clinical practice, especially among junior physicians. Current applications can be subdivided into four categories: Communication and Organization, Documentation and Monitoring, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Decision Support, and Education. Among them, there is a large number of applications with a direct impact on physicians’ clinical actions and therefore on patients’ health and data security. In consequence, healthcare organizations should systematically integrate mobile devices and apps into their knowledge management strategies, including a modern IT infrastructure and training courses. Further studies are necessary to identify organizational and external factors that support an efficient mobile device usage during clinical practice.}

Particularly the study examines the moderating influence of perceived government support (PGS) on m-government services usage. A structural equation model (SEM) method was deployed with Smart PLS 3.0. Analysis from the data captured using a comprehensive Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, demonstrated that contrary to the initial held view, performance expectancy (PE) did not impact the acceptance behavior of m-government services. Facilitating conditions, security and privacy, trust in m-government and quality of information had a direct positive influence on m-government services adoption. The findings also revealed that PGS had a significant moderating influence on PE, facilitation conditions, and trust towards the adoption of mobile government services. However, perceived government support had no significant moderating effect on security and privacy and information quality on the adoption of m-government services. These results guide researchers and practitioners in respect of the role government support plays in making m-government a success and how government aid should be designed to have the maximum impact on changing the adoption behavior of citizens.}

DBEs feature unique economic, technological, business, and growth characteristics that increase their opacity to consumers, competition enforcers, and lawmakers. These include a range of market failures, the role of cloud computing in realizing the DBE value proposition, and growth through acquisition.The United States is making slow progress in addressing competition concerns in the digital sector. Legislative initiatives remain focused on the largest players, and there is little political appetite for a dedicated sector regulator to develop a system of non-discrimination “access” regulation. This article discusses the implications of the widening gap between the complexity and growth of DBEs, and policy responses to the market power problems they raise. The analysis recommends a more coherent approach centered on identifying policy tools—including antitrust, regulation, and privacy law—that are best suited to addressing the unique features of DBEs and that work in a complementary way.}

The current study explores the e-reading consumption experience among Pakistani generation X readers (Xers) through the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), along with TPB model validation through a larger sample. A mixed-method research design (exploratory sequential) was employed. The study was completed in two phases; the first phase was qualitative based on nine (n = 9) in-depth face-to-face interviews. In the second phase, a quantitative research design was employed. A survey questionnaire was developed based on the TPB model and outcomes of the first phase, and the data were collected from 250 Xers from Pakistani public libraries. The first phase outlined numerous positive consequences and challenges specific to the behavioural beliefs. The circle of friends, colleagues and supervisors encourage e-reading consumption given the benefits, speed, and saver of time, cost, and effort, to name a few. Notably, e-reading consumption intention leaves no alternative for Xers in the digital information era. The results of second phase show that seven out of nine proposed hypotheses were supported significantly H2 (β = 0.33, p = .00), H3 (β = 0.20, p = .02), H4 (β = 0.27, p = .00), H6 (β = 0.22, p = .01), H7 (β = 0.18, p = .03), H8 (β = .28, p = .00) and H9 (β = −0.15, p = .04), whereas H1 (β = −0.03, p = .66) and H5 (β = −0.02, p = .73) were rejected. The current study extends the theoretical foundations of TPB in the age of digital information consumption by exploring dimensions qualitatively and tested that proposed relationship quantitatively from a developing country context, Pakistani Xers.}

We investigated how often and in which contexts women are represented in Swiss news media articles between 2011 and 2019 (n = 77,427) by combining manual and automated content analysis on a large scale. We looked at representation in general and the dependence of topic and media type, in addition to the influence of two resource-related features of news content: the source and the format. The study showed clear gender imbalances, which were heavily dependent on the topics in the news coverage. We found that when journalists relied on original reporting instead of news agencies and used contextualizing formats women were more frequently mentioned in the news. Our results, therefore, suggest that resources can situationally determine the representation of women in the news.}

abstract = {With the profound transformation of Chinese journalism under the commercialized trend of thoughts, there is a debate on whether Chinese journalists still maintain the public service ideal or just regard it simply as a job. In other words, is journalism a “vocation” or a “profession”? Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an empirical study on journalistic roles. Drawing on the self-determination theory, this study constructs a framework of “career motivation–news attitude” to build a bridge between role orientations and performance, in order to comprehensively understand the Chinese journalistic roles. In this study, a quota sampling survey (n = 1000), multiple linear regression (MLR), and structural equation modeling (SEM) are used to examine the influence of advocacy and utilitarian motivations on news efficacy and news avoidance, corresponding to news production and consumption attitudes. Furthermore, the study divides the journalistic roles in China into four categories: purposive advocate professionals, dedicated advocate professionals, workaday journalists, and adrift journalists. The results show that advocacy motivation, or the public service ideal, is more significant than utilitarian motivation in the journalistic roles. The former is associated with higher news efficacy and lower news avoidance, while the latter is only associated with higher news avoidance. The study also discusses the demographic factors of journalistic career motivations.}

abstract = {Today’s communicative environment, including the rise of social media, makes journalists perform publicly as both professionals and private citizens. In these circumstances, practices of self-limitation and self-censorship may extend to online behaviour. In this article, we analyse what makes journalists in public affairs media limit themselves in expression, both in editorial production and in online posting. We ask whether their self-censoring is related to personal, editorial, or external factors; whether political threats triumph over personal self-branding and professional/commercial reasons and whether these factors work differently in editorial and online behaviour; and whether journalists behave differently on different social networks. To formulate the answers, we use the results of a survey of 95 journalists from 51 Russian regions and seven in-depth interviews. Our results show that, in an organisationally weak journalistic community that operates in a restrictive environment, understanding of self-censorship differs significantly from that in Western democracies. It includes both self-limiting under pressures and personal-level ethical decisions that substitute professional codes of conduct. Moreover, for online posting and editorial work, there are different dominant “perceived censors”. Political threats remain the most significant of all external pressures both online and offline, but personal motives lead the decision-making in posting on social networks. Russia is characterised by platform-wide echo-chambering and high differentiation between users of Facebook and the Russia-based VK.com (formerly Vkontakte). We observe this difference in journalists’ descriptions of self-limitation on these networks.}

abstract = {Extant literature has studied how customer–salesperson price negotiations evolve in “normal” circumstances. However, recent economic recessions illustrate the need to advance theory on the question of how price negotiations evolve in “abnormal” times when customer demand significantly contracts beyond expected variation. In response to this gap in the literature, this study uses a multi-method design to investigate price negotiations during exceptional demand contractions. Our results from a theories-in-use study reveal that during such circumstances, salespeople’s perceived dependency on customers increases while customers’ perceived dependency on salespeople decreases. The inherent “power shift” should benefit customers in subsequent price negotiations. However, customers are less likely to capitalize on their power if they have a close relationship with a salesperson, implying that salespeople do not have to concede on price negotiations. This effect is likely due to increased sympathy during periods of exceptional demand contractions. The authors further validate key propositions from this qualitative study in a field study and a scenario-based experiment. Altogether, this study suggests that managers should not be too hasty in approving and encouraging salespeople to offer unnecessary price discounts during exceptional demand contractions as buyers may become more sympathetic and lenient during price negotiations.}

Hidden behind recent developments is over 30 years of research and development by scholars in the field of Planning Support Systems (PSS), although to date there have been few attempts to systematically characterise their output or achievements. This paper reports on the results of a citation network analysis (CNA) on the PSS literature contained within the Scopus database, a systematic method to describe the overall structure of the field, mapping out of key research streams and how they change over time. The analysis reveals 27 distinct research streams under four themes, split between technical and applied research. There is strong evidence of a field still clearly defined by its roots in comprehensive software systems used for scenario and land use planning although shifting over time from a focus on the development of modelling techniques to applied research and case studies in the use of applications. Research output has remained steady in the context of exponential growth in related literature including smart cities, urban science and urban analytics. These findings support calls for a refreshed approach to the field as planning support science and the map produced by this analysis provides a valuable framework to navigate past research efforts to inform a new era of digital planning efforts.}

abstract = {Data analytics provides versatile decision support to help employees tackle the rising complexity of today’s business decisions. Notwithstanding the benefits of these systems, research has shown their potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. While technical causes have been studied, the human side has been mostly neglected, albeit employees mostly still need to decide to turn analytics recommendations into actions. Drawing upon theories of technology dominance and of moral disengagement, we investigate how task complexity and employees’ expertise affect the approval of discriminatory data analytics recommendations. Through two online experiments, we confirm the important role of advantageous comparison, displacement of responsibility, and dehumanization, as the cognitive moral disengagement mechanisms that facilitate such approvals. While task complexity generally enhances these mechanisms, expertise retains a critical role in analytics-supported decision-making processes. Importantly, we find that task complexity’s effects on users’ dehumanization vary: more data subjects increase dehumanization, whereas richer information on subjects has the opposite effect. By identifying the cognitive mechanisms that facilitate approvals of discriminatory data analytics recommendations, this study contributes toward designing tools, methods, and practices that combat unethical consequences of using these systems.}

The primary aim of our review is to systematically identify and critically review the literature on sustainable innovation in H&T amid COVID-19 (conducted in 2020 and 2021), in order to synthesize and classify prevalent types, antecedents, and outcomes of sustainable innovation. The authors present a comprehensive review of the 58 articles on sustainable innovation in H&T through the Web of Science (WoS) database, spanning over 2 years (2020–2021). This review demonstrates that since the beginning of COVID-19, H&T have strongly mobilized network technologies (especially social media and digital platforms) and data-processing technologies (especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)) in comparison with physical-digital interface technologies (especially Virtual Reality (VR)), while physical-digital process technologies remain very limited in these industries. Several relevant antecedents of the adoption of sustainable innovation, more specifically digital technologies, have been identified at multiple levels of analysis, including the organizational, managerial, and stakeholder levels. Our research also reveals several consequences of the adoption of sustainable innovation in H&T. These consequences were congregated according to the three main dimensions related to sustainability in economic, social, and environmental outcomes. This study provides important practical implications for the H&T sectors in the digital era and post-pandemic. The current research is the first study to systematically and critically review sustainable innovation in an H&T context.}

abstract = {Increasingly, people are turning to social media to express grief. By and large, however, the social media community can do little more than improvise reactions, not quite sure how to use the old familiar social scripts as guides to lending effective support. To examine the role of social media in the grieving process, we used a mixed-methods approach: 12 interviews with “social media grievers” reveal the expectations of the bereaved regarding other users’ behavior. By way of two online experiments with 1058 participants, we tested how these expectations are met by the messaging of social media providers in accordance with social norm theory. We found that injunctive social norm messages are particularly effective, whereas descriptive social norm messages vary in their effectiveness, depending on which information is presented and how prominently so. What our study shows, then, is that both are potent socio-technical tools that can guide users towards more empathetic behavior when dealing with the bereaved, so while social media may not be a substitute for therapy, they can offer profound comfort for those of us dealing with bereavement and grief.}

The data was gathered using a quantitative technique based on questionnaires to study a total of 206 accountants and auditors, and was analysed using the PLS-SEM method to determine influential factors and their relationships. In addition, we compare the PLS-SEM results with a recently established approach of panel data fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results reveal that the components of finance, tasks, technology, epidemics, knowledge readiness and trust all have a favourable impact on the use of AI in Accounting and Auditing in Vietnam. Besides, the fsQCA results are consistent with the PLS-SEM method, which means that our findings are robust and valid. This study adds empirical evidence to the scientific literature on AI in Accounting and Auditing, which will be immensely beneficial for legislators and businesses looking to improve company efficiency. Besides, applying the fsQCA approach contributes significantly to the existing literature about the research method.}

We conclude that the more the initiatives come from a company’s top-management overall ecosystem transformation, the more likely NIT adoption will fit into a general strategy for a brand-strengthening process and the more it will be effective. This exploratory analysis opens up a path for building new frameworks to measure a company’s degree of involvement with and usage of interactive technologies.}

From a historical perspective, each technological breakthrough has affected education by changing how symbols are represented and how knowledge is carried. The emergence of new educational technology is always accompanied by doubt, vigilance, and rejection from the traditional community. The new educational technology, generative artificial intelligence, interacts with the old, creating an increasingly complex ecology of educational technology. Three suggestions are proposed for adjusting the education system: first, promoting small-scale, individualized, and conversational teaching in schools; second, developing teachers’ and students’ digital literacy in a multi-curricula system; and third, conducting research on grading and classification standards for the application of AI in education.}

VI is contextualized with the inclusiveness of international experiences and with external challenges to internationalization (posed, for example, by the Covid-19 pandemic). Conceived as an institution-spanning concept, VI is developed from the ACE-CIGE model of Comprehensive Internationalization. It is inferred from actual practice based on a content analysis of conference abstracts from relevant fields, employing coding and computer-assisted text analysis (CATA). Based on the findings, the VI concept includes strategies and articulated institutional commitment as a transversal category and online and distance education (ODE) as an additional category in contrast to the concept of Comprehensive Internationalization. This research furthermore considers two dimensions of VI: one that is directly internationalization-related and the other concerned with broader aims of the combination of the virtual and the international. It concludes with a perspective on a “new normal” of hybrid internationalization in higher education.}

abstract = {Worldwide, governments have introduced novel information and communication technologies (ICTs) for policy formulation and service delivery, radically changing the working environment of government employees. Following the debate on work stress and particularly on technostress, we argue that the use of ICTs triggers “digital overload” that decreases government employees’ job satisfaction via inhibiting their job autonomy. Contrary to prior research, we consider job autonomy as a consequence rather than a determinant of digital overload, because ICT-use accelerates work routines and interruptions and eventually diminishes employees’ freedom to decide how to work. Based on novel survey data from government employees in Germany, Italy, and Norway, our structural equation modeling (SEM) confirms a significant negative effect of digital overload on job autonomy. More importantly, job autonomy partially mediates the negative relationship between digital overload and job satisfaction, pointing to the importance of studying the micro-foundations of ICT-use in the public sector.}

abstract = {With the first commercially available smart insulin pens, the predominant insulin delivery device for millions of people living with diabetes is now coming into the digital age. Smart insulin pens (SIPs) have the potential to reshape a connected diabetes care ecosystem for patients, providers, and health systems. Existing SIPs are enhanced with real-time wireless connectivity, digital dose capture, and integration with personalized dosing decision support. Automatic dose capture can promote effective retrospective review of insulin dose data, particularly when paired with glucose data. Patients, providers, and diabetes care teams will be able to make increasingly data-driven decisions and recommendations, in real time, during scheduled visits, and in a more continuous, asynchronous care model. As SIPs continue to progress along the path of digital transformation, we can expect additional benefits: iteratively improving software, machine learning, and advanced decision support. Both these technological advances, and future care delivery models with asynchronous interactions, will depend on easy, open, and continuous data exchange between the growing number of diabetes devices. SIPs have a key role in modernizing diabetes care for a large population of people living with diabetes.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted profound changes in Higher Education. Thus, policymakers in different national contexts worldwide needed to design alternative responses to deal with new educational scenarios. In Spain, rethinking educational management in Higher Education remains an issue of current debate. Methodological readjustments towards virtual teaching, the digital divide due to socio-economic and cultural issues of the students, unequal access to education, or a decrease in internationalization have been some of the most significant adversities faced during this time. Amid this crisis, the measures taken by political leaders and university managers played an essential role. This study aims to provide an overview of the policy measures developed during this period, describing some of the most important decisions taken by different universities in Spain. To this end, an exploration based on secondary data from extensive literature reviews is carried out to construct a descriptive analysis of the measures implemented in Spanish universities. The findings highlight the coordinated action of the Spanish university system and the staunch defense of face-to-face teaching. This health crisis has also highlighted the deficits of this level of education and shed light on its future. Spain faces major challenges in the field of higher education. Consequently, the Spanish university system must begin building the foundations for educational innovation and training education professionals without fear of online scenarios. Finally, this article also proposes suggestions to guide policymakers in dealing with future adverse situations.}

So far, educational approaches to health literacy have mainly been implemented in health sciences education and linked to the needs of health professionals in communication with patients. The main objective of this systematic scoping review was to investigate health literacy educational approaches in higher education study programs, including the covered content and the learning activities employed. Altogether, 26 studies on health literacy training in higher education study programs were included. The most frequent study programs represented were medicine and pharmacy. A wide range of health literacy content was extracted from the studies; by far the most frequently studied skill was patient communication, which was identified in 20 studies, followed by identification of patients with low literacy in 12 studies and conceptual knowledge of health literacy in 11 studies. All studies except one reported the use of student active learning as part of the educational approach, and 17 studies reported the use of educational technology. The scientific literature indicates that current health literacy educational approaches mainly focus on the individual components of health literacy and fail to address environmental components and health literacy in vulnerable population groups. Despite the rather extensive use of active learning in educational approaches, pedagogical foundations were scarcely reported. In addition, the use of educational technology was rarely pedagogically integrated.}

(1) Financial development can significantly promote the expansion of higher education. (2) The expansion of higher education can improve energy and environment-based technological progress. (3) Financial development can both directly and indirectly promote green technology evolution by expanding higher education. The joint financial development and higher education expansion can significantly empower green technology innovation. (4) In the process of promoting green technology innovation, financial development has a non-linear influence on it, with higher education as the threshold. The effect of financial development on green technology innovation varies according to the degree of higher education. Based on these findings, we put forward policy proposals for green technology innovation to promote economic transformation and development in China.}

The effects on organizations have been drastic and such tough times have demanded new organizational solutions as well as strong and new forms of organizational leadership. Leadership scholars have accelerated their research efforts in the quest to identify what is needed to lead in these uncertain times. In this paper, we adopt a bibliometric review to unravel the emerging trends in leadership research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in doing so, identify commonalities and divergences in these themes with respect to leadership approaches and assess potential avenues for future research. The findings reveal that research on the topic has emerged along six main clusters: (1) leadership and employee health during pandemic times, (2) public leadership, (3) leadership in health care, (4) leadership and diversity, (5) educational leadership, and (6) leadership and persuasive communication. The findings reveal that across these clusters, the pandemic has sparked research on leadership approaches that deal with change and uncertainty as well as those that are less hierarchical and person centered in nature. We also notice a novel attention to context. Rather than “new kids on the block,” these trends are largely continuations of established leadership theories and approaches that see their particular importance increase in this unprecedented situation. Finally, we outline some distinct avenues for further research with regard to leadership in COVID-19 times.}

Notwithstanding the magnitude of this evolution, the literature only partially captures the implications of value creation in the B2B digital context, leaving the contextual nature of value to remain vague and described mainly at an abstract level. This lack of a micro-foundation of value creation in context also makes its management exceedingly difficult. This study proposes a conceptual model that explains value creation in the digitally interconnected B2B business environment. Our analysis of 34 qualitative interviews with B2B managers showed the importance of a granular examination of value creation in context by identifying its dimensions and processes. At the same time, we showed the need to combine a micro theoretical focus with the transition to a more holistic and systemic view.}

abstract = {The manufacturing industry is poised to undergo a paradigm shift with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, popularly known as “Industry 4.0”, which will integrate the physical and digital worlds. As a widely acknowledged phrase among research institutions and universities, the “Industry 4.0” paradigm has attracted significant interest from the academic, business and scientific communities. Even though the concept is not new and has been at the forefront of scholarly research for many years with many interpretations, the “Industry 4.0” concept has just recently been introduced. It is widely accepted not only in the research field but also in the manufacturing ecosystems. However, there is a need to comprehend industry-specific research advancements, trends and gaps due to the diverse applications of different technologies. This article systematically reviews and comprehensively evaluates the research on different Industry 4.0 efforts and their applicability in the textile and manufacturing industries. This article aims to map the current Industry 4.0 literature in the textile and apparel industry to analyse and categorize existing research and identify research gaps. We utilized the PRISMA framework to conduct a systematic review of the literature and 34 research publications on Industry 4.0 in the textile and apparel industry were located using a well-organized keyword search of the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The findings indicate that, of all Industry 4.0 technologies, the internet of things (IoT) and RFID applications are the most extensively investigated in the textile and manufacturing industries. Despite the extensive applications of additive manufacturing (AM)/3D printing and augmented reality (AR), research in both fields is still in its infancy. The study revealed that Germany is the country that has published the most literature on Industry 4.0 projects in the textile and apparel industries. We urge that future academics focus on determining the relevance of Industry 4.0 initiatives to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as the textile and apparel industry is dominated by SMEs in many developing countries.}

Attitudes toward change and transformational leadership are regarded as important determinants of implementation success. This study tested a multilevel model of transformational leadership and leaders’ attitudes toward the innovation being implemented as predictors of staff attitudes and implementation success. Participants were 565 service providers (n = 478) and their supervisors (n = 87) working in mental health organizations currently implementing an evidence-based practice (EBP). Results provided support for positive relationships between transformational leadership and staff attitudes toward EBP, as well as staff attitudes toward EBP and implementation success. Moreover, results supported an indirect relationship between transformational leadership and implementation success through employees’ attitudes toward EBP. The results suggest that the leader’s behaviors are likely more critical to innovation implementation than the leader’s attitudes.}

From a communicative perspective, what is interesting about this series of events is not only the digital platforms and affordances that enabled it, but also the reckless behavior of WSB members and the ways in which this behavior was communicated—and continues to be celebrated and facilitated by the online trading community. Members share “loss porn,” praise each other for having “diamond hands” when holding on to investments that are losing value, and celebrate the principle of YOLO (you only live once). We conceptualize WSB as a YOLO public, an online community that is loosely and temporarily formed through the common action of seizing the opportunity to wreak havoc around power. Furthermore, we understand the events of the GameStop rescue as a controversial encounter that, we argue, offers hope for digitally mediated publics to develop in dynamic relations of difference rather than as stabilized oppositions.}

This article is about the need for the Greek economy to revisit its export growth strategies with regard to the agri-food sector, by assessing the factors affecting the performance of the EU Mediterranean agri-food exporter countries, such as France, Italy and Spain, including Greece. The applied gravity model methodology and both OLS and PPML estimations were conducted by use of UNCTADStat data between 1995 and 2019. The findings suggest that improving the availability of Greek agri-food products for exports constitutes a prerequisite for the competitiveness of this sector in international markets, which can be achieved by strengthening synergies between agribusinesses and by facilitating product standardization procedures.}

Methods: We searched several databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science) up to June 2018. We included studies investigating the effectiveness of MO teamwork in reducing CLABSI and CRBSI. The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. We used validated appraisal checklists to assess quality. Results: Seven studies were included: only one was a non-randomized case-controlled trial (CCT). All the others had a pre-post intervention design, one a time-series design and one an interrupted time-series design. The methodological heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Despite the low certainty of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, three studies including thousands of participants provided numerical data for calculating risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing MO with no intervention for decreasing the CLABSI rate in neonatal and pediatric ICUs. The one CCT disclosed no significant difference in the CLABSI rate decrease between groups (RR = 0.96; 95%CI 0.47–1.97). Nor did the pre- and post-intervention interrupted time-series design disclose a significant decrease (RR = 0.80; 95%CI 0.36 1.77). In the study using a before-after study design, the GRADE system found that the CLABSI rate decrease differed significantly in favor of post-intervention (RR = 0.13; 95%CI 0.03 0.57; p = 0.007). Conclusions: Despite the decreased CLABSI rate, the available evidence is low in quality. To reduce the unduly high CLABSI rates in neonatal and pediatric intensive care settings, custom-designed clinical trials should further define the clinical efficacy of MO to include it in care bundles as a new international standard.}

Based on a field study at an AI company, this article studies how AI is performed as developers enact two predictive systems along with stakeholders in public sector accounting and public sector healthcare. Inspired by STS theories about values in design, we analyze our empirical data focusing especially on how objectives, structured performances, and divisions of labor are built into the two systems and at whose expense. Our findings reveal that the development of the two AI systems is informed by politically motivated managerial interests in cost-efficiency. This results in AI systems that are (1) designed as managerial tools meant to enable efficiency improvements and cost reductions, and (2) enforced on professionals on the “shop floor” in a top-down manner. Based on our findings and a discussion drawing on literature on the original visions of human-centered systems design from the 1960s, we argue that turning AI into IA seems dubious, and ask what human-centered AI really means and whether it remains an ideal not easily realizable in practice. More work should be done to rethink human-machine relationships in the age of big data and AI, in this way making the call for ethical and responsible AI more genuine and trustworthy.}

The results indicate that relative advantage, top management support, cost-effectiveness, competitive pressure, vendor support, compatibility, AI strategic alignment and availability of resources, positively influence the intention to adopt AI-based technologies. The analysis demonstrated that the influence of market uncertainty on adoption intentions is insignificant. It was found that government regulation and complexity negatively influence adoption intentions.

Standard Bank Group’s IT costs were far above industry benchmarks, delivery was slow, staff was unhappy and there were a couple of large signature projects that were over time and budget by orders of magnitudes. Her predecessor has embarked on a large whole scale outsourcing journey and a decision needs to be made if that will continue. Dawie Olivier, her Head of Build, advocates something different: Agile and DevOps. The dream in this approach is to have many small cross-functional two-pizza teams that work together in close proximity and build software. The code created on a developer’s laptop will then seamlessly deploy to production automatically without the interference of pesky change control boards or some manual intervention. Should she continue with outsourcing or insource and focus on Agile? What she didn’t realise was that her successors will all face a similar situation and that answers will not be ready at hand. Many organisations face a similar dilemma of balancing outsourcing, Agile, DevOps and general constraints around skilled resources. We provide a rich narrative of the choices CIOs face in developing countries around these themes to help students understand the risks and opportunities these different approaches bring.}

This article focuses on the structural changes in agricultural technology in terms of patent applications by specific technology sector between the two periods: Period 1 (2000–2007) and Period 2 (2008–2015). Accordingly, we performed centrality analysis to measure the importance of each agricultural technology based on International Patent Classification (IPC) sub-classes. We also conducted citation analysis to identify whether the proportion of backward and forward citations of agricultural patents had significantly changed between the two periods. The results of the centrality analysis suggest that, whereas food technology was the most important technology sector in agriculture during both the periods, agricultural production technology experienced a considerable increase in its share in agriculture in Period 2. The results of the citation analysis confirm a substantial degree of interconnectivity between agricultural technology and non-agricultural technologies.}

This framework allows us to distinguish between hegemonic, populist, and popular-oriented flows of communication, as well as register changes in the interplay of different publics driven by digital media platforms. Digital transformations of the public sphere give rise to antagonistic and networked-individualistic flows of populist communication that put public hegemony under constant pressure. The challenge is to find ways to strengthen popular communications that enable democratic learning processes and the flourishing of communicative competences of all citizens.}

Cities present a microcosm for advancing a systemic understanding of people’s careers over time and in relation to broader issues. We acknowledge cities’ multilayered contexts by identifying six spheres—locality and networks, material infrastructure, economic activities, non-work, virtual reconfiguration, and nexus of social change. The interplay between careers and these city spheres informs intertwined phenomena such as well-being, mobility, and migration. To guide further research, our framework distinguishes two meta-theoretical perspectives. An entity perspective examines causal relationships across levels, analyzing how urban characteristics explain career-related phenomena, and vice versa. A constructionist perspective examines how people’s construal of careers in cities draws on cultural repertoires about work, non-work life, and the city, including its social, symbolic, and material aspects. We use the framework to discuss contributions of the five articles of this special issue. A career lens can contribute to our understanding of cities being sources of both stability and change. With cities currently facing significant disruptions, there has never been a more appropriate time for careers researchers to incorporate the city as context.}

This research aims to investigate the efficacy of integrating a puzzle-based game, with scaffolding strategies, to enhance students’ understanding and appreciation of cultural heritage content. In the activity, students are tasked with reconstructing art patterns from cultural heritage artifacts, a process which is designed to bolster their performance in recognizing and appreciating such patterns. A control group, utilizing a non-interactive instructional video with the same content, was also established to contrast and evaluate the benefits of the game-based approach. The evaluation of knowledge acquisition and transfer was conducted through pattern tests, with the participants’ eye movements recorded during the testing process. The results show that the participants in the game group exhibited significant advantages in terms of efficiently recognizing fundamental content and effectively transferring pattern recognition. Furthermore, the examination of the visual behavior within the game reveals that the integration of the jigsaw puzzle (game mechanic) and scaffolding (instructional strategy) can enhance the efficacy and cognitive strategies employed by participants in comprehending heritage content. This study develops design methodologies for cultural heritage games that enhances learning and appreciation.}

abstract = {The rise of right-wing populists in Western Europe has often been linked to their ability to exploit social media affordances to fuel anger. While scholarship has already examined the emotional dimension of the populist right’s online communication, with some researchers studying specifically the fuelling of anger among social media users, we still lack empirical proof of the mobilizational effectiveness of what we describe as “anger-triggering communication.” To explore this question, in this article, we develop a statistical and topic analysis of right-wing populists’ Facebook pages in Italy, France, Spain, and Germany during the 2019 European Union (EU) election campaign. We find that (a) right-wing populists on Facebook have a significantly higher number of “Angry” Facebook reactions per post compared to their political adversaries; (b) there is a positive and significant effect of the number of Angry reactions on the number of times a post is shared; (c) Angry reactions and Shares are overrepresented in posts on immigration and security, but anger-fuelled mobilization is not limited to these topics. These findings contribute to the scholarship on social media, emotional communication, and populism, adding insights on the mobilizational effectiveness of negative campaigning. The article highlights that stoking public anger, especially around controversial issues such as immigration and security, is a rewarding tactic because it increases motivational strength, and contributes to triggering high-threshold interactions such as sharing, which, in turn, are key for achieving virality in the diffusion of political messages.}

When the COVID-19 pandemic impeded street protests in spring 2020, SMOs had to adapt their strategies to online-only formats. We analyze the German-language Twitter communication of the climate movement Fridays for Future (FFF) before and during the lockdown to explain how SMOs adapted their strategy under online-only conditions. We collected (re-)tweets containing the hashtag #fridaysforfuture (N = 46,881 tweets, N = 225,562 retweets) and analyzed Twitter activity, use of hashtags, and predominant topics. Results show that although the number of tweets was already steadily declining before, it sharply dropped during the lockdown. Moreover, the use of hashtags changed substantially and tweets focused increasingly on thematic discourses and debates around the legitimacy of FFF, while tweets about protests and calls for mobilization decreased.}

This article aims to present the value discipline intersections as a resource to establish a competitive advantage in the digital era. With the rise in digital technologies, on the one hand, traditional firms that have gained a competitive advantage so far might not stand a chance before a digitally native firm that leverages multiple value disciplines simultaneously. On the other hand, digitally native firms, by not explicating the intersections between the value disciplines, do not reap a full harvest of their investments in digitalization. We present operational innovators, co-creators, efficient customer champions and bull’s eye to unfold the value discipline intersections, relevant to the digital age. We illustrate our idea through industry examples and conclude with implications for theory and practice.}

Although scholars have expressed an interest in studying RBSOs, nobody has incorporated the three different perspectives into a single integrated model. Therefore, the present article aims to develop a holistic theoretical framework, studying the human, financial, technological and social resources of an RBSO and highlighting whether the EO influences an RBSO during its generation and development phases. A case study from the information and communication technology sector was selected, and data were collected through a structured questionnaire complemented with in-depth and on-site interviews. The holistic framework adopted allowed to highlight the peculiarities of the RBSO: the marked vocation for scientific research, the EO of the founding team and the important role of the parent organization, mostly in supplying intangible assets. The emerged evidence shows how it is possible to generate and develop a successful RBSO, providing useful insights from both academic and managerial viewpoints.}

Within the last few years, our cars have also been transformed into computers on wheels. However, the apps with which we are accustomed are often not available in cars. Why are cars different? This teaching case examines how the worldwide automotive manufacturer BMW developed its onboard infotainment system into a digital platform. While the transformation of a manufacturing firm into a technology company reveals multiple challenges, new actors enter the stage. In 2017, Google announced the launch of Android Automotive OS, a complete operating system for cars with access to a vibrant platform ecosystem. Should BMW accept Google’s offer to use Android Automotive OS as a digital platform for their cars, or should they strive to create their own proprietary platform ecosystem? This teaching case introduces the dynamics of digital platform ecosystems and illustrates the “platform conundrum” that many traditional companies must confront: Is it better to build a new proprietary platform ecosystem or join an existing dominant platform ecosystem? We provide rich insights from BMW’s development, sales, and strategic divisions, helping students to understand the risks, chances, and challenges of various choices that occur in the context of digital platform ecosystems and why such decisions might be crucial to the future of traditional companies such as BMW.}

We also developed a theoretical and conceptual framework to define a metaverse in the workplace, which includes individual, team and organizational factors as well as contextual moderators that influence its implementation. Finally, we propose a definition of a metaverse in the workplace as a 3D virtual immersive environment where employees interact with each other using their avatar identities, perform work tasks, and have autonomy and opportunities for creativity. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on the practical applications of a metaverse in the workplace.

Empirical results imply that social credit system constructions exert a significant improvement effect on corporate environmental performance. In addition, corporate innovation, financial constraints alleviation, and the strengthening of environmental cases enforcement are three effective action mechanisms by which social credit system constructions helping improve corporate environmental performance.

abstract = {Digital work platforms are often said to view crowdworkers as replaceable cogs in the machine, favouring exit rather than voice as a means of resolving concerns. Based on a qualitative study of six German medium-sized platforms offering a range of standardized and creative tasks, we show that platforms provide voice mechanisms, albeit in varying degrees and levels. We find that all platforms in our sample enabled crowdworkers to communicate task-related issues to ensure crowdworker availability and quality output. Five platforms proactively consulted crowdworkers on task-related issues, and two on platform-wide organisation. Differences in the ways in which voice was implemented were driven by considerations about costs, control and a crowd’s social structure, as well as by platforms’ varying interest in fair work standards. We conclude that the platforms in our sample equip crowdworkers with “microphones” by letting them have a say on workflow improvements in a highly controlled and easily mutable setting, but do not provide “megaphones” for co-determining or even controlling platform decisions. By connecting the literature on employee voice with platform research, our study provides a nuanced picture of how voice is technologically and organisationally enabled and constrained in non-standard, digital work contexts.}

Institutions rely on factual data on the gender gap to evaluate their policies. However, the literature shows that the research and institutions should also analyze the impact of social beliefs on the success of these policies and initiatives. This study focuses on the impact of these perceptions in promoting female entrepreneurship. Data were collected from 287 responses to a questionnaire from Spanish women and men and were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. The results show that the perception of lack of equality increases the gender gap even if there are specific and effective policies in a society that attempt to eliminate the gender gap in terms of the role of women in the home or positions of power. The main result is that these perceptions ultimately affect women’s entrepreneurial intentions. The results have policy implications for companies and public institutions willing to change the gender narrative about entrepreneurship and design policies and initiatives that help women overcome cultural barriers and effectively promote female entrepreneurship.}

Undoubtedly, businesses will not be the same post the COVID-19 era, as it brings with itself both a threat and a cautious optimism as far as market offerings are concerned. Making a real difference to the landscape of experiences, therefore, requires a revisit. A “Needs-based, Action-oriented and Affiliation-centric” strategy mix is proposed to be the central plank of any survival design during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, based on the experience economy framework, we present a toolkit that the businesses can use as a blueprint for revival in the long term. The article suggests that the pandemic is here to teach the lesson of building experiences that are robust enough to survive the plunges in the market, personalized enough to retain loyalties, cohesive enough to not get diluted with a change in channel of offering and dramatic enough to keep the engagement alive at all times. Seen in this light, this article is first-of-its-kind attempt to chronicle the potency of the new experience economy measures in navigating through the COVID-19-induced business crisis and envisioning it as a framework pushing for a frugal approach.}

Workers and corporations scrambled to adjust their workstyles to a new normal, by avoiding the commute and working remotely from their homes or elsewhere. Japan is a country that stood out for its inability to adjust to the remote work environment. Comparative statistics show that Japan reported the lowest number of people engaged in remote work among the OECD countries, as well as the lowest percentage of corporations that offered remote work policies. In this article, I investigate why telework in Japan is difficult. The lack of telework in Japan may seem paradoxical, given the country’s reputation for being technologically advanced. I argue that it is not the technological infrastructure that is lacking in the Japanese workplace, but distinct features of work embedded in Japanese culture and its collectivist roots that prevent the effective implementation of telework. I rely on recently published data from various sources, and apply key sociological theories such as implicit contracts, gift exchange, dramaturgy, and impression management to substantiate my main arguments. The paper concludes by drawing on implications for the future of work in Japan.}

This article explores how TASS, as a state-owned news agency, has been able to retain its position as a domestic and international provider of news in competition with other state- and privately owned agencies in Russia. It uses a case-study approach, employing in-depth elite interviews together with existing research, news sources, professional databases and marketing reports. The particular focus is on management issues and on the technological challenges affecting TASS’ strategic actions and ongoing operations. We analyse (1) the historical development of TASS, (2) its role as a national and international agency, (3) its relations with the state and (4) its move to a B2C model. The article concludes that state financial support, combined with the strong managerial decisions taken by new executives, have restored TASS’ strong position in Russia’s highly competitive news market after the agency’s significant decline in the 1990s and early 2000s.}

This study addressed this research gap by looking at the effect of CSR communication through Facebook and news media coverage of CSR on corporate reputation in Switzerland. The results of this longitudinal study show that the salience and tone of news media coverage of CSR were positively related to corporate reputation, even though the news media coverage about CSR was predominantly negative. Thus, reputation was still strengthened even in the face of negative publicity. No effect of CSR communication through Facebook on corporate reputation was found.

abstract = {The mission of state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) has evolved, and their perception has shifted from focusing on constructing new assets to managing and maintaining existing transportation assets and optimizing asset performance. In response to this change, state DOTs began adopting a “transportation asset management” approach, an intensive data-driven decision-making process to maintain and extend the serviceability of transportation assets throughout their lifecycle. However, state DOTs continue to face challenges in conducting cross-asset system analysis and integrating data across systems throughout the asset lifecycle. Conversely, emerging technologies, namely Digital Twins, have the potential to leverage the value of asset data and transform data into valuable insights to inform decision-making. The definition of Digital Twins in the infrastructure industry is inconsistent, and the transition toward a digitized built environment—a preliminary step required for a successful implementation of Digital Twins—has not been investigated. Thus, this paper presents the burning platform for the need for Digital Twins and defines the concept. Additionally, this study investigates the current practices of state DOTs toward the digital transition of their transportation asset data and contextualizes the DOTs’ maturity in the advancement of digital processes. This paper focuses on ancillary asset systems, particularly Roadside, Electronic, and Drainage Asset systems. A web-based survey was developed and distributed to state DOTs for data collection. For each asset, the perceived timeline for digitization was investigated, and three variables related to data digitization were explored: data format, data level of detail, and data collection technique.}

abstract = {In times of crisis, journalism’s own history needs to be reflected upon, both from within and from outside the newsroom. This paper attempts both. From a scientific perspective, we examined the process of the digitalization of journalism and then asked journalists from different generations to reflect on this process. Based on data gathered from these semi-structured interviews with German journalists, our paper presents their evaluation on the evolution from analog to digital journalism—from retired male reporters who wrote most of their articles on typewriters to young female data journalists. The interviews with journalists—including local newspaper reporters, public broadcasting services and news magazines’ editors, freelancers and former German Democratic Republic (GDR) journalists—are part of a larger funded research project on German journalism. Their analysis reveals a common problematization of the growing pace of news production and the hybridization of media formats. The qualitative data confirm data from quantitative surveys on journalism and can help international journalism research to get an in-depth understanding on how journalists perceive the changes over the last decades in their trade.}

Through an in-depth examination of the dynamic forces that led CEO Meg Whitman to split HP, we propose that the company’s evolving business ecosystem led to the divergence of the consumer-oriented and enterprise-oriented business models in the corporate portfolio. We document the interplay between inter–business model complementarity and intra–business model complexity and how this vicious cycle, in combination with increasing capital market pressure, led to the CEO decision to split and her public justification for this momentous move. Our combined longitudinal interpretative and realist process-tracing approach generates one of the first conceptual frameworks to integrate insights from the ecosystem and corporate divestiture literatures.}

The analysis is based on balanced panel data covering the period 2004–2019. Internet-user statistics and Google Trends search data are used as a proxy for digital adoption and virtual proximity, respectively, by source markets. Results lend support to the notion that virtual proximity rather than digital adoption aided international travel, demonstrating that digitalization cannot be interpreted as a fluid and vague concept that exerts a consistent effect. Results also present evidence that Southern European countries should not be treated as a block of homogenous destinations. These findings inform stakeholders regarding the significance of digital platforms as strategic tools to empower consumers.}

This study aims to investigate the relationship between smart supply chains, smart technologies, and operational performance in the manufacturing industry. A survey questionnaire was conducted among registered manufacturing industries, and the results were analyzed using Smart PLS to test 10 hypotheses. Four hypotheses were supported out of 119 responses received through simple random sampling. The study suggests implementing instrumented supply chains using smart technologies can enhance operational performance. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, academics, and industry practitioners to improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. This research emphasizes the importance of smart supply chains and smart technologies in achieving operational excellence, and further studies are necessary to address the identified limitations and contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of smart technologies in the supply chain’s digitalization.}

The results show that governments can play the role not only of a financier and legislator but also of a direct participant in innovation by entering into partnerships with the other Triple Helix actors. In addition, this study revealed that, irrespective of which partners and needs are in question, these networks operate mostly with public funds.}

First, we show that average share of technocratic (as opposed to partisan) ministers in European cabinets rose from 9.5% to 14.2% over the last two decades. This increase is characteristic of all macro-regions, except Scandinavian countries. Second, technocratic ministers are assigned to a diversity of portfolios and not just finance and economy, which, respectively, account for only 15% of technocratic ministers. Finally, technocratic ministers do not hold office for shorter periods of time than partisan ones, except when they are part of caretaker cabinets.}

It first introduces three characteristics that socially construct the CCI crisis and its hegemonic practice of emergency resilience (time, disaster discourse, and the adaptation of aesthetic digitalization) and exposes multiple discourses – from the technologies of cultural statistics to corporate financial modelling – that construct an ideology of “resilience-as-deficit”. In contrast to this approach, the article develops three characteristics of ecological resilience: a focus on transition and the long term; resilience as a decentred strategy and networked resource; and aesthetic digitization as a radical praxis of adaptability. Examining arts impact and cultural policy reports, drawing on ecological, feminist and cultural resilience studies, and analysing a digital cultural event in Asia (the Singapore LGBT cultural festival, Pink Dot), the article argues that ecological resilience offers new capacities towards a cultural ecology that can nurture fair work, artistic innovation, economic growth and cultural vitality.}

Telepathology does not require a patient’s presence for intercommunication; therefore, it is essential to focus on the acceptance of the main occupational groups that are involved. This study aimed to assess the attitude and acceptance of telepathology in the pathology departments of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA) hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Method A cross-sectional survey was distributed among pathologists and laboratory technologists in the pathology departments of MNGHA hospitals (N = 78). The data collection instrument was built upon the technology acceptance model’s (TAM’s) constructs of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), attitude (ATT), and intention to use (ITU). Results In total, 64 questionnaires were completed (response rate of 82%). The acceptance levels represented by the median responses to the TAM constructs, varied from 5.5 (slightly agree) to 6 (agree). The availability of digital pathology services in the workplace was significantly correlated with the participants’ acceptance of telepathology. There was a strong correlation between ITU and PU and a moderate correlation between PEU and PU. Conclusion Results suggest that telepathology is more likely to be adopted if it is considered helpful, therefore, it is recommended to focus on its usefulness and direct benefits during the training period. The participants who were familiar with the concept of digital pathology were more receptive to using telepathology, which might emphasize the importance of introducing and familiarizing the resident with digital health during their training period.}

As local markets crumble and unemployment rises, online freelance work offers a seemingly accessible source of income that is independent of the constraints of local markets and national regulations. This article scrutinizes this promise against the backdrop of multiple evolving crises in Lebanon, asking to what extent a transnational digital economy can serve crisis-affected populations, including refugees, as a secure source of income and work. The research is based on interviews and surveys with Syrian refugees and host community members in Lebanon, who participated in digital skills training programmes and worked as digital freelancers for Social Impact Platforms and Enterprises. Their experience shows how the impact of Lebanon’s crises undermined the feasibility of web-based digital work precisely at a time when they needed it most. Syrian refugees in Lebanon are affected by particular layers of regulatory restriction, including their exclusion from digital platforms, skills training programmes, and the financial system. As these layers of exclusion intersect with the precarity of self-employed digital jobs and a severe economic crisis, Syrians’ displacement in Lebanon is reconfigured into a digital space of exile within a transnational digital economy. Viewed from this perspective, the digital economy fails to live up to its inclusive promise and fails to transcend the restrictive regulations, economic instability, and precarity that characterizes crisis-affected states and populations.}

India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have emerged as fastest growing e-commerce and digital markets. Studies show that digital connectivity and e-commerce will help SMEs and marginalised groups in the two economies to diversify their client base at lower costs, while consumers will have access to a wide range of products. To support digitalisation and e-commerce, several initiatives have been taken by the governments in India and ASEAN. Many of them are related to enhancing cross-country trade and collaboration. The ASEAN–India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosperity 2016–2020 is one such initiative. However, SMEs so far have not gained much from such initiatives. This article provides an overview of the current status of digtalisation and e-commerce in India and ASEAN. It examines their comparative positions in terms of technology adaptation and policy regimes and then presents the participation of these countries in bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral agreements and forums. Apart from infrastructure issues, restrictive regulations like data localisation requirements and lack of standards along with the defensive position of countries in international forums is adversely impacting the ability of their SMEs to scale up. The article provides recommendations on use of technology to help SMEs to scale up through a joint innovative knowledge sharing and e-commerce platform.}

abstract = {Background The COVID-19 outbreak has left a destructive trail around the world in terms of deaths, travel restrictions, trade deficits, and an economy that is collapsing, including job losses, real estate, health benefit loss, and a decrease in the quality of access to care and services in almost all sectors, as well as generally in the overall quality of life. The successful development of COVID-19 vaccines may hasten the acceleration of global post-pandemic recovery by vaccinating residents, with a particular focus on important groups, in order to decrease secondary transmission. This will facilitate the easing of enforced restrictions on global and local travel, the tourism industry, education sectors, and other aspects of social life. Vaccinating residents may also help reduce the risk of secondary transmission. The efforts that Saudi Arabia made to control the epidemic were outstanding on all fronts and in all spheres, including the health, education, commerce, and tourism industries, among others. Objective The purpose of this research was to investigate the elements that influence a traveler’s decision to acquire and use a digital health passport (DHP), which was introduced by the Tawakkalna application in Saudi Arabia at the COVID-19 conference. Methods The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information system success model (ISSM) were the primary theoretical frameworks that guided this investigation. The terms “perceived ease of use” (PEOU), “perceived usefulness” (PU), “information quality” (IQ), “service quality” (SQ), and “net benefit” (NB) were applied in order to investigate the user’s acceptance and use of the DHP, as well as how it contributes to the facilitation of traveling and public perception toward using the DHP. Results In order to assess the validity of the proposed model and its four assumptions, a survey was sent through social media platforms to get responses from nationals and residents of Saudi Arabia. The SPSS program was used to evaluate a total of 103 replies that were considered valid. Following the completion of the study, the findings revealed that PEOU, PU, IQ, SQ, and NB all had favorable impacts on the use of DHP. Conclusion PEOU, PU, IQ, and SQ have a significant relationship with NB that affects the public’s acceptance and use of DHP. This study has established validity and reliability while testing the relationship between the variables suggested in the research model.}

The direct impacts of FOMO, consumer attitudes, and subjective norms on visit intentions were examined within a conceptual research model that combines the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and self-determination theory (SDT). Survey data obtained from 385 potential tourists were analyzed by PLS-SEM. Findings revealed that the desire for continuous learning positively influences FOMO, and involvement positively affects attitudes toward museum visits, which, in turn, increases visit intentions. Enjoyment from the VTE moderates the attitude–visit intentions relationship. This study has extended previous findings by proposing and empirically testing an original framework for examining behavioral intentions. It has shown the significant impact of the desire for continuous learning on FOMO, which operates as a self-regulatory feeling and increases museum visit intentions.}

abstract = {Extant research on the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying pays little attention to the role of perpetrator traits in influencing workplace cyberbullying, as well as the unique occurrence context that distinguishes workplace cyberbullying with juvenile cyberbullying, workplace bullying, and adult cyberbullying in general. To fill these gaps, we consider the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying under the theoretical lens of the general theory of crime and routine activities theory. We build a model incorporating low self-control, a widely discussed perpetrator trait in criminology theories, with three types of routine activities representing the unique occurrence context for workplace cyberbullying—mWork, boundary-spanning in enterprise social media, and proactive email checking. We tested our model with 2025 employees in the United States. Our findings demonstrate that low self-control and the three routine activities are strong motivators for workplace cyberbullying. Our findings further show that the effect of low self-control on workplace cyberbullying is amplified by the three routine activities. The study contributes to our understanding of why workplace cyberbullying occurs and offers potential implications for managers interested in reducing incidences of workplace cyberbullying in their organization.}

abstract = {Social media platforms are now serving the dual purpose of social interaction as well as commercial transactions. It is an extension of e-commerce on social media, leveraging social support for shopping purposes. This study has taken selected community-related factors and vendors-related factors to investigate their impact on purchase intention from Instagram store. Acknowledging that social commerce possesses a different environment than that of e-commerce, we have also tested the mediating role of trust in determining consumer purchase intention from an Instagram store. The present study used the Stimulus–Organism–Response model along with trust transference theory and psychological reactance theory to propose a theoretical framework to understand purchase intention with regard to the Instagram store. This study has tested the impact of physical shopping constraint on purchase intention which had previously not been tested empirically with regard to social commerce. Taking empirical data from 304 Instagram users, the study revealed community factors to have a more significant impact than vendors attributes. The findings of the study advance our understanding of how purchase intention is formed on Instagram store and highlight the importance of trust in this mechanism.}

abstract = {This article adopts an interpretive approach to investigate how local policy-makers portray and justify their own visions of digital governance initiatives at the municipal level. Our investigation focuses on smart city projects submitted by various Belgian municipalities in the framework of the “Intelligent Territory” call for proposals initiated in 2019 by the Walloon Region. We use Boltanski and Thévenot’s theory of orders of worth and combine quantitative and qualitative content analysis to categorize the different justifications elaborated by municipal governments. The empirical results point to the polysemic nature of the smart city concept and highlight the diversity of opportunities offered by smart city policies according to municipal policy-makers. Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of the varieties of interpretations underpinning the construction of digital governance initiatives. It therefore supports the argument according to which there is no one-size-fits-all approach to smart city policies as local policy-makers may attribute different meanings to them and may formulate place-based ICTs solutions to what they perceive as the most pressing problems of their territories. Points for practitioners Smart city projects can be used by governing authorities as instruments to achieve a variety of policy goals Examples of policy goals are to boost local economic development, to improve the effectiveness of municipal service provision, to strengthen social bonds across local community members, to promote the ecological preservation of urban environments and to improve the collaboration between citizens and public administrations Local governments can adaptively use smart technologies as instruments to overcome multiple place-based environmental, social and economic problems Local governments should frame smart urban technologies as means to solve different societal problems and achieve different policy goals – rather than an end per se}

In this study, we systematically evaluate China’s digital economy based on regional data experience and construct a nonlinear dynamic threshold model to incorporate a heterogeneous threshold of green technology innovation into the influential mechanism to figure out whether the digital economy can effectively reduce regional carbon emissions. According to the results, China’s digital economy currently shows a trend of overall upward and local fluctuation and there is a large “gap” between the rich and poor. Interestingly, green technology innovation has a heterogeneous threshold effect between the digital economy and carbon emissions: a lesser level of green technology innovation promotes the carbon emission impact of the digital economy to a certain extent, but when green technology innovation rises and exceeds a threshold, the digital economy can dramatically inhibit regional carbon emissions. This study answers the question of how to use the threshold effect of green technology innovation to reduce carbon emissions in the digital economy, which has significant theoretical and practical value to reduce carbon emissions in developing countries.}

Nevertheless, the Internet has proliferated unequally across the world, resulting in global digital inequalities. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the dependence on online education to prevent the interruption of academic progress in schools and universities worldwide. The global pandemic further worsened the situation for Pakistan, which is neither economically strong nor is the country’s ICT infrastructure well-established to facilitate the successful accomplishment of virtual courses and classes. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the level of Internet access among the Pakistani universities’ teachers and students, and their ICT skills as they applied to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study used the qualitative method of email interviews and thematic analysis to present the study’s results. This study revealed that most Pakistani students, especially those from rural and remote areas, experienced challenges because they neither had proper Internet access, nor could they use laptops and virtual learning systems. Students, who belonged to the upper and middle classes of urban areas and enrolled in private-sector universities, were not as directly affected by Pakistan’s pervasive digital divide to carryout their education during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

We discovered that hierarchy steepness has a positive correlation with organizational coordination intensity but a negative correlation with an individual’s coordination power. A steeper hierarchy is beneficial for intraorganizational coordination so, averagely, an individual’s coordination power weakens in well-coordinated organizations. The findings refuted previous arguments that took hierarchy as an obstacle to coordination and proved the functionality of a steeper hierarchy. They suggest PBOs steepen the hierarchical structure to improve intraorganizational coordination.}

To address this gap, 51 Tony Elumelu Foundation participants’ narratives are focused on to draw on an Africapitalism framework highlighting chasms within and between western neoliberalism frameworks and philanthrocapitalism’s marketisation. By framing this paper using philanthrocapitalism discourse, the authors critically examined the activities of African philanthropists and the effects of their neoliberal adoption on recipients. Semi-structured interview analysis produced three key ideologies demonstrating “what”, “how” and “why” philanthrocapitalism is marketised, namely, utopianism and the illusion of a better socioeconomic tomorrow; neoliberalism and a culture of dominance; social investment and marketisation of benevolence. These thematic paradoxes were used to create an additional four-aspect Africapitalism framework contributing to “what”, “how” and “why” philanthrocapitalism is marketised in Africa, its impacts, challenges and solutions. Contributions, limitations and implications for research are articulated.}

Based on an interview study with representatives of private, public and intermediary organisations, the study identified three different types of improvisational handling as responses to the pandemic crisis involving “scaling up” and “scaling down” critical work practices. By “scaling up” and “scaling down”, we refer to practices for which, due to the pandemic, it has been imperative to urgently scale up an existing operational process or develop a new process, and alternatively extensively scale down or cease an existing process. The types of improvisational handling differed depending on the discretion of involved actors in terms of the extent to which the tasks, methods and/or results were given beforehand. These types of improvisational handling resulted in temporary solutions that may become permanent after the pandemic. The framework and model proposed in the article can be used as a tool to analyse and learn from the changes in work practices that have been set in motion during the pandemic. Such learning may improve the ability to cope with future extensive crises and other rapid change situations.}

In this study, we perform a large-scale analysis of the Swedish newspaper market, surveying 130 newspapers and parliamentary speeches over a period of six years (2014–2019), to substantiate to what extent market and for-profit ownership forms impact political viewpoint diversity. Our analysis shows that newspapers with market leadership and chain ownership offer more political viewpoint diversity than number two and single-owned papers. In contrast, the ownership forms surveyed here (private, foundation, and publicly traded ownerships) display little effect on newspapers’ internal diversity. We also find that a greater number of papers in a local market does not imply more external diversity in that market. The analysis thus offers some nuance to the notion that ownership form and market pluralism are prerequisites for viewpoint diversity, highlighting instead the importance of scale effects for pluralistic media systems.}

Therefore, we aim to create and assess an extended value-beliefs-norms theory with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, trust in artificial intelligence (AI), and the benefits of AI, in comparing three types of space tourism (Earth, suborbital, and orbital). To achieve the goals, multi-method analyses of 1,000 respondents were applied, including partial least squares-structural equation modeling, multi-group analysis, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, and deep learning. Results revealed that the extended value-belief-norm model well explains space tourist behavior, ESG also has significant roles on the research model, and the three types have unique characteristics.}

The article shows that in France, the central government reacted determinedly and hierarchically, with tough containment measures. By contrast, the response in Germany was characterized by an initial bottom-up approach that gave way to remarkable federal unity in the further course of the crisis, followed again by a return to regional variance and local discretion. In Sweden, there was a continuation of “normal governance” and a strategy of relying on voluntary compliance largely based on recommendations and less – as in Germany and France – on a strategy of imposing legally binding regulations. The comparative analysis also reveals that relevant stakeholders in all three countries have used the crisis as an opportunity for changes in the institutional settings and administrative procedures. Points for practitioners COVID-19 has shown that national political and administrative standard operating procedures in preparation for crises are, at best, partially helpful. Notwithstanding the fact that dealing with the unpredictable is a necessary part of crisis management, a need to further improve the institutional preparedness for pandemic crises in all three countries examined here has also become clear. This should be done particularly by way of shifting resources to the health and care sectors, strengthening the decentralized management of health emergencies, stocking and/or self-producing protection material, assessing the effects of crisis measures, and opening the scientific discourse to broader arenas of experts.}

While hubs are usually associated with an urban environment, this case study deals with the development of a rural digital hub over several years in a small town in East Groningen (NL). In the context of an Interreg project, observations during project meetings, in-depth interviews and document analysis were conducted to closely monitor the hub’s development process. Initially, the hub initiators aimed at stimulating business activities and innovation linked to digital technologies. Thereby, an originally urban digital hub concept was copied into a rural context without a rural translation. Along the way, they were forced to adapt and scale down the scope of the project while at the same time, a broader target group had to be formulated. Moreover, the municipality lacked an overarching digital strategy, which compromised demand aggregation and supply synchronisation – two essential ingredients for rural digital hubs.}

However, while several strategies aimed at rationalising consumption can be observed in leading digital economy companies, instead of solving the consumption problem by increasing demand, they tend to exacerbate the structural weakness of consumption.

Based on the interviews and by interlinking the factors identified in literature to have a positive influence on entrepreneurial ecosystems, we introduce talent transformation as a potential key process for the flourishing of entrepreneurial ecosystems and find the social and contextual business environment to be the main independent co-factors. By investigating the European best-practice example of the Nordic countries, we develop and introduce a three-phased talent transformation process and make concrete recommendations for entrepreneurial ecosystem development that can be applied in any geographic context.}

abstract = {Firms increasingly recognize open innovation as a key aspect of their innovation strategies. This study of 200 open innovation managers showed that open internal communication by senior leaders drives higher legitimacy judgments, which in turn drives open innovation success. Further, legitimacy judgments mediate the relationship between open internal communication and open innovation success. Open external communication by senior leaders moderates the indirect relationship between open internal communication and open innovation success, with more open external communication strengthening the influence on open innovation success. These results suggest firm-level open communication by senior leaders is essential for project-level open innovation success.}

A cross-sectional survey was conducted to obtain data about patients’ demographic and medical information, technological familiarity as well as patients’ experience and opinions about TR. The 227 patients completing the survey reported a mean ± SD age of 40.7 ± 13.9 years and musculoskeletal disorders as the most common condition treated by TR. The majority of patients expressed satisfaction and confidence with their therapists’ ability to assess and treat their problems using TR. Approximately 75.3% of participants stated that therapists demonstrated a strong understanding of their health conditions, while 82% reported that TR entailed a convenient service during COVID-19. The study found associations between age and patient’s ability and confidence to use technology as well as a relationship between the type of treatment received and participants’ overall opinions. Patients demonstrated acceptance, confidence, and satisfaction with TR during COVID-19. Patient age and treatment type fulfill a major role in patients’ perceptions of TR.}

This theorization suggests project managers avoid the tragedy of the project by crafting effective self-governance structures in the face of pluralism.

abstract = {Carbon neutrality is an important policy in the current global response to climate change and has been widely recognized by various industries. In the process of promoting carbon neutrality, new energy plays a pivotal role. In this study, the definition and connotation of new energy and its role and specific operation in the energy transition of carbon neutrality are firstly explained. Promoting new energy development requires significant green and low-carbon investments. Taking China as an example, this paper analyzes the opportunities brought by the carbon neutral process to the field of green finance and analyzes the main features and development trends of green finance in China at present. Then this paper proposes policy recommendations to strengthen the development of green finance in China in terms of improving the green financial policy system, enhancing the supply capacity of green financial services, and optimizing the supporting environment for green financial development. Finally, this paper analyzes the measures and experiences of the United States in promoting low-carbon development and proposes countermeasures for China’s low-carbon development on the basis of the five major relationships that need attention in China’s carbon-neutral process. That is, strengthen the top-level design and improve the regulatory policy system; optimize the energy structure and increase the proportion of clean energy; optimize the industrial structure and reduce energy consumption in key industries; build a complete low-carbon technology system and promote low-carbon technology research and development and demonstration applications, and encourage local conditions to explore low-carbon development paths. The development of green finance can contribute to the advancement of new energy technologies, thus contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals.}

Collecting empirical data from the German energy industry and using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we explore how five major network attributes (size, diversity, strength, innovativeness, and complementarity) combine to impact firm-level innovation. Based on the empirical results, we specify the orchestrating themes that constitute the “internal” and “external” fit of network configurations. Concerning internal fit, we identify a distinct pattern of complementing and substituting relations between network attributes. Specifically, we find that innovation performance results from the firm’s network combining network size or partner diversity or tie strength, and partner innovativeness or partner complementarity. Concerning external fit, we demonstrate that depending on firm size and internal intellectual capital, there are different “optimal” network configurations for different types of firms.}

abstract = {Background The evolutionary stages of manufacturing have led us to conceptualize the use of Industry 4.0 for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), powered by Industry 4.0 technologies. Using applications of integrated process optimizations reliant on digitized data, we propose novel intelligent networks along the vaccine value chain. Vaccine 4.0 may enable maintenance processes, streamline logistics, and enable optimal production of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine 4.0 Framework The challenge in applying Vaccine 4.0 includes the requirement of large-scale technologies for digitally transforming manufacturing, producing, rolling-out, and distributing vaccines. With our framework, Vaccine 4.0 analytics will target process performance, process development, process stability, compliance, quality assessment, and optimized maintenance. The benefits of digitization during and post the COVID-19 pandemic include first, the continual assurance of process control, and second, the efficacy of big-data analytics in streamlining set parameter limits. Digitization including big data-analytics may potentially improve the quality of large-scale vaccine production, profitability, and manufacturing processes. The path to Vaccine 4.0 will enhance vaccine quality, improve efficacy, and compliance with data-regulated requirements. Discussion Fiscal and logistical barriers are prevalent across resource-limited countries worldwide. The Vaccine 4.0 framework accounts for expected barriers of manufacturing and equitably distributing COVID-19 vaccines. With amalgamating big data analytics and biometrics, we enable the identification of vulnerable populations who are at higher risk of disease transmission. Artificial intelligence powered sensors and robotics support thermostable vaccine distribution in limited capacity regions, globally. Biosensors isolate COVID-19 vaccinations with low or limited efficacy. Finally, Vaccine 4.0 blockchain systems address low- and middle-income countries with limited distribution capacities. Conclusion Vaccine 4.0 is a viable framework to optimize manufacturing of vaccines during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.}

However, from the literature study of tourism culture, it is found that there is still a gap between the remolding of tourism culture and the development of tourism enterprises in the digital era. This study aims to identify the enterprise clustering effect and employment benefit of rural tourism culture reshaping. By empirical research, this study establishes a new conceptual research framework for rural tourism sustainability to cover the gap between the cultural reshaping and enterprise development for rural tourism in Zhejiang. We began with investigation to villagers on their acceptance of reshaped tourism culture. Through interviews with entrepreneurs, this study investigates the relationship between tourism cultural reshaping and tourism enterprise image. An enterprise network of regional tourism cultural IP image has been established to describe the density among the whole tourism cultural industry. The location entropy index is adopted to show the employment in tourism enterprises. This index reflects residents’ acceptance of the reshaped cultural image as a key influencing factor of enterprises’ sustainable development. Furthermore, it is found that tourism cultural reshaping is a significant base for rural tourism industry clustering. The research results suggest that tourism corporation can contribute to the local tourism economy by reshaping culture.}

We conduct an empirical investigation of Last.fm, an online music discovery platform, with a view to unpacking the work of data and algorithms in the process of categorization. Drawing on Eleanor Rosch and her colleagues, we link the making of categories with the construction of basic objects that function as key filters or registers for perceiving and organizing the world and interacting with it. In contexts such as the ones we have studied, basic objects are made out of data rather than expert or community-based knowledge. In such settings, basic objects work as pervasive reality filters and as the entities on which other organizational objects and categories are built. As they diffuse, such objects and the categories they instantiate become naturalized, increasingly reconfiguring the social order of organizations and their environments as a data order. Once key organizational activities such as the making of objects and categorizing are rearranged by data and algorithms, organizations can no longer be framed as separate from the technologies they deploy.}

A concurrent mixed-methods research design used soft systems methodology tools to inform data collection and analysis following interviews, observation, and e-surveys with stakeholders. Findings showed that the parents adopted aspects of the telehealth intervention (urinalysis) but were less engaged with the voiding diary and weighing. The parents gained confidence in decision-making and identified that the intervention reduced delays in their child receiving appropriate treatment, decreased the time burden, and improved engagement with general practitioners. Managing the additional workload was a challenge for the clinical team. Parental empowerment and self-efficacy were clear outcomes from the intervention. Parents exercised their confidence and control and were selective about which aspects of the intervention they perceived as having credibility and which they valued.}

However, the existing literature on the impact of ICT on carbon efficiency is relatively shallow. Using a database of Chinese cities, this study empirically explores the role of ICT in carbon efficiency from the aspects of direct impact, mediation effect, and threshold effect. Results show that ICT significantly improves the carbon efficiency represented by single-factor and total-factor carbon efficiency. The mediation effect indicates that technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and external openness are effective ways for ICT to play its role. The threshold model shows that the promoting effect between the two depends on the local institutional environment. Further heterogeneity analysis shows that ICT plays a more remarkable role in promoting carbon efficiency in eastern regions. This study provides evidence for aggressively digitizing economies to shift towards a low-carbon economy. Policymakers are encouraged to consider better integrating ICTs into sustainable development strategies.}

However, technological innovations (TI) and remittances, among the financial system’s essential components, are relatively ignored. In addition, nations’ economic progress and environmental performance also depend upon the nature of their economic structure. This empirical research investigates the effects of TI, remittances and economic complexity (EC) on CO2 controlling economic growth and trade openness (TR) in the selected 15 Asian nations. The study collected panel data of 15 Asian countries from 1990 to 2019 and employed the panel quantile regression and augmented mean group methods to unveil the impacts of variables on CO2 emissions. The empirical findings established that remittances are negatively linked with CO2 emissions. Similarly, EC reduces CO2 emissions in the context of Asian countries. In addition, EC and remittances Granger cause CO2 emissions. These findings indicate that remittances and EC positively contribute to environmental quality in Asian countries. Conversely, TI, economic growth, and TR intensify CO2 emissions in Asian countries. Finally, the study recommended policies to enhance remittances and EC in Asian countries to curb environmental degradation.}

Methods A rapid review protocol was developed in accordance with Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Guidance. Medline, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were developed using population, intervention, comparator, outcome, study design, and timeframe components. Two reviewers searched, screened, and extracted data. AMSTAR was used for critical appraisal. Results were synthesised narratively. Results Searches yielded 18 studies out of 881 for inclusion. Findings were identified across seven domains: acceptability and accessibility; therapeutic relationships; flexibility offered by telehealth; participation and engagement; confidentiality and privacy; equipment and technical considerations; and training and support. Conclusion Telehealth provides unique opportunities to improve access to early years health services for young mothers. However, considerable accessibility barriers remain in the form of connectivity issues, access to appropriate technology, and the acceptability of remote healthcare delivery.

abstract = {The future of the academic book has been under debate for many years now, with academic institutional dynamics boosting output, while actual demand has moved in the opposite direction, leading to a reduced market which has felt like it is in crisis for some time. While journals have experienced widespread migration to digital, scholarly monographs in print form have been resilient and digital alternatives have faced significant problems of acceptance, particularly in the arts and humanities. Focusing in particular on the arts and humanities, this article asks how, and under what conditions, the digitally mediated long-form academic publication might hold a viable future. It examines digital disruption and innovation within humanities publishing, contrasts different models and outlines some of the key challenges facing scholarly publishing in the humanities. This article examines how non-traditional entities, such as digital humanities research projects, have performed digital publishing roles and reviews possible implications for scholarly book publishing’s relationship to the wider research process. It concludes by looking at how digital or hybrid long-form publications might become more firmly established within the scholarly publishing landscape.}

abstract = {Digital revolution is instrumental to the wave of globalisation and transformation of the global economy. But the pace of digital transformation and service trade is low in the West African region. This article investigates the effect of digital transformation on the development of service trade in the region. This research captured digitisation in two standpoints: internet penetration rate and mobile subscription rate. The Im-Pesaran-Shin unit-root test affirms that the model is appropriate for panel autoregressive distributed lag estimation method. Adopting pool mean group estimator, the results attest for the existence of cointegrations in the model. The estimations reveal that the effect of digitisation on service trade is a long-run phenomenon. While the result is robust with export, it is not consistent with import. The long-run positive impact of digitisation on service export ranges from 0.087% to 0.159%, depending on the proxy for digitisation. The overall short-run effect is not statistically significant in export and not robust in import. It is reportedly consistent in some countries but not robust with some others. The region needs to rally in adopting and adapting to the new face of technology to improve service trade. JEL Codes: C23, F14, O33}

This is specifically true in decentralized public administration, where the stakeholders need a modern technology that integrates them. This study examines the emerging challenges and prospects of digital transformation and the stakeholders’ integration in urban land administration in Mekelle City, Ethiopia. An interpretive paradigm, qualitative analytical method, and case study strategy were adopted for this study. A total of 78 interviewees comprising 30 auctioneers, 20 experts, 20 officials, 4 judges, and 4 prosecutors participated based on the data saturation principle. The study revealed that digitalized land administration offers opportunities to reduce civil servants’ workload, improve cost-effective service delivery, and enhance trust between the municipal government and its clients. However, the system of urban land administration in the city is not digitalized due to financial limitations and leadership challenges. Furthermore, this study revealed a low level of stakeholders’ integration in Mekelle due to the lack of proper implementation of e-government, e-service, and e-participation, including lack of commitment by the stakeholders. Thus, a non-digitalized land administration system, insufficient capacity, and weak monitoring and evaluation systems impeded the client’s pursuit of enhanced municipal government services.}

Against the COVID-19 context, this paper retells some of the existing debates for Vietnamese QA and accreditation activities, as well as identifies emerging challenges in QA practices in the post-pandemic era. Theoretically, the paper contributes a conceptual tool to examine the QA of the Vietnamese HE system, embracing three dimensions of teaching and learning, inputs and outputs. This further underpins our inquiry for QA practices in the Vietnamese HE context which has been scaffolded and developed accordingly. Drawn from a critical review and analysis of emerging policies and existing literature, practical implications and projections for the directions of Vietnamese QA in the future will be provided. This paper presents a timely insight for the process of policy-making and the implementation process of QA in Vietnamese HE during a time of uncertainties and looks towards building resilience to future crises.}

It argues that the accelerating process of the digitalization of public services during the pandemic should be understood in connection with the ongoing, broader transformation of the Turkish state into the neoliberal regulatory state that has been ideologically framed as a facilitator of market-led economic development. This argument is based on the “state transformation approach” developed as an alternative analytical tool to address governance outcomes as a manifestation of neoliberally informed shifts in the location of state power, in the groups of actors that exercise state power, and in the ideas used to rationalize the exercise of it.}

The SLR is based on peer-reviewed articles which were extracted from the Web of Science Database between 2015 and 2022. The VOSviewer software helped the authors in identifying three key themes: (i) Integration/Interoperability between Ind 4.0, Circular Economy Model and Supply Chain Management to achieve Sustainability; (ii) Challenges & Emerging Opportunities for Tribal economy and (iii) Relationship between Ind 4.0, Supply Chain Management & Circular Economy. Furthermore, the paper proposes a conceptual framework in the form of “Barriers, Mitigation Strategies & Opportunities” associated with the integration of CE and Ind 4.0. This study would help in acknowledging the role of integrated systems (CE, Ind 4.0 and SCM) which may help in improving the current tribal working culture.}

abstract = {Policymakers, practitioners, and scholars have long-lauded digital technologies, such as smart waste containers or artificial intelligence for material recognition and robotic automation, as key enablers to more effective and efficient waste management. While these advances promise an increasingly digitalized future for collecting, sorting, and recycling waste material, little is known about the current extent of digitalization by waste management firms. Available studies focus on firms’ digitalization intentions, largely neglecting the level of actual adoption of digital technologies, and do not differentiate the level of digitalization alongside different steps of the waste management value chain. Our study reports on a cross-sectional descriptive survey that captures current digitalization efforts and strategies of 130 public and private waste management firms in Germany. We analyze their levels of digitalization along with different steps of the waste management value chain, explore their different objectives, approaches, and transformational measures with regard to digitalization. Our findings reveal that while the perceived importance of digitalization in the waste management sector continues to grow, the actual adoption of advanced digital technologies falls notably behind intentions reported in 2016 and 2017. We explore the reasons for this gap, point out so far largely ignored research opportunities, and derive recommendations for waste management firms and associations.}

Unlike conventional forms of corruption, smart corruption is disguised as progressive, and is thus difficult to spot or analyze through existing legal or ethical frameworks. To illustrate, we outline a satirical strategy for gaming accountability. Identifying the particular mechanisms and outcomes of transgressive activities carried out under the veneer of data-driven transparency, as well as the key actors and organizations most active in gaming accountability, is an important research and political project.}

Our study aims to determine how and where young people can be reached with news. It uses a mixed methods approach to analyze the expectations of young people towards news content and formats and to determine their news consumption patterns. The results show that young people’s news consumption is characterized by four dimensions: 1. duration and times of consumption, 2. news consumption habits and behavior, 3. restrictions, 4. media literacy. The significance of these dimensions varies between three age groups determined through the study. The news consumption of the 12-to-14 year-olds is strongly restricted by parents and school. This group consumes news mainly through media available at home. In the group of 15- to-17 year-olds, parental influence and restrictions decrease, while peer influence increases. This age group spends a lot of time on social media platforms where young people stumble upon news rather accidentally. Between 18 and 20 years of age, news consumption stabilizes, and individual patterns emerge. This age group accesses news via selected apps and social media channels. Young people in Switzerland prefer visual formats like pictures, videos, and memes. When scrolling through social media platforms, they come across news content which arouses their interest in certain information and leads them to search for it on media websites. Swiss Youth wants to be informed about relevant news or topics that are “in vogue”.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way people work and live. More people than ever work from home. Due to the sudden changes, leaders are faced with various challenges, such as the fear of loss of control or keeping their teams motivated. In this study, we explore the daily experiences of leaders aiming to work effectively while using digital tools and working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The overarching purpose of our study is to gain a better understanding about how leaders navigate the complexities of crisis-induced remote leadership by the use of digital tools by addressing the following questions: (1) Which practices do leaders use to deal with the complexities of day-to-day remote leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) How do different digital tools fit the diverse leadership practices? (3) What drives and inhibits leaders’ effectiveness in dealing with the complexities of remote leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic? To explore these research questions, we draw on longitudinal data from 155 qualitative diaries written by 31 leaders over a five-work-day period. We identify four categories of leadership practices, namely (1) solve problems collaboratively and monitor team progress, (2) create space for socialising and teambuilding, (3) make the team feel supported and encourage feedback and (4) communicate to build a virtual culture of trust. Our findings reveal that leaders demonstrate a broad repertoire of leadership practices, whereby relation orientation is more pronounced than task orientation. Moreover, leaders tend to focus on operational and team-oriented leadership practices, and they encounter the challenge of choosing the right digital tool to match their message. Our study’s results show that they use a variety of digital tools, but video conferences seem especially suitable for supporting remote leadership practices. However, several factors have impacts on remote leadership effectiveness, which we consider in the managerial implications.}

Chief among the potential legal hazards is one issue that has yet to be explored in journalism studies: the possibility that algorithms could produce libelous news content. Although the scenario may seem far-fetched, a review of legal cases involving algorithms and libel suggests that news organizations must seriously consider legal liability as they develop and deploy newswriting bots. Drawing on the American libel law framework, we outline two key issues to consider: (a) the complicated matter of determining fault in a case of algorithm-based libel, and (b) the inability of news organizations to adopt defenses similar to those used by Google and other providers of algorithmic content. These concerns are discussed in light of broader trends of automation and artificial intelligence in the media and information environment.}

abstract = {Agile approaches help software development project teams to better meet user needs and ensure flexibility in uncertain environments. But using agile approaches invites changes to the project and increases interactions between team members, which both cause interruptions in the workplace. While interruptions can help in task completion and increase process flexibility, they can also hinder employee productivity. We conducted an exploratory study of four agile software development teams. Our analysis identified (1) programming-related work impediments, (2) interaction-related interruptions, and (3) interruptions imposed by the external environment, which were managed by improved information retrieval and reduced team dependencies.}

abstract = {Promoting high-quality economic development, boosting high-level ecological environment protection, and integrating deeply digital economy and energy efficiency has become a general trend. This paper, based on 284 prefecture-level Chinese cities from 2008 to 2018, uses the entropy weight method and super-efficient SBM-DEA model to measure the digital economy and energy efficiency (decompose into energy pure technical efficiency and energy scale efficiency), respectively. After the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics, a fixed-effect model is constructed to study the impact of the digital economy on energy efficiency. The research results show that: (1) the development of the digital economy effectively promotes energy efficiency, mainly reflected in the improvement of pure technical efficiency of energy; (2) the development of both the digital economy and the energy efficiency in China has complex spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics, and there is heterogeneity in the impact of the digital economy on energy efficiency at the temporal and spatial levels; and (3) digital economy effectively improves energy efficiency by reducing unnecessary energy consumption through the R&D innovation effect. The development of the digital economy has far-reaching significance on the optimization and upgrading of the economic system, accelerating the improvement of energy efficiency and achieving green transformation.}

abstract = {Open Banking allows consumers to take advantage of data-driven financial services by sharing data held at one organization with another organization, typically between financial institutions and trusted third parties. Open Banking is consumer controlled, secure, and protects privacy. These new services represent an innovative and growing market. Clear and fair rules, industry coordination, and technical standards are needed to avoid fragmentation and to build a robust market that serves all consumers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). International developments in jurisdictions such as the UK and Australia have demonstrated the expected benefits that Open Banking can deliver to consumers. The challenge to governments in North America is to adopt a consistent framework that provides the security and protections consumers need while at the same time providing flexibility for innovation and streamlining of banking services using the Open Banking model. A key question for implementation of Open Banking will be the balance of activity and involvement between government and the private sector. An unbalanced Open Banking model will likely fail; a balanced Open Banking model can bring tremendous value to society. This teaching case asks students to first understand the benefits and challenges of Open Banking for many stakeholders, and then to recommend on how to proceed (or not) with implementation. The case is written from a North American perspective, that is, the USA and Canada.}

The drivers and the projects provide insight in the current research needs for the transformation and explains why safety researchers have to broaden their skill set to include digital skills and potentially even programming. The case for IT transformation of risk management systems is compelling, and this article describes just the tip of the iceberg of opportunities opening up for safety analysis that, after all, depends on data.}

Using secondary data from journalists (N = 1956) provided by the Korea Press Foundation, this study investigates the relationships among ideological differences between journalists and news organizations, advertising/public relations (ad/PR) work, journalists’ autonomy, and job cynicism. Findings suggest that both ideological incongruence and ad/PR work decreased journalistic autonomy, with the latter a stronger predictor than the former. Decreased autonomy, in turn, increased cynicism. Ad/PR work significantly predicted cynicism, but ideological incongruence did not influence cynicism. In addition, the more the news organization has adapted to the digital realm, the weaker the relations between ideological incongruence and autonomy and between autonomy and cynicism. However, as the adaptation level increased, the negative impact of ad/PR work on autonomy became stronger. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

From a human factors perspective, there is thus a need to further examine the usability issues and design guidelines of these emerging augmented reality technologies especially with regard to various manufacturing industries. Such assessment efforts will serve to ensure that the fit between human and machine allows for user self-actualization and a safe and productive work environment. Despite the widespread interest in augmented reality, there is no clear set of principles yet established. Many usability models are based on traditional desktop-based computer applications which means unique augmented reality characters are overlooked including the physical ergonomics, expanded field of view, and device mobility features. Here, we review the fit of user-centered usability models to propose a set of criteria to serve as a guideline to implement augmented reality technologies efficiently in the production environment.}

While the existing literature highlights the significance of understanding gender inequalities in the context of globalisation of professional firms and their practices, it has predominantly focused on the Anglo-Saxon context. There remains a gap in the literature regarding how gender inequalities are produced in professional hiring in the context of China. Drawing on qualitative material, this study explores the gendered processes of graduate hiring in elite professional firms in China. By applying the perspective of gender practices, this article elucidates how Chinese recruiters construct male favouritism and rig the selection process. The analysis sheds light on the processes that produce gender inequalities and hinder the progress of women in the context of growing competition and lack of support for women’s participation in professional work.}

Practices of making futures are increasingly online. Yet, as organizational participants come together online – organizing remotely to make offline futures – they lack the shared experiential knowledge that is gained through embodied and situated practices. In this essay, we argue that the lack of experiential knowledge makes future making online difficult to organize and vulnerable to excluding relevant expertise; dialogue may become inward-looking and self-referential within the online environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as a form of inquiry – as a distributed and reflective process that proceeds through engagement with representations of the future – we identify three remedial actions for online future making: to solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change medium. These remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack of shared experiential knowledge by both sustaining the online involvement of heterogeneous remote participants and by bringing in relevant (offline) places, people and materials to online future making.}

We show that once those pairs work together and become interdependent, they are more likely to create informal relationships (friendships and advice ties). Interdependence also increases the persistence of the informal ties that existed prior to team assignments; the magnitude of this effect decreases with tie strength. As organizations extend their use of teamwork, they also create and maintain social networks across functional and geographic boundaries. Thus, transitory project teams forge an enduring organizational legacy.}

However, empirical studies about the influences of organizational culture on accounting information system quality, especially in the context of emerging countries like Vietnam, where accounting information is not reliable enough for decision making, have not yet provided enough evidence to confirm this relationship. This paper aims to investigate the effect of innovative organizational culture on the quality of accounting information systems by using the Structural Equation Model. A questionnaire was sent to the CEO, CFO, managers, and accounting staff of non-financial enterprises in Vietnam. With 649 valid respondents, the two-step approach was carried out, including exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis and examining the significance of the coefficient through a path analysis. Our findings identified that organizational culture is an essential factor in enhancing the quality of accounting information systems of Vietnamese firms. Implementing an innovative corporate culture will improve system quality and information quality of the accounting information systems that help accounting information more sufficient for making decisions.}

However, when females from a lower caste have credit scores higher than the mean, the odds of receiving a loan increase. The practical effect of size is small but meaningful. Loan applicants from a lower caste with a visible signal of business ability do not improve their chances of receiving a loan relative to those from a higher caste.}

The use of IT in fundraising activities in NPOs has been studied in the past. But applying this concept in the case of Buddhist temples, which make up the majority of NPOs in a Buddhist country like Thailand, has never been done before. Using the national survey of 16,895 Buddhist temples in Thailand and econometrics modeling reveals that using IT in temple management has a statistically significant effect on generating higher income from fundraising activities. Using the Internet and computers can boost temple donations and fundraising by promoting religious activities. And temples that use websites and social media seem to receive more government subsidies. In addition, other variables, such as location, number of monks and staff, pro-social activities, and temple age, also represent strong determinants of fundraising performance. Therefore, we find that Buddhist temples in Thailand would do well to use the Internet and social media to develop content, provide advice, and preach online, as these technology-enhanced activities play an important role in increasing fundraising efficiency. Thus, training in such current communication technology should be provided to monks so that they can take advantage of such tools to not only increase their productivity, but also to equip themselves with other, up-to-date skills to enhance the religious education of their congregations that they currently provide through traditional preaching.}

In order to fill this gap, this article constructs a variable to measure the application degree of “digitalization” at the company level. By analyzing the text of the annual reports of Chinese listed companies from 2009 to 2020, the effective variables to measure “digitalization” are determined. Based on this, the development status and determinants of enterprise digital applications and the impact of digitalization on enterprise performance are discussed. Thus, by analyzing the panel data of these companies, the relationship among the age of the enterprise, the knowledge level of the board of directors, the proportion of fixed assets, the company’s assets, and the degree of enterprise digitalization are evaluated. At last, according to the evaluated results, the relationship between the degree of digitalization and the performance of enterprises is analyzed. In this article, our analysis helps to solve the “IT production paradox” problem, and also to provides data and theoretical support for digitalization to improve corporate performance to a certain extent. Furthermore, the digitalization measurement variable laid out in this article provides a foundation for future research on the relationship between digitalization and corporate performance.}

abstract = {Introduction The main objective of this review was to synthesize the progress, challenges and prospects of biomedical research in Saudi Arabia in order to provide a holistic view to all stakeholders, such as policy makers, decision makers, and local researchers along with external collaborators interested in the field of biomedical research in this region. Methods A systematic review was conducted using the scientific literature for bibliometric studies in the field of biomedical research in Saudi Arabia that comprehensively covered past few decades using PubMed. The search was performed by combining verified Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms: “biomedical research”, “bibliometrics”, “Saudi Arabia” using boolean operator “AND”. The data collection was done from January to June 2022 by both authors. Results Out of 202 articles yielded from initial search, 13 articles met all of the inclusion criteria and were examined in details. The outcome of analysis showed that with the augmentation of Research and Development (R&D) globalization in Saudi Arabia, researchers are publishing internationally and collaborating globally, academic and research centers are enriching research environment and policies, and government is taking many initiatives to bolster biomedical research; but still more improvements needs to be achieved by Saudi Arabia to be in the list of strong competitive leading nations in the global biomedical research field. Conclusions There were various key challenges related to biomedical publications and bibliometric aspects for Saudi Arabia that included: publishing preferences, quality of publications, indexing services, international scientific community, and importantly barriers related to planning, funding, training, resources and support at institutional and national levels. This review provided some insights and recommendations to enhance biomedical research in Saudi Arabia that included: effective policies, health priorities, building infrastructures, greater investments, high incentives, skilled recruitment, competitive training and engagement of community that can play a vital role in this context.}

abstract = {This study aims to determine the culture of corruption in the global government smart service system in the last 5 years, from 2018 to 2022. This research used a qualitative method with a library research approach. The research data was obtained from the Scopus database of 318 articles. Data analysis in this study used VOSviewer and NVivo 12 plus devices. Through 318 article documents, the results showed that the United Kingdom had the highest contribution of artistic documents, and the University of South Africa was affiliated with the highest number of document publications of the 10 other affiliates. The “moral and ethical” movement within government agencies is expected to restore trust in the community and create conditions for a social environment that rejects, even opposes, and punishes acts of corruption.}

A critical discourse analysis of the lexeme “Covid-19” and words accompanying it was applied. A total of 1736 English-language tweets (6844 lexical units) posted during March to April 2020 were selected for the analysis. Functional discourse analysis allowed systematising and commenting on sampling results as well as provided the opportunity to make the following conclusions. In tweets, the lexeme “Covid-19” is combined not only with the actual name of the virus. This lexeme became a productive ground for derivation into various linguistic structures: substantive word combinations, abbreviations, neologisms and anthropomorphic metaphors. The research results application in international practice will allow linguists to interpret neologisms that emerged as a result of the pandemic and foster the understanding of axiological indicators of native speakers.}

abstract = {Defense in Depth (DiD) has become an industry buzzword. But practicing DiD is easier said than done. While cybersecurity researchers have predominantly focused on securing corporate networks, there remains a serious gap in endpoint-threat awareness. Yet endpoint threats were the progenitor of 68% of breaches and hacks in 2019 (Computers Nationwide, 2022), a vulnerability that increased during the COVID-19 lockdown with relaxed BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies, more IoTs, and cheaper and larger USB flash drives. This teaching case uses the 2009 Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities to exemplify how a single USB drive was used as an endpoint threat to disrupt a nuclear infrastructure, drawing attention to the need for and how to practice DiD to counter towering complexities ushered in burgeoning endpoints cyberattacks, from hacks to ransomware. The case shows the need for DiD to simultaneously pay heed toward physical, technical, and processual (administrative) measures to prevent, defend, and mitigate cyberattacks, from hacks to ransomware. The case and its teaching notes highlight the opportunities and challenges of practicing DiD for endpoints, from flash drives to IoTs.}

The main reasons for this trend are, for example, cost reductions through scaling, the temporary inclusion of specific skills in the own organization as well as the joint development of innovative solutions with an external partner. The client organization “RetBa,” a major private insurance company, was facing serious quality and performance issues in the delivery of the workplace services. Hence, in 2005 they decided for an outsourcing solution aiming at moving the responsibility for managing IT workplace services for over 50,000 seats worldwide to the external service provider “EuTu.” Over the years, the outsourcing project faced several problems due to the lack of performance and delayed delivery of services by the service provider EuTu. To solve these quality issues and avoid further failures, in 2011 RetBa appointed Scaleit Consulting, a third-party advisor. Scaleit Consulting had the responsibility to identify the causes for these issues, revise the workplace strategy, and support RetBa in the communication with the service provider.}

The study is based on the analysis of 9,479 online reviews, posted on TripAdvisor.com, pertaining to 220 French hotels. The findings highlight that ENRR is judged as being more helpful when the hotel has been awarded a certificate of excellence, and when the average rating score and the hotel classification are higher. On the basis of these results, we recommend that managers of higher category hotels, with a certificate of excellence and with higher average score ratings, pay more attention to extremely negative judgments.}

These subscription B2B solutions are becoming increasingly common, yet offer challenges for long-term renewal if value is not consistently realized by the customer. To address this concern, customer success (CS) management has emerged. CS management is based on regular proactive action taken by the seller to (a) educate, prepare, and engage customers for value co-creation; (b) demonstrate the value delivered by the solution; and (c) provide a channel for advocacy on behalf of customers within the service-providing firm. Our findings highlight the under-researched topic of CS in B2B settings. Specifically, we propose the CS function and role as a structural alternative to within-person (i.e., cross-functional) ambidexterity and emphasize the ability of a CS focus by service firms to complement existing firm operations in value creation efforts. Our case study analysis provides a multilevel perspective (i.e., executive, functional role employees, and customers) via in-depth interviews that offer unique insights on “how parts of the service-sales system work together.” Overall, CS is growing as a practice that propagates value to the customer via ongoing success with solutions while improving service-firm renewal and growth of subscription business.}

The developed theoretical framework is a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), wherein the trust, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use act as mediators for the intention to use E-commerce. As such, five cultural dimensions were employed in the proposed model. These are; uncertainty avoidance, power distance, masculinity, collectivism, and long-term orientation. Data was collected from a non-probabilistic sample of 418 participants using a pre-tested and validated questionnaire. Findings demonstrate that the hypothesized model was able to explain 62% of the variability of the intention towards the use of E-commerce. In particular, they signify a strong correlation between acceptance of E-commerce and the domestic culture of consumers, where uncertainty avoidance and power distance are the most vital cultural dimensions influencing the decision to transact online.}

abstract = {Autonomous driving systems (ADS) operate in an environment that is inherently complex. As these systems may execute a task without the permission of a human agent, they raise major safety and responsibility issues. To identify the relevant issues for information systems, we conducted a critical and scoping review of the literature from many disciplines. The innovative methodology we used combines bibliometrics techniques, grounded theory, and a critical conceptual framework to analyse the structure and research themes of the field. Our findings show that there are certain ironies in the way in which responsibility for apparently safe autonomous systems is apportioned. These ironies are interconnected and reveal that there remains significant uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. The ironies draw attention to the challenges of safety and responsibility with ADS and possibly other cyber-physical systems in our increasingly digital world. We make seven recommendations related to 1) value sensitive design and system theory approaches; 2) stakeholders’ interests and interactions; 3) task allocation; 4) deskilling; 5) controllability; 6) responsibility (moral and legal); 7) trust. We suggest five areas for future IS research on ADS. These areas are related to socio-technical systems, critical research, safety, responsibility, and trust.}

Doing so, those in a position to provide resources that might facilitate coping and recovery are attentive to the situations of distress. Despite an abundance of leadership theorizing and models, there still is little academic literature on compassionate leadership. To address this limitation, we present an exploratory case study of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, someone widely recognized for her compassionate leadership and frequently described in paradoxical terms (e.g. “kind and strong”; embodying “steel and compassion”). We address her compassionate leadership through the lenses of paradox theory, legitimacy theory and conservation of resources theory. We contribute a heuristic framework that sees various types of legitimacy leveraged synergistically to build resources and alleviate suffering – providing further legitimacy in an upward spiral of compassionate leadership.}

This issue is particularly serious for web surveys: A recent meta-analysis found that unit nonresponse in web surveys is, on average, higher by 12 percentage points than in other modes (Daikeler et al., 2020). Although the issue of unit nonresponse in web and other survey modes has been investigated in several meta-analyses, item nonresponse has not been examined meta-analytically, a gap addressed by this paper. Are web surveys at a disadvantage compared to other survey modes in terms of item nonresponse as well? To address this question, 13 eligible experimental manuscripts reporting 23 effect sizes were identified in a comprehensive literature search. Meta-analytic findings showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the average item nonresponse rate in web versus other survey modes. However, six moderator variables were found to statistically significantly affect the relation between the survey mode and the item nonresponse rate, namely, the target population, the number of contacts, the mode to which the web survey mode was compared, the survey sponsor, the age of the survey, and the baseline item nonresponse rate of the compared mode. The main practical implication is that while web and other survey modes differ in terms of unit nonresponse (on average), item nonresponse rates in web surveys are similar compared to other modes.}

abstract = {The globalization revolution has led to many countries considering advancing technology, which has led to electronic finance becoming an important aspect in all economic and financial sectors. This study aims to investigate the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on the financial development index of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries from the period 2000 to 2016. The results are reported in terms of two main ICT variables: fixed broadband and Internet users as a proxy of ICT and domestic credit to private sector as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) and broad money supply/GDP as two proxies of the financial development index. This methodology used fixed effects (FEs) estimations, and the results show that an increase in fixed broadband has a statistically significant and positive effect on both proxies of financial development. In terms of domestic credit as a percentage of the GDP proxy, the positive effects of ICT (broadband) are greater than the one from Internet users. A 1% increase in fixed broadband leads to approximately 2% increase in financial development, but the Internet user variable resulted in about a 0.09% increase. The other money supply proxy increased by 0.40% when ICT increased by 1%. Additionally, money supply increased by 0.11% when the Internet user ratio increased by 1% .To control for the endogeneity problem, the study used a generalized method of moments estimator, and the results confirm the previous results of the FE. Moreover, the negative impact of economic growth and natural resources was found to be valid and significant, while urbanization and trade openness were found to significantly and positively affect both financial development proxies. The main conclusion of the study is that GCC countries should take action in building an effective joint information system to help construct efficient economic sectors.}

This paper proposes to take seriously the critical knowledge developed in information and computer science and reinterpret their debates to develop a critical intervention into the public controversies concerning data-driven security and digital surveillance. The paper offers a two-pronged contribution: on the one hand, we challenge the credibility of security professionals’ discourses in light of the knowledge that they supposedly mobilize; on the other, we argue for a series of conceptual moves around data, human–computer relations, and algorithms to address some of the limitations of existing engagements with the Big Data-security assemblage.}

Hierarchical regression results reveal that job satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between employee compensation, career planning, training and development and performance. However, the findings support the full mediation of job satisfaction in the relationship between performance appraisal and performance. Further, the study also supports the hypotheses that (a) training and development is a moderator in the relationship between performance appraisal and job satisfaction and between career planning and job satisfaction, and (b) employee compensation is a moderator in the relationship between job satisfaction and performance.

abstract = {Like many other industries worldwide, the Danish architecture, engineering and construction industry is currently undergoing digitisation of knowledge, processes and standards. While digitisation promises great improvements in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, not everyone is convinced that digitisation will always lead to the hoped for benefits. In this article, I explore a number of prominent concerns that Danish fire safety professionals have raised with regards to ongoing efforts to digitise their knowledge and expertise. The focus on digitisation is deliberate, as I suggest that scrutinising the implications and concerns raised by professionals in digitisation can help us foresee unintended, potentially dangerous, consequences, of digitalisation. In building on anthropological fieldwork, I argue that professionals are concerned about digitising fire safety, and its potentially dark results, because they worry that digitisation may dislocate “mētis” from “techne”, and that digital outputs may be misunderstood or not applied correctly. Such a turn of events could lead not just to material losses (e.g. destroyed buildings), but to the loss of human lives too. This “concern” with life and death thus appears to underpin the fire safety professionals’ belief in the importance of dialogue in organizationally complex circumstances, and their hesitance to engage with digitisation. On this basis, I propose that by shifting from a resistance and apprehension framework to a concern and dialogue framework, we may be able to foster more empathetic, productive and understanding collaborations within and across organisations during both digitisation and digitalisation.}

abstract = {Background Healthcare delivery will change through the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI). Physicians are likely to be among the professions most affected, though to what extent is not yet clear. Objective We analyzed physicians’ and AI experts’ stances towards AI-induced changes. This concerned (1) physicians’ tasks, (2) job replacement risk, and (3) implications for the ways of working, including human–AI interaction, changes in job profiles, and hierarchical and cross-professional collaboration patterns. Methods We adopted an exploratory, qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews with 24 experts in the fields of AI and medicine, medical informatics, digital medicine, and medical education and training. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. Results Specialized tasks currently performed by physicians in all areas of medicine would likely be taken over by AI, including bureaucratic tasks, clinical decision support, and research. However, the concern that physicians will be replaced by an AI system is unfounded, according to experts; AI systems today would be designed only for a specific use case and could not replace the human factor in the patient–physician relationship. Nevertheless, the job profile and professional role of physicians would be transformed as a result of new forms of human–AI collaboration and shifts to higher-value activities. AI could spur novel, more interprofessional teams in medical practice and research and, eventually, democratization and de-hierarchization. Conclusions The study highlights changes in job profiles of physicians and outlines demands for new categories of medical professionals considering AI-induced changes of work. Physicians should redefine their self-image and assume more responsibility in the age of AI-supported medicine. There is a need for the development of scenarios and concepts for future job profiles in the health professions as well as their education and training.}

abstract = {Product development outsourcing and off-shoring, especially in a high-technology industry such as Satellite Communications, is done by carefully considering the choice of the partner and the operating business model. From the satellite communications company’s (Client’s) perspective, outsourcing and off-shoring work is a strategic decision that involves considering whether to have a captive off-shore center for resource augmentation or outsource to a third-party partner organization. Furthermore, there are decisions regarding choosing a suitable trustworthy partner organization, pricing models, and the viability of a long-term relationship that involves in-life product management and protection of Intellectual Property ownership. From the partner’s (Vendor’s) viewpoint, there are several strategic and tactical decisions involving technical solution and engineering development strategy, selecting a mutually acceptable pricing model, and analyzing the risks involved in developing the high-tech product away from customer location. This case analyzes the outsourcing and off-shoring engagement between a leading provider of satellite communications and a product engineering services company in India. This case brings out the strategic perspectives of the client–vendor engagement in building a satellite communications product.}

Using appropriate estimation windows, 13 different sporting events classified as large, including mega and major events, were tested. The obtained results show that, in principle, one day after the announcement of the host of a large sporting event, an average positive reaction of 0.22% is observed on national stock exchanges. The analyzed events were also classified as being neutral for capital markets or generating positive or negative reactions when the host country is announced to the public.}

abstract = {As Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), such as the internet and mobile phones, facilitate the spread of knowledge and interactions across borders in previously unimagined ways, questions are being asked about whether the benefits of this digitization process are equally distributed between and within countries. Motivated by the way technology adoption and usage patterns may differ in the Arab Middle East, this paper examines how the Kuwaiti context shapes people’s understanding of a survey instrument used for evaluating digital inequalities, as they relate to access, skills and engagement, and outcomes of ICT use. Specifically, it discusses the adaptation and validation of the survey measures of socio-digital inequalities through a process of cognitive interviewing and provides insight into the theoretical and empirical linkages between cultural conceptions of digital and traditional inequalities in ways that explore both their universal and contextual aspects, or denotative and connotative meanings. Evidence suggests that important cross-cultural complications relate to language issues, socio-economic conditions, citizenship, and differing perceptions of social desirability. These findings offer important considerations for improving the reliability and validity of future survey-scale adaptations in the broader MENA region, especially in countries containing significant multicultural populations. Simultaneously, they call into question the extent to which global conceptualizations of digital inequalities and their measures reflect complex local realities.}

abstract = {The role of urban infrastructure is becoming increasingly interdependent, resulting in new sources of vulnerability. Infrastructural asset failure can propagate between rail transportation and other infrastructure networks. There remains a lack of academic research focusing on the dynamic simulation of city-wide infrastructure using real-life data to quantify and cross-compare the criticality of assets. This paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a modeling methodology for interdependent urban infrastructure using complex network theory, which serves as a basis for investigating asset criticality and failure propagation. This modeling framework comprises the distribution of resource supply and demand, the topological representation and skeletonization of the infrastructure network, as well as modeling the propagation of asset failures. The framework is thereafter applied to a case study of the exposure of Greater London’s rail transportation network to failures from electricity infrastructure, selected as a representative example of interdependent infrastructures within a large-scale urban metropolitan area. Two time-based criticality metrics are also proposed to measure the topological extent of infrastructural failures and economic impacts resulting from the failure propagation of given initial failure scenarios. The results of the case study demonstrate that these proposed criticality metrics are effective in capturing the dynamics of failure propagation, and that topological metrics in criticality assessment do not always reflect the resulting economic damages of infrastructural failures.}

Even though AI is considered an unprecedented disruptive force for work automation, much can be learned from current research on the computerization of work. Drawing on the seminal work of Shoshana Zuboff, this article provides a balanced perspective on the dual affordances of AI systems for automating and informating work. Whereas AI offers unique capacities for automating cognitive work that once required high-skill workers, it may be a source of unintended consequences such as cognitive complacency or de-skilling workers. To overcome such effects, the informating capacities of AI systems can be invoked to augment work, generate a more comprehensive perspective on organization, and finally equip workers with new sets of intellectual skills.}

However, it is not clear whether these legal reforms at EU and at national level are reaching local institutions. The study evaluates the degree of compliance of the Greater Metropolitan Area of Barcelona by analysing a set of indicators divided into five main areas: codes of ethics, oversight bodies, transparency, conflicts of interests, and whistleblowing channels and protection. The results show that, even if there are also positive outcomes, the process of transforming the public administration and its contracting bodies towards a culture of integrity or risk management is still far from complete at local levels, and there are still institutional and normative shortcomings in terms of anti-corruption strategy and planning that should be promptly addressed. Points for practitioners This article explores the impact of the current anti-corruption legislation on local governments and public bodies. It analyses the state of development of four key public procurement areas of action within the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, gathering 170 entities of different legal nature and size. The results show that the impact of European and national legislations seems to be still weak in local administrative structures, although the degree of development varies significantly among different types of entities.}

With the rise of social media as news sources, algorithms operate as gatekeepers, which may alter linkages between public opinion, journalists, and media trust. However, results from a panel-survey conducted in the U.S. underline citizens’ preference for journalist gatekeeping in fueling trust in traditional and social media news. Conversely, preference for algorithmic news selection does not affect people’s levels of trust. Furthermore, traditional news use moderates this relationship as those who report higher traditional news use and a preference for professional news gatekeeping trust traditional news the most. This study contributes to current discussions on the effects of preference for journalists’ or algorithmic news selection, arguing that evaluations of journalists’ editorial work remain critical to explain media trust.}

The analysis states how a lack of attention is triggering a sense of urgency for the future of literary reading. Further, the digital transition entails an overarching ambivalence. Key stakeholders in literary publishing are experiencing how media on platform-based streaming services is competing with traditional reading. They perceive a battle for time and question the future of reading. From the perspectives of Bourdieu’s theory, the article reveals how penetrating connectivity is leading to a change in the professional habitus. Continuous busyness and increased professional presence are triggering ambivalence between work-related duties and personal well-being. Moreover, the publishing stakeholders reveal an ambivalence in voicing future expectations. While worried about the future of reading, the professional habitus leans on a promising future for the industry.}

abstract = {In theories about journalism’s democratic remit, trust is generally regarded as a prerequisite for public connection: only when citizens believe the news, they will engage with it and act upon it to perform their citizenship. Trust seems even more important in today’s digital society, where the destabilization of journalism institutions and proliferation of sources make the media ecology increasingly complex to navigate. This paper challenges such conceptualizations of media trust rooted in rationality and deliberateness. Based on two series of semistructured interviews with fifty-five young people from ten nationalities living in the Netherlands, conducted in 2016 and 2017, we develop a taxonomy of people’s tactics when assessing the reliability of news. We explore what this means for how they value news and how such judgments, drawing on explicit and tacit knowledge, impact their news use. Rather than critically evaluating news through comparing and checking sources, users often employ more pragmatic shortcuts to approximate the trustworthiness of news, including affective and intuitive tactics rooted in tacit knowledge. Consequently, we argue that to fully understand how users deal with the complexity of trust in digital environments, we should not start from ideals of informed citizenship, but from people’s actual practices and experiences instead.}

The empirical results show that: (i) the digital economy has a significant inhibitory effect on per capita carbon emissions. (ii) The mechanism analysis shows that the digital economy can indirectly affect per capita carbon emissions by affecting technological innovation. (iii) The threshold effect of trade openness and energy intensity is significant. Under high openness and low energy intensity, the digital economy has a stronger inhibitory effect on per capita carbon emissions.

Simultaneously, studies on the use of gamification techniques have emerged in diverse fields, including computer science, education, and healthcare. Despite the broad popularity of gamification in other fields, it has received only limited attention in the service literature. Moreover, the findings of extant studies on gamification in the service field are inconclusive and suggest an incomplete understanding of the employment of gamification in service contexts. Thus, this study aims to integrate the growing but scattered cross-disciplinary literature on gamification and to emphasize its relevance to service research. Specifically, we first conceptualize gamification for service and differentiate it from related concepts. Then, using a systematic literature review, we identify 34 empirical articles that reflect this gamification conceptualization and can be connected to relevant service research themes (e.g., customer participation, experience, and loyalty). Employing activity theory, we derive four higher-order functions of gamification: production, consumption, exchange, and distribution. Finally, we develop a research agenda to generate a better understanding of the central aspects within each of the identified gamification functions and stimulate future academic efforts on gamification in services.}

In doing so, the article explores three interrelated elements: the transatlantic technology gap and the EU’s quest for technological sovereignty, approaches to technological innovation and the role of emerging and disruptive technologies, and the values-based governance of digital and technology issues. As fast-paced technological transformation continues to disrupt societies and economies on both sides of the Atlantic, technology should be at the heart of a revived phase in EU–US cooperation and trust.}

How, we ask, have African political parties made use of WhatsApp to organize internally during elections, and what explains the approaches they have taken? We argue that pre-existing party institutionalization is the main factor influencing how parties use WhatsApp to organize and coordinate campaign events, and reach voters. Comparing Ghana and Nigeria, we show that more institutionalized parties create formal, hierarchical online structures, with in-group policing of message content. Conversely, less institutionalized parties rely on informal, personality-based online structures with unclear hierarchies and where there is little message discipline. This matters both for the spread of mis/disinformation and inflammatory content online, and for parties’ future organizational strength. In both instances, “digital clientelism” ensures that existing patrimonial structures are replicated online, restricting the empowerment of new political actors.}

These changes are the result of multiple, varying influences, such as external institutional feedback. The issue of digitalization feedback development in public organizations opens the discussion on how to study digitalization over time. In this article, we consider whether the method of quantitative text analysis can be used to observe the same administrative trends in digitalization as found using other methods and data sources in existing research. After conducting a co-occurrence analysis of documents from the Norwegian Customs Agency (NCA) over a period of 20 years, we found that the NCA’s digitalization-related language changed in this period and that user feedback was the most frequently emphasized kind of external feedback. These observations are consistent with the literature, which shows that the use of co-occurrence methodology to study public administration has a positive role in future research. Points for practitioners Quantitative text analysis is an effective method to observe administrative trends. Findings of the study corroborate with previous research showing that current administrative trends emphasize collaboration between public organizations and citizen participation as central development features of digitalization of public organizations. The co-occurrence analysis has some limitations and needs to be further improved to develop theory and identify new areas of public administration digitalization.}

abstract = {Saxony remains a hot spot for far-right mobilization making it a prominent case for studying Neonazi-networks as well as broader issues of challenges for democracy. Local and regional mobilization has intensified during the political contestation of migration 2013ff. with Dresden’s PEGIDA becoming a benchmark for regional regressive movements. During the pandemic, we observed yet another uptick in far-right mobilization, again deeply rooted in local networks that existed before the crisis and leading to a specific dynamic distinct from other regions in Germany. To explain this phenomenon, it is important to consider regional and local characteristics of identity formation, perceptions of “winner-and-loser” dichotomies, and the broader challenges of global and European inequalities. As this contribution argues, here lie yet idle potentials for the comparative study of Euroscepticism and place.}

abstract = {How do future-of-news experts construct accounts of the future of journalism and on what do they base these accounts? What do their methods imply about manifest and latent reasons for constructing these accounts in the first place? This exploratory study adapts a model from the sociology of work, which provides a typology of strategies that guide decision-making in “future work” – that is, work that involves collective and systematic efforts to predict and legitimize predictive claims. We first examine economic literature on uncertainty and risk, which explains the extreme difficulty of making predictions in an environment of high uncertainty. We then situate journalism “future work” within the literature on the social construction of the future, and using Fine’s model, outline strategies pursued in this construction. We conduct an exploratory qualitative content analysis of published predictions written by “future of news” experts, examining the strategies they use to legitimize their predictive claims. Findings show mixed support for Fine’s model and some support for rival strategies for supporting claims about the future, for example, a path-dependence strategy of extending the known present into the future.}

abstract = {The demand for safe, reliable, and higher-quality infrastructure systems often increases the complexity of transportation construction projects and necessitates more comprehensive evaluation methods. This often leads to the incorporation of technologies for oversight and management. With a focus on effective technology implementation, this research stretches beyond simply evaluating technologies to consider integrating the technology with personnel and procedures at departments of transportation (DOTs). Drawing from literature and a survey of state DOT personnel, this study applies and evaluates maturity models for people, process, and technology with regard to technology implementation at DOTs. The findings support the need for understanding technology implementation in the aspects of people, process, and technology maturity to improve the probability of implementation success. The framework allows DOTs to move toward higher maturity levels and improve the likelihood of implementation success. The study’s objective is to assess the importance of people, process, and technology as implementation dimensions that state DOTs need to focus on for successfully implementing technologies. The idea and scope of the paper can be extended to any new technology implementation efforts at DOTs, including Automatic Identification and Data Capture technologies, emerging sensing and wireless technologies, safety technologies, and others. The maturity models presented enable organizations to audit and benchmark their status for technology implementation, and the relative levels allow these organizations to advance from basic to advanced stages. This paper introduces three maturity models for people, process, and technology, their adaptation to DOT operations, and their possible future use, as presented through preliminary survey results. The final result of this study provides a maturity model methodology for successful technology implementation and a self-assessment tool for state DOTs to gauge and improve their current maturity levels. Preliminary validation of these products was conducted via a workshop of subject matter experts, and the results indicate that state DOTs can use these products to self-assess their organization’s maturity and devise a plan as required for improved technology implementation.}

However, what drives manufacturing enterprises in Vietnam to innovate themselves and how well they perform in coping with business obstacle remains one of the central questions in the extent of studies. Therefore, this research primarily attempts to establish how innovation investment and obstacles affect technological and non-technological innovations, especially in the growth phase of the industry life cycle (ILC), with an analysis of available data obtained from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam and World Bank Enterprise Survey data with the use of descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The outcome of this article highlights that researchers and practitioners should consider the importance of the industry life cycle in the choice of technological or non-technological innovation through third significant contributions. First, the innovation investment is driven by R&D, and formal training enables both technological- and non-technological innovation. Second, the innovation obstacle related to finance, policy, competition, and regulation directly impacts the choice of innovation activities. Third, this study demonstrates that the firm’s engagement in technological- and non-technological innovation in line with innovation investment can help maintain successful post-innovation performance.}

abstract = {Public Service Delivery (PSD), a basic responsibility of any democratic nation, is understood as the equitable, transparent and efficient deliverance of various public goods and services to its citizens. Prudent application of digital technologies, particularly Emerging Technologies (ETs) and associated software applications, can serve as a valuable tool to catalyse governance towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While adhering to the principles of good governance. In view of this, the present study is an attempt to first elucidate some global best practices of ETs such as Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, robotic process automation, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to articulate the objectives of similar technology application in inspirational terms for PSD in India. Second, it summarises the challenges about the utilisation and exploitation of such technology implementations in the context of developing countries such as India. Based on learnings emanating from these two objectives, the study establishes that a refurbished approach towards digital governance is the need of the hour. This new approach must be citizen-centric, innovative and citizen-inclusive, as the literature affirms that civic participation is a prerequisite while deploying digital technologies. This inspires the authors to propose a model that is co-created with citizens to address the contextual needs and aspirations of citizenry. The successful implementation of the proposed model insists on the presence of a flexible and responsive legal and regulatory system too. The present study may be useful for public administrators and policy makers in understanding the Indian character of using and creating a sustainable digital architecture for PSD that would go a long way in revamping Public Services 4.0 under the ambit of newer Government 4.0 to achieve SDGs by 2030.}

abstract = {The use of algorithms and automation of public services is not new, but in recent years there has been a step change in processing power and a decrease in the price of these technologies, which means we are seeing more widespread use. These advances are reframing our perception of what matters in ways that impact the ethical dimensions of day-to-day life. In turn, these changes challenge long-standing assumptions about public service ethics and how it is taught. In this multidisciplinary authored paper, we argue that public service leaders must be attentive to ethical questions that converge around adopting “data-driven” techniques, including algorithmic decision-making. Algorithmic and technology focused ethics question assumptions about the current deficits within public service ethics pedagogy in public service programs and university programs and the future direction of the discipline. To do so raises longstanding but neglected questions about the public services’ role in the state and recovering what Rohr refers to as the “ethics of the office.” This, we argue, will have implications for teaching public service ethics.}

Many colleges and universities now encounter challenges of continuing to teach face-to-face amidst the health emergency. As a result, institutions have sought innovative means to maintain teaching and learning. Universities in the United States and across the world have made unexpected and abrupt switch to distance learning. While we acknowledge this reality, the future of learning after the pandemic still appears to be uncertain. Many students and teachers are unfamiliar navigating themselves in the emergent learning environment. Often, in a time of crisis like a pandemic, instructional designers (IDs) are the front-line of defense to providing pragmatic solutions. IDs are expected to provide creative and innovative remedies to transform teaching and learning while averting crisis. This study investigates the experiences of instructional designers, and faculty undergoing this transformative change. The strategies and experiences of implementing emergency remote teaching and working are discussed with the aim of informing stakeholders how the pandemic impacted positively to teaching and learning using emergent technology.}

Archival data from a publisher in Milan are used to analyze the characteristics of customers who purchased sheet music between 1814 and 1823. To avoid contemporary depictions of cultural hierarchies (e.g. “highbrow”, “lowbrow” and “omnivorous” tastes), we offer a new method for considering both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of music consumption. Considering both the aggregate level of music consumption and the evolution of individual patterns over time, we find little evidence that musical tastes were aligned with class position. This finding calls for more research on the origins of the strong link between social structure and cultural preferences in general, or between class position and musical tastes in particular, which we witness today.}

Data Source: PubMed and Google Scholar search (2008-2023) was conducted using keywords related to telepharmacy, telemedicine, telehealth, and rural communities. Study Selection and Data Extraction: The inclusion criteria for the review include peer-reviewed articles published in English language and studies that focus on the implementation and evaluation of telepharmacy in rural communities. Data Synthesis: In all articles used, access to quality health care in rural communities has been a persistent challenge in Africa. Digital technologies such as telemedicine, telepharmacy, and artificial intelligence were reported to have emerged as promising solutions to improve health care access and outcomes in rural communities. Telepharmacy, in particular, has the potential to provide medication-related services to patients irrespective of one’s location. However, the implementation of telepharmacy in Africa has been slow, and there are several barriers affecting its integration and adoption in rural communities that include access to technology, limited infrastructure, and regulatory challenges. Gaps and limitations in the existing research on telepharmacy in rural communities were highlighted from the articles. Conclusion: Telepharmacy can improve health care access and outcomes in rural communities by bridging the gap between pharmacists and patients. However, the lack of infrastructure, inadequate funding, and regulatory challenges pose significant barriers to its implementation. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring the potential of telepharmacy to improve health care in rural communities in Africa.}

Against this background, it explores the complex web of synergies and trade-offs between the three transitions, examines the disjointed manner in which EU social policy has so far developed, and demonstrates the controversial stance of the EU’s overarching strategic framework – the European Green Deal – on the issue of a socially just transition. It also maps key research foci and gaps deserving further study, including the role of key players in the transition.}

The study utilized a specially developed questionnaire, carried out through an online survey, as a means of collecting data from library users (students and teachers). The study population includes 102 random library patrons, including 64 students and 38 teachers who were using services of academic libraries in China at the time. Through comparison with other studies, the quarantine responses of Chinese libraries were identified. The results of the study show that COVID-19 responses of libraries in China went in a direction similar to those in Italy, but the final decisions varied because of different levels of technological development. This knowledge may be used by libraries to identify areas for improvement. The results show that Chinese libraries were more effective in overcoming quarantine restrictions than those in Italy. The overwhelming majority of respondents reported that they had positive experience learning remotely and would not mind if distance learning programs continue to function after the pandemic is over.}

Built on the idea that today’s innovation requires continuous interaction, the design of innovation districts incorporates a density of living and working amenities to accommodate a 24-7 live–work–play environment. At the heart of the innovation district strategies are the entrepreneurs meant to benefit from the built-in supports that help them scale their ideas and introduce products to the market. Despite an embrace by policymakers, to date, there has been little systematic analysis and critique of innovation district strategies or attempts to understand them as tools of neoliberal urban economic development. This article tracks how planners and other city development officials endorsed innovation districts during the Global Financial Crisis. The districts were a stopgap policy measure to accumulate economic benefits while waiting for market activity to resume. Furthermore, this paper argues that the emergence of innovation district strategy points to new governance arrangements that shift the burden of urban revitalization onto entrepreneurs who catalyze growth through their consumption and production activities. The findings are based on content analysis, site observations, and interviews with the creators, implementers, stakeholders, and users of innovation districts in Boston, St. Louis, and Dublin.}

abstract = {Over the past decade, media labs have become an increasingly visible structure to create, catalyse and diffuse innovation within, and beyond, journalism. In this article, we offer insights into the multiple forms media labs can take, and how innovation in the media field is being organised through labs. As such, we focus on innovation processes and practices rather than innovative outcomes. Drawing on 45 semi-structured interviews with media labs around the globe, conducted between 2016 and 2018, this exploratory study explores the multifaceted nature of the media lab concept across academia, legacy media and independent structures. To help better understand the many different manifestations of the media lab construct encountered in our study, this article adopts a purposefully interdisciplinary approach spanning open innovation, institutional and social theories to illuminate and sense-make the global lab phenomena. First, we unpack the media lab construct by detailing the where, what and how of the media labs surveyed in this study. We then suggest that the many forms and functions of labs reveal a complex and nuanced picture of an innovation landscape. We trace this across the ways in which media labs perceive their own roles, and how they relate to wider networks and ecosystems that they engage with, specifically the extent of the openness of their activities. Ultimately, we suggest that media labs are in part shaped by mimetic, coercive and normative isomorphism: media labs are a replicated structure and signifier for innovation but do not exhibit absolute replication: they still retain local variation and mutation, which is influenced by localised factors or influences that are unique to them. They take myriad forms, are located across industry and academia, open, interdisciplinary and, for the main, focus on immediate innovation using user-centred innovation approaches.}

abstract = {Organizations should constantly improve their business processes to increase performance while keeping employees satisfied. Therefore, human actors are considered a success factor in business process management (BPM) projects. This fact amplifies the impact of employees’ satisfaction on business process performance. Although several reward approaches exist, it remains unclear how they affect job satisfaction specifically in combination with certain process characteristics. To address this gap, we conducted a statistical analysis of survey data based on a representative European working conditions dataset. We applied two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA, i.e., controlled for organization size and sector) to explore the interaction effects. By looking at all possible combinations, we uncover how the presence or absence of specific pay modes and process-related aspects influence job satisfaction. Additionally, we reveal and discuss the joint effect of process characteristics and pay-for-performance types on job satisfaction. The results argue for a differentiated approach in pay-for-performance to obtain optimal reward solutions. Moreover, we advise for better strategic planning and facilitating successful BPM implementation.}

However, recently, due to technological development, using a traditional approach to BPM is not enough anymore. The answer to the limitations of the traditional BPM has been found in the introduction and application of the social software principles in the management of business processes within a new and emerging area called social BPM. In order to investigate its implementation and usage within the companies, a literature review has been conducted. It confirmed that social BPM is a developing phenomenon. Overall, 31 papers with case studies dealing with the usage of social BPM have been selected for further analysis. The case studies have been analysed with regard to structure, process and content dimensions as well as risk management and crisis.}

In a time of restrictions and physical distancing, the role of the digital for social inclusion—especially for older adults—was heightened with many having to care at a distance. Our study focuses on older adults from Wuhan and the role of the dominant social media app, WeChat, for intergenerational informal care through digital literacy during and after the pandemic. Often characterized in global media as the place where the virus began, many of the quotidian experiences of Wuhan people have been overlooked. We reflect upon ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Wuhan in 2020–2021 with 10 households. We are particularly interested in how kinship care practices in Wuhan households—as sites for complex configurations of intergenerational practices that converge digital, social, and material worlds—have shifted during the pandemic. We ask: what are the learnings, opportunities and limitations around smartphone apps like WeChat for informal care as part of filial piety? In sum, what are the possibilities and limitations for mobilizing care?}

While the broad influence and consequences of disruptive digital technology are increasingly taken for granted, very little research focuses on the deliberate use of digital technology for social purpose. This study is situated within three areas of literature: disruption caused by digital innovations, the use of digital technology by social purpose organizations, and social entrepreneurship. The process of digital social venture emergence and evolution shows how flashy-sounding technological solutions develop into more modest and incrementally useful tech-supported adjuncts. A preliminary framework for conceptualizing the nature and process of digital social ventures shows how a Schumpeterian approach to social entrepreneurship as disrupting equilibrium gives way to a Hayekian approach as drawing on local, embedded knowledge to achieve incremental change.}

This study builds a conceptual model of technological instantiation of regulatory practices in financial markets. We observe how asset management firms instantiate technology as a material and social artefact to regulate the actions and behaviour of human agents. The structural-agency divide reveals the coercive role of regulators who impose stringent compliance practices on financial organizations by embedding formal rules and regulations in the software. Socio-technical conditions show how human agents interpret and apply these rules to circumvent formal regulatory policies and practices. Context-specific analysis shows technological performativity and agencement co-exist in financial fields that are becoming more entangled and fragmented. Regulators respond with more complex mandates to reduce entropy in financial markets characterized by extreme volatility and instability.}

This will deliver huge opportunities for healthcare providers to deliver more individualized treatments for patients, and as such improve outcomes. Nowhere is the prospect greater than in cancer care. Healthcare providers now need to manage the challenge of how to best capture, interpret and exploit insights from real-world clinical data. A significant aspect of cancer care is the challenge of preparing and conducting tumor boards. Currently, data are distributed across multiple systems and cannot be easily aggregated or integrated. In recognition that no suitable solution existed, the University of Missouri School of Medicine, in partnership with Roche, have co-developed and co-implemented a digital tumor board solution. This article describes the development process and the enablers and barriers for adoption from a clinician’s perspective. In addition, it reflects on some of the key factors for success and some of the future opportunities.}

Controlling for gender, prior leadership positions, and leader tenure, regression modeling revealed grit and achievement values to be positively associated with affective/identity MTL, while PsyCap was positively associated with all three MTL factors. In addition, PsyCap mediated the relation between grit and all three MTL factors. Our findings suggest that PsyCap plays a critical proximal role in MTL in demanding environments, and further implications for research and practice are discussed.}

While most vendors in this space have focused on diagnostic applications, that is, viewing one or few slides at a time, some are developing solutions tailored more specifically to the various aspects of veterinary pathology including updated diagnostic, discovery, and research applications. This has especially advanced the use of digital pathology in toxicologic pathology and drug development, for primary reads as well as peer reviews.

abstract = {This article focuses on the third mission of higher education institutions (HEIs) and their role in the ecosystem of creative and cultural industries (CCIs) consisting of the innovation framework (Quadruple Helix) stakeholders. The article provides a comprehensive literature review of the role of HEIs as the knowledge-creating and engaging actor in the CCI ecosystem and place brand co-creation. The research paves the way for empirical validations of our longitudinal and multi-method research to highlight the ability of a university to implement its third mission of supporting the CCI ecosystem engagement to strengthen place branding efforts in regional development. We utilized relational access to collect extensive qualitative data, which provides an understanding of the shift of knowledge transfer processes toward an intensive engagement in economic and social development in the CCIs’ ecosystem and place brand co-creation. In conclusion, we present the role of HEIs in CCI ecosystem stakeholder engagement as one living a sustainable and inclusive place brand.}

abstract = {Background In a time of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, digital social support can prove helpful in buffering the stress and anxiety especially for students whose lives were being affected both socially and academically. The present study aims to explore the emotional and informational social support available to students during the online transformation of their education. It further investigates factors affecting anxiety and stress among students. Design and methods An online survey was administered among 479 undergraduate students at a private university in Saudi Arabia from 2nd March till 17th June 2020. Descriptive analysis was used to report the findings of students’ self-reported data. Results The results revealed that more than 70% of the students reported that they were satisfied with the informational and emotional support available to them via digital platforms. However, they felt less connected with the teachers and academic administration. Feeling sick (46%), being locked down at homes and isolation (43%) were major causes of stress and anxiety. 71% of the students reported their ability to keep themselves busy, however, only 55% of students mentioned that they did not feel lonely while confined to their homes. In these circumstances, the continuation of studies via online platforms helped students reduce stress and anxiety (52%). Conclusions Although this online transformation was not planned, the university was able to provide adequate informational support to the students. However, students were dependent upon friends, family and relatives for emotional support. The results of the study point towards the need of training for teachers and academic administrative staff in order to better address students’ needs for social support during the crisis. The results also contribute to the body of data reporting the various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students in a way to reach a sustainable framework for supporting students.}

In this way, it contributes to the literature by providing the first evaluation of productivity and its components in Vietnamese HEIs. The study uses the Färe-Primont index together with a meta-frontier approach. The research results indicate that the higher education system in Vietnam is powerfully driven by the large-scale public sector coupled with the long-term plans of Vietnamese state HEIs. Public HEIs have also been a major contributor to domestic research, and although there has been an increase in total factor productivity (TFP) throughout the research period, the private sector’s TFP was 30% higher than that of the public sector. Moreover, the higher technology gap rate (TGR) of private HEIs shows the potential for greater development in the future.}

Core objective of the 8-week massive open online course is to encourage and connect student promoters for sustainable university transformation. Its transdisciplinary learning methods encourage creation and reflexive discourse about alternative images of the future of sustainable institutions, processes and education, as well as human-nature-interaction and more-than-human futures. The integrated digital future workshop based on the participatory workshop method explores a novel approach to assess images of the future individually and collectively in digital space. This paper presents the conceptual background and methodological premises used for design and implementation of the online course as innovative method for student project development. Participants’ structured critique, utopia envisioning and specific project development provide valuable insights into the use of images of the future for higher education sustainability discourse and transformative action in student-driven sustainability projects.}

abstract = {In this paper the authors explore the implications for higher education of the disruptions caused by changes in the retail sector resulting from rapid developments in technology. Industry 4.0 technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence and virtual reality are increasingly evident in the retail sector. While predictions vary as to the extent of the disruption, retailers agree that embracing technology is now a necessity. The evidence in the paper is taken from a diverse sample of 60 senior managers across 24 retail companies in Ireland. The authors adopt a mixed-methods approach to data collection. They report that the skills required to perform in retail now and in the future will be a combination of human, digital and traditional skills. What emerges from the study is that advances in technology necessitate the provision of new hard skills, but importantly reinforce the necessity for soft skills so that the potential of the new technology can be fully understood and utilised. Helping retail employees upskill and future proof is a major challenge for higher education. Retailers need to proactively develop their employees by identifying clear progression pathways and promoting careers in retail.}

A successful use of AI depends on the attitude and perception of medical experts of its applications. Objective To evaluate physicians and medical students’ attitude and perception on AI applications in healthcare. Method A web-based survey was disseminated by email to physicians and medical students. Results A total of 293 (82 physicians and 211 medical students) individuals have participated (response rate is 27%). Seven participants (9%) reported knowing nothing about AI, while 208 (69%) were aware that it is an emerging field and would like to learn about it. Concerns about AI impact on physicians’ employability were not prominent. Instead, the majority (n=159) agreed that new positions will be created and the job market for those who embrace AI will increase. They reported willingness to adapt AI in practice if it was incorporated in international guidelines (30.5%), published in respected scientific journals (17.1%), or included in formal training (12.2%). Almost two of the three participants agreed that dedicated courses will help them to implement AI. The most commonly reported problem of AI is its inability to provide opinions in unexpected scenarios. Half of the participants think that both the manufacturer and physicians should be legally liable for medical errors occur due to AI-based decision support tools while more than one-third (36.77%) think that physicians who make the final decision should be legally liable. Senior physicians were found to be less familiar with AI and more concerned about physicians’ legal liability in case of a medical error. Conclusion Physicians and medical students showed positive attitudes and willingness to learn about AI applications in healthcare. Introducing AI learning objectives or short courses in medical curriculum would help to equip physicians with the needed skills for AI-augmented healthcare system.}

In response, controversy mapping, reverse engineering and hacking have been key methodological devices to grapple with opacity and “open the black box” of digital ecosystems. We take recent developments in digital humanitarianism and the accelerated production of apps for refugees following the 2015 Mediterranean refugee crisis as a site of methodological experimentation to advance hacking as critical methodological interference. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres, we propose to understand digital technologies as “parasitic” and reconceptualise hacking as “acts of digital parasitism”. Acts of digital parasitism are interferences that work alongside rather than work against. On one hand, this reworking of hacking advances an agenda for digital methods through reworking hacking for digital humanities and social science research. On the other, it allows us to show how the object of research – humanitarian apps – is configured through platformisation and incorporation within digital parasitic relations.}

In these digital contexts, people tend to connect with others who share their perspectives and opinions about the world. Emerging voices are warning about the growing homophily resulting from these forms of socialization, which can have a negative impact on tolerance to diversity and the quality of social capital. Relational approach disciplines such as social work can provide digital skills and competences to improve the manner in which these services are used. In this article, the authors analyse how patterns of connectedness among social work graduates affect tolerance to diversity and social capital. A sample of 126 social work graduates was analysed to assess their connectedness patterns on Facebook. Participants were also asked about their digital competences and skills in order to know how these variables can mediate the achievement of tolerance to diversity and social capital. Results show that higher connectedness, when social work graduates have digital skills on Facebook, leads to higher tolerance to diversity and social capital. In order to counteract homophily, social workers must encourage users to acquire digital skills thus increasing tolerance for diversity.}

Following the recent “history turn” in strategy and organization research, we examine the essential yet inadequately understood role of path dependence in dynamic capability building and adaptation. Precisely, we demonstrate that dynamic capabilities, as pattern-based, learned, and context-specific entities, are prone to become path-dependent under the effect of self-reinforcing mechanisms. We further show that in the face of discontinuous environmental shifts, path-dependent dynamic capabilities can—paradoxically enough—turn dysfunctional as they perpetuate current, potentially outdated ways through which a firm reconfigures its resource base. Based on this analysis, we identify ad hoc managerial action as the basis for path transformation and path dissolution, as well as path switching and new path creation, which represent complementary ways to deal with path-dependent dynamic capabilities. Our theorizing extends a contingency perspective on dynamic capabilities by shedding light on the limits and potential alternatives of pattern-based adaptation.}

As a means of taking stock of academic work’s ability to contribute to this revolution, this article tracks the changes in scholarly researchers’ perspectives on three major digital, social media, and mobile (DSMM) marketing themes from 2000 to 2015. The authors first use keyword counts from the premier general marketing journals to gain a macro-level view of the shifting importance of various DSMM topics since 2000. They then identify key themes emerging in five-year time frames during this period: (1) DSMM as a facilitator of individual expression, (2) DSMM as decision support tool, and (3) DSMM as a market intelligence source. In both academic research to date and corresponding practitioner discussion, there is much to appreciate. However, there are also several shortcomings of extant research that have limited its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and practice. Finally, in light of this, an agenda for future research based on emerging research topics is advanced.}

We set out to explore why IT professionals choose a government job to make an impact on society. We aim at disentangling the effects of different types of motives, such as extrinsic, intrinsic, and other-oriented motivational forces on the decision to accept a challenging government IT job. We use self-determination theory (SDT) to analyze publicly available statements of former private sector IT professionals reporting their reason for joining 18F. Our study is one of the first attempts to use SDT as a comprehensive framework for conducting qualitative research into work motivation in the public sector. We shed light on the conceptual and empirical distinctiveness of motives, behaviors, and perceptions of prosocial impact, which are often lumped together in the public service motivation (PSM) literature. We contribute novel empirical evidence to a nascent stream of research that uses SDT to disentangle the intrinsic, prosocial, and purely extrinsic motives that drive individuals’ decisions to join public-sector organizations.}

The literature used has a global reach; cities around the world have been chosen for comparison. By evaluating the existing literature, it has been evaluated that smart cities are the most successful and the weakest issues. Despite the centrality of New York and London’s smart city policies; they are fairly superior in economic competition. Public participation in smart city projects is already weak in Singapore and Istanbul. Barcelona has a more participatory policy than other cities, but it needs to develop a smart governance perspective. The study concludes with how the smart city ideology achieves its goals.

Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.}

State-of-art applications for transportation planning incorporating baggage services, routing, security, and safety are an evolving domain for both practitioners and researchers dealing with aviation applications. In this context, this paper seeks to answer these questions: Which standards are aimed at a smart airport to make the transportation planning sound? Which propositions are made based on the obtained prioritized standards? This study deals with standards including Environmental Effects, Docking & Navigation, Object Detection & Protection, Communications & Integration, and Terminology using a practical decision support system based on an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy inference system (FIS). Computational results reveal that the Object Detection & Protection standard has an effect on a safe and smart system. To give an overview of this standard for a smart logistics zone (SLZ), an architecture of autonomous robot units and a baggage handling system is proposed in this study. The suggested approach analyzes the obstacle photos obtained by cameras and allows the end-user to control the calculations visually. This research could provide advice to airport planners about smart policies and improving operations.}

abstract = {In this article, we explain the mechanisms that allow social enterprises to balance their missions, and the risk of mission drift as organizations grow. We empirically explore Incubator-BUS (I-BUS), a student organization within a private Brazilian university, which sought to incubate cooperatives for vulnerable groups. Although initially successful in balancing its missions, I-BUS then failed. We show how scaling-up can complicate the balancing of different missions within the same organization. We propose that, to balance their missions, social enterprises—especially recently formed and democratically managed enterprises—need not only “spaces of negotiation,” as suggested in the literature, but also “herding spaces” that connect an organization to its institutional context. We indicate why herding spaces are critical, but then show how scaling-up can result in organizational “compartmentalization” that undermines them.}

abstract = {Labour market, health, and wellbeing research provide evidence of increasing educational inequality as individuals age, representing a pattern consistent with the mechanism of cumulative (dis)advantage. However, individual life courses are embedded in cohort contexts that might alter life course differentiation processes. Thus, this study analyses cohort variations in education-specific life course patterns of subjective wellbeing (i.e. life, health and income satisfaction). Drawing upon prior work and theoretical considerations from life course theories, this study expects to find increasing educational life course inequality in younger cohorts. The empirical analysis relies on German Socio-Economic Panel data (1984–2016, v33). The results obtained from cohort-averaged random effects growth curve models confirm the cumulative (dis)advantage mechanism for educational life course inequality in subjective wellbeing. Furthermore, the results reveal substantial cohort variation in life course inequality patterns: regarding life and income satisfaction, the results indicate that the cumulative (dis)advantage mechanism does not apply to the youngest cohorts (individuals born between 1970 and 1985) under study. In contrast, the health satisfaction results suggest that educational life course inequality follows the predictions of the cumulative (dis)advantage mechanism only for individuals born after 1959. While the life course trajectories of highly educated individuals change only slightly across cohorts, the subjective wellbeing trajectories of low-educated individuals start to decline at earlier life course stages in younger cohorts, leading to increasing life course inequality over time. Thus, the overall findings of this study contribute to our understanding of whether predictions derived from sociological middle range theories are universal across societal contexts.}

abstract = {The terms decentralized organization and distributed organization are often used interchangeably, despite describing two distinct phenomena. I propose distinguishing decentralization, as the dispersion of organizational communications, from distribution, as the dispersion of organizational decision-making. Organizations can be distributed without being decentralized (and vice versa), and having multiple management layers directly affects only distribution – not decentralization. This proposed distinction has implications for understanding the growth of digital platforms (e.g. amazon.com), which dominate the global economy in the 21st century. While prominent platforms typically use machine learning as their core technology to transform inputs (e.g. data) into outputs (e.g. matchmaking services), blockchain has emerged as an alternative technological blueprint. I argue that blockchain enables platforms that are both decentralized and distributed (e.g. Bitcoin), whereas machine learning fosters centralized communications and the concentration of decision-making (e.g. Facebook Inc.). This distinction has crucial implications for antitrust policy, which, I contend, should shift both its analysis and its target of action away from the corporate level and focus instead on the data level. Based on this essay’s framework, I make several predictions regarding the future of competition between centralized and decentralized platforms, the evolution of government regulation, and broader implications for managers in the digital economy and for the business schools charged with their education. I conclude with reflections on the opportunity to revive cybernetic thinking for preventing a dystopian future dominated by a handful of platform behemoths.}

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature pertaining to such adoption and diffusion issues in order to observe trends, ascertain the current “state of play”, and to highlight promising lines of inquiry including those lacking investigative activity or simply being in need of renewed interest. Previous research activity was analysed along a number dimensions including units of analysis, research paradigms, methodologies, and methods, theories and theoretical constructs, and technologies/contexts examined. Information on these and other variables was extracted during an examination of 345 papers on innovation adoption, acceptance and diffusion appearing in 19 peer-reviewed journals between 1985 and 2007. Findings suggest that the positivist paradigm, empirical and quantitative research, the survey method and Technology Acceptance Model theory (and its associated constructs) were predominantly used in the body of work examined, revealing clear opportunities for researchers to make original contributions by making greater use of the theoretical and methodological variety available to them, and consequently reducing the risk of research in the area moving toward overall homogeneity.}

abstract = {As banks face heightened levels of regulatory challenges, many of them, especially those in developing countries, are struggling to maintain their reputations. This paper addresses the following questions: How do commercial banks in developing countries like Lebanon respond to institutional pressures for compliance concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT)? How do Regulatory Technology (RegTech) solutions contribute to solving their compliance problems in this domain and why may the potential of RegTech be limited in the Lebanese context? To answer these questions, we conducted a field study among Lebanese commercial banks and their vendors. Based on thematic analysis, findings reveal the importance of technology for enhancing compliance of Lebanese banks with international regulations, especially US ones, thereby avoiding sanctions. Thus, the adoption of RegTech is mainly due to coercive pressures, whereas the choice of RegTech solutions is highly dependent on mimetic and normative forces, and happens later. Results also show that manual processes are insufficient for compliance due to the huge number of regulations and transactions. Hence, RegTech for AML/CFT is notably adopted for the efficient screening of clients and monitoring of their transactions. These solutions enhance decision-making processes for compliance teams, which become effective when the banks ensure an adequate interaction between employees and the new technologies. However, RegTech presents several additional challenges that have to be overcome for effective compliance such as finding the right vendors and ensuring data quality. Moreover, the geopolitical context in developing countries like Lebanon limits the potential of RegTech for AML/CFT.}

Methods A scoping review was conducted according to Arksey and O’Malley (2005), and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. All English-language studies reporting on the use of home-based digital technology to support upper limb post-stroke rehabilitation were eligible for inclusion. Results The search generated a total of 1895 records, of which 76 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 52 were experimental studies and the rest, qualitative, case series and case studies. Of the overall 2149 participants, 2028 were stroke survivors with upper limb impairment. The majority of studies were aimed at developing, designing and/or assessing the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a digital system for poststroke upper limb rehabilitation in home settings. The thematic analysis found six major categories: Tele-rehabilitation (n = 29), games (n = 45), virtual reality (n = 26), sensor (n = 22), mobile technology (n = 22), and robotics (n = 8). Conclusion The digital technologies used in post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation were multimodal, and system-based comprising telerehabilitation, gamification, virtual reality, mobile technology, sensors and robotics. Furthermore, future research should focus to determine the effectiveness of these modalities.}

By comparing them to established Change Management theories, important key factors of a change process can be highlighted and the evolution of Change Management within an innovative, multinational IT service provider is shown. The Teaching Case is accompanied by in-depth Teaching Notes where we craft a synthesized checklist for thorough Change Management that addresses IT adoption issues and mitigates the critic that theoretical models are too rigid for vivid organizations. In addition to this comprehensive “360°-analysis” consisting of personal interviews, inquiries on organizational communication and research on Change Management theory, the Innovation Diffusion Theory (including a reflection of recognized technology acceptance models) is used to find explanations for possible deviations from the expected outcomes.}

It is posthumanist since i) digital cameras/audio-video resources and editing applications prompt multimodal readings of literary works unlikely from human intuition alone; ii) anthropocentrism in literary texts is defamiliarised. I highlight how stylistic analysis can be used productively for developing multimodal creativity in posthumanist reading by motivating audio-video edits and effects. I model using Anne Brontë’s poem “Home” (1846). When read only with intuition, “Home” communicates young Brontë’s yearning for her family home. In contrast, this article has a non-intuitive digital multimodal realisation of this poem where a young Californian stuck in London because of pandemic (Covid-19) travel restrictions yearns for her home state in the aftermath of wildfires linked to anthropogenic climate change. This posthumanist transformative reading, flagging the negative repercussions of humans for their planetary home, defamiliarises the poem’s anthropocentric normality. Importantly, I show how stylistic analysis of “Home” motivates creative use of audio-visual edits and effects in the posthumanist multimodal reading. The article makes contrast with standard interpretive practice in stylistics (“humanist stylistics”). It also reflects on the value of posthumanist stylistics for extending students’ creative thinking in an educational context.}

The study finds that the levels of digital finance, green finance, and ecological governance at the provincial level in China are all increasing to a certain extent. The coupling coordination degree between the three shows a development trend first rising and then falling in a transitional stage between barely coordinated and high-quality coordination, with developed regions having a higher coupling coordination degree, and less developed regions having a lower coupling coordination degree. From the dynamic correlation perspective, digital finance, green finance, and ecological governance all have a positive self-reinforcing effect, with the interaction effects being positively significant, except for the non-significant contribution of green finance to the level of digital finance and ecological governance. This study makes a series of theoretical suggestions that can optimize the transition path based on the reality of China’s green development.}

This study aimed to assess eHealth literacy among adult internet users in Lebanon, recruited through social media and printed materials. The study examined the relationship between internet use, perceived eHealth literacy, and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods A cross-sectional study based on a web-based questionnaire was conducted between January and May 2020. The survey assessed internet use and eHealth literacy using the homonymous scale (eHEALS) in English and Arabic. Cronbach’s alpha and factor analyses were used to evaluate eHEALS’ psychometric properties. A generalized linear model was used to identify factors predicting the eHEALS. Results A total of 2715 respondents were recruited mostly through Facebook (78%) and printed materials (17%). Most respondents completed the survey in English (82%), were aged 30 ± 11 years, female (60%), Lebanese (84%), unmarried (62%), employed (54%), and with a graduate-level education (53%). Those who completed the eHEALS questionnaire (n = 2336) had a moderate eHealth literacy (M = 28.7, SD = 5.5). eHEALS was significantly higher among older females with a high education level, recruited from Facebook, Instagram, or ResearchGate, and perceived the Internet as a useful and important source of information. Conclusions Future internet-delivered public health campaigns in Lebanon should account for moderate-to-low levels of eHealth literacy and find ways to engage older males with low education levels representing neglected segments (e.g. Syrians). To be more inclusive, campaigns should reach neglected population segments through non-digital, community-based outreach activities.}

abstract = {Although institutions are subject to constant change, we retain a stable image of them. Consequently, should they be considered as objects or processes? Notwithstanding its success, institutional theory still faces theoretical challenges to account simultaneously for change and stability, agency and structure. Following recent calls to integrate other perspectives on how we think about institutions, we draw on institutional analysis – a stream that has flourished in Europe and Latin America – to propose a radical and comprehensive conception of the institution as a locus of tension between the instituting (by which institutions are formed) and the instituted (temporarily stabilized forms). Since there is permanent tension between them, the institution itself can never be a stable object. It is constantly evolving, being either reinforced or destabilized. This research enriches the theoretical dialogue between organizational institutionalism and institutional analysis, two streams that have hitherto displayed little cross-fertilization. First, it contributes to rethinking the nature of institutions by emphasizing the role of the social imaginary, thus improving our understanding of the under-theorized role of imagination in institutionalization processes. Second, by placing the dynamic tension between the instituted and the instituting at the core of institutional theories, we answer calls to reclaim their missing critical dimension. Furthermore, this results in a methodological implication: the clinical approach of institutional analysis involving the intervention of researchers allows us to further embed institutional theories in organizational practice.}

abstract = {The impact of technological change on employment, inequality and job quality has attracted considerable analysis from both scholars and practitioners. However, less attention has been paid to how digital technologies are changing contemporary workplaces and how workers are responding to these changes. This article reviews recent research from the multidisciplinary comparative employment relations field, with a focus on institutional resilience or change associated with digitalization; and the strategic responses of unions and other worker representatives to these trends. We find that the insights of economists, sociologists and employment relations scholars are complementary, as each addresses a different dimension of technological change and associated worker outcomes. Comparative employment relations researchers are more likely to influence current debates where they both articulate the unique contribution of their multi-method and comparative research methods and aggregate findings beyond single or paired industry and national case studies.}

abstract = {This article extends property-owning democracy to the digital realm and introduces “data-owning democracy,” a new political economic regime characterized by the wide distribution of data as capital among citizens. Drawing on republican theory and acknowledging data’s unique role in the digital economy, it proposes a two-tier model that combines different modes of data ownership and corresponding rights. The first layer of “data-owning democracy” is characterized by a digital public infrastructure that enables citizens to collectively generate data and have a say in how their citizen data are used. In the second layer, individuals automatically receive machine-readable copies of their data whenever they are generated—a slightly more advanced form of the European Union’s existing right to data portability (Art. 20). With its focus on empowerment, data-owning democracy is designed to be complementary to existing data protection regulations. It also illustrates how political theory more broadly, and republican theory specifically, can be instructive for specifying the normative components of a new political economy dealing with questions of empowerment and digital rights.}

The United States of America (USA), in particular, plays a prominent role. The power rivalry between Washington and Beijing also affects foreign initiatives such as the DBAR. However, it remains underresearched, how the DBAR is perceived in the USA. The article fills this gap by analysing documents issued by US state bodies as well as three non-partisan think tanks between 2016 and mid-2021. Since no previous study has examined both securitised and desecuritised DBAR frames, we present a new research framework. The results show that negative perceptions of the DBAR prevail among think tanks and political elites.

This divide hinders many people from reaching their fullest potential, instead often demotivating them. Collaboration across the divide can be facilitated by semantic concepts that both sides can relate to. This article attempts to propose a new unifying concept – “work-learn balance” – that the two worlds can appreciate and use when working together. It is defined as when people on a weekly basis combine new value creation for others (“work”) and own personal development (“learn”). It was inductively articulated through action research. Extant research has shown that many people with a good work-learn balance get more motivated and feel a deeper sense of meaning in life, making them work harder and achieve more. Examples are provided from entrepreneurship, innovation, vocational education and entrepreneurial education. Work-learn balance could be used as a visionary organising principle informing leadership strategy. This could facilitate collaboration and unleash the human potential of more students and employees. Work-learn balance as a concept is novel and unexplored, but not previously unheard of. This could be the first attempt to define, describe, substantiate and sense-make it.}

We identify fundamental changes in terms of (1) what form organizational trust takes, (2) how it is produced, and (3) who needs to be trusted. First, and most broadly, trust is likely to become more impersonal and systemic. Trust between actors is increasingly substituted by trust in a system based on digital technology. Second, in terms of trust production modes, characteristic- and institution-based trust production will gain in importance. Third, despite the move toward system trust, there will nonetheless be a need to trust certain individuals; however, these trustees are no longer the counterparts to the interaction but rather third parties in charge of the technological systems and data. Thus, the focal targets of interpersonal trust are changing.}

The app serves as an ideal case for examining the socio-cultural negotiations involved in re-contextualising algorithmic technology. We conducted in-depth interviews with parents, medical practitioners and data experts in Nigeria; the interviews reveal individuals’ perceptions about algorithmic governance and self-determination. In particular, our study presents people’s insights about (1) relocated algorithms as socially dynamic “contextual settings”, (2) the (non)negotiable spaces that these algorithmic solutions potentially create and (3) the general implications of re-contextualising algorithmic governance. This article illustrates that relocated algorithmic solutions are perceived as “cosmopolitan data localisms” that extend the spatial scales and multiply localities rather than as “data glocalisation” or the indigenisation of globally distributed technology.}

Among a wide range of ubiquitous systems, smartphone applications have been increasingly developed in healthcare settings to help clinicians as well as patients. Today, many smartphone applications, from basic data analysis to advanced patient monitoring, are available to clinicians and patients. Such applications are now increasingly integrating into healthcare for clinical decision support, and therefore, concerns around accuracy, stability, and dependency of these applications are rising. In addition, lack of attention to the clinicians’ acceptability, as well as the low impact on the medical professionals’ decision making, are posing more serious issues on the acceptability of smartphone applications. This article reviews smartphone-based decision support applications, focusing on hospital care settings and their overall impact of these applications on the wider clinical workflow. Additionally, key challenges and barriers of the current ubiquitous device-based healthcare applications are identified. Finally, this article addresses current challenges, future directions, and the adoption of mobile healthcare applications.}

abstract = {Background In today’s society, people are experiencing the rapid development of digitalisation. Expecting parents may have difficulties evaluating the information online; they are not always sure which sources of information are trustworthy, and this exacerbates their feelings of anxiety. More research is needed to broaden the knowledge about how their use of digital sources may influence their health. Question The focus of this study was to explore expecting parents’ use of digital sources and how this influences their health during pregnancy. Methods A systematic review covered the thematic analysis of 39 articles. Findings The analysis resulted in the following theme: The digitalised society involves both opportunities and challenges, and expecting parents express a need for a variety of digital sources to improve their health, and sub-themes: Digital sources could promote parents’ health and well-being in a digitalised society; Consuming digital health information facilitates understanding, different feelings and social connections; and A variety of digital sources may facilitate parental identification and adaption to parenthood. Conclusion Different digital sources in our digitalised society mean access to information and opportunities to extend social connections for expecting parents. This can promote their ability to understand and adapt to parenthood, as well as to improve their health and well-being and make the parental transition. However, professional support during face-to-face consultations cannot always be exchanged to digital sources. It is important to base digital sources devoted to expecting parents and digitalisation overall on multi-sectorial collaborations and coordination between different organisations and the digital sources they provide.}

We examined the predictors of Internet use for services and its increase or decrease among a longitudinal population-based sample of 1426 older adults from Finland aged between 70 and 100 years, gathered in 2017 and 2020. High education and high income positively predicted the use of the Internet for services, and age, deteriorated health and deteriorated memory negatively. High age, low education and a change to living alone predicted a decrease in use. High education predicted the increased Internet use due to COVID-19. Thus, it seems that those older adults who have low education level are very old, whose health or memory has deteriorated and those who have changed to living alone are particularly in danger of digital exclusion. Actions targeted to these people are needed.}

Drawing on empirical data from two research projects with arts and culture workers in Australia during COVID-19 restrictions, we investigate the intersection of this promissory discourse with individual and institutional practices of digital disengagement. We contend that, rather than a panacea to lost work and income and the assurance of continued cultural consumption, digital disengagement meant that the pivot prohibited, multiplied, and negated artistic and cultural labour. By considering disengagement that was imposed upon, resourcing contingent, and that actively pushed back, this article complicates our understanding of digitalised arts and cultural labour.}

This study thus examined the extent to which e-government information quality dimensions can stimulate the acceptance and utilization of e-government services. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was used as the theoretical basis for this paper and the data congregated was evaluated with Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) statistical software using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The results have revealed that both effort expectancy and facilitating conditions significantly drive the intention to use and recommend the adoption of e-government services. Also, e-government information quality dimensions such as availability, objectivity, utility, confidentiality, and integrity were all found to positively drive the intention to use e-government services. Additionally, people’s intention to use e-government was significant in driving the recommendation behavior of e-government services to others. The practical and research repercussions of these discoveries on the development and deployment of e-government-empowered services are deliberated.}

The service provided at the library also had influence on computer and economic life, social development and issue, attitude toward computer, as well as ethical aspect. The implication found from such study results is that the citizens’ digital competence could grow with heightened quality and quantity of library services. As mentioned above, various cultural and educational programs including mutual loan service and e-book service contribute to the improvement of the citizens’ computer application, formation of positive attitude to society, and ethical awareness, as to which the nation and library should make careful development of service and program, notwithstanding investment budget in consideration of such correlation. Likewise, higher library visit rate represented high participation rate in various offline services offered by the library just as well as other online services, which can be used at the comfort of one’s home. The respective study results indicate that it is an utmost importance to seek plans to attract users to come to the library. It is critical to expand the role of library by continuously identifying people’s needs and desire for the library’s role and function, and to provide appropriate space and instrument for them to have various community activities at the library.}

However, compliance with postoperative follow-up is poor despite clear national and international guidelines. This feasibility trial aimed to evaluate the usability of a smartphone application-based follow-up program in patients after bariatric surgery. Methods Patients were included after having undergone a primary bariatric surgery. Instead of attending meetings in our outpatient clinic, they were followed up using a smartphone application. After 6 months, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to measure participant perception. Additional interviews were performed to gain more insight into the usability of the app. Results Between August 2020 and February 2021, 52 patients met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study, of whom 5 (9.6%) dropped out of the study. At the time of analysis, 31 patients have been followed up for 6 months, among whom 26 patients completed the SUS questionnaire. The mean overall score of SUS is 82.1 ± 19.8. In the qualitative analysis, participants were generally positive about the follow-up care and found it easy to use, despite some minor technical problems. Conclusion Our smartphone app-based follow-up program was proven to be effective in the aftercare succeeding bariatric surgery. Our data indicates that the satisfaction, efficiency, learnability, and ease of use of the smartphone application were coherent in the acceptance and use of mobile technology by patients.}

abstract = {There is an evolution and increasing need for the utilization of emerging cellular, molecular and in silico technologies and novel approaches for safety assessment of food, drugs, and personal care products. Convergence of these emerging technologies is also enabling rapid advances and approaches that may impact regulatory decisions and approvals. Although the development of emerging technologies may allow rapid advances in regulatory decision making, there is concern that these new technologies have not been thoroughly evaluated to determine if they are ready for regulatory application, singularly or in combinations. The magnitude of these combined technical advances may outpace the ability to assess fit for purpose and to allow routine application of these new methods for regulatory purposes. There is a need to develop strategies to evaluate the new technologies to determine which ones are ready for regulatory use. The opportunity to apply these potentially faster, more accurate, and cost-effective approaches remains an important goal to facilitate their incorporation into regulatory use. However, without a clear strategy to evaluate emerging technologies rapidly and appropriately, the value of these efforts may go unrecognized or may take longer. It is important for the regulatory science field to keep up with the research in these technically advanced areas and to understand the science behind these new approaches. The regulatory field must understand the critical quality attributes of these novel approaches and learn from each other’s experience so that workforces can be trained to prepare for emerging global regulatory challenges. Moreover, it is essential that the regulatory community must work with the technology developers to harness collective capabilities towards developing a strategy for evaluation of these new and novel assessment tools.}

abstract = {Almost 200 journalism outlets closed, decreased their service, ended print editions, or merged with other newsrooms between January 2019 and Februrary 2021, accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis. Regional news outlets were among the hardest hit, intensifying calls for effective government policy and industry interventions to bolster the sector. Although there is a well-established tradition of local and regional journalistic role performance scholarship, few studies in an Australian context have taken a multiplatform approach, investigating the perceptions of TV, radio, online news, and print journalists. To help address this gap, this paper draws on survey data of 307 regional Australian journalists and 31 in-depth interviews. Our analysis reveals differences in the way regional reporters understand and narrate their roles, highlighting important distinctions between media platforms that need to be considered in contemporary debates about the sustainability of Australian regional journalism.}

abstract = {The impacts of disasters are increasing due to climate change and unplanned urbanization. Big and open data offer considerable potential for analyzing and predicting human mobility during disaster events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to better disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning. However, the value of human mobility data and analysis (HMDA) in urban resilience research is poorly understood. This review highlights key opportunities for and challenges hindering the use of HMDA in DRR in urban planning and risk science, as well as insights from practitioners. A gap in research on HMDA for data-driven DRR planning was identified. By examining human mobility studies and their respective analytical and planning tools, this paper offers deeper insights into the challenges that must be addressed to improve the development of effective data-driven DRR planning, from data collection to implementation. In future work on HMDA, (i) the human mobility of vulnerable populations should be targeted, (ii) research should focus on disaster mitigation and prevention, (iii) analytical methods for evidence-based disaster planning should be developed, (iv) different types of data should be integrated into analyses to overcome methodological challenges, and (v) a decision-making framework should be developed for evidence-based urban planning through transdisciplinary knowledge co-production.}

Older adults are greatly underrepresented in the use of digital technology and regarded as a vulnerable group. Consequently, training programs for technological knowledge and improving technological competencies are indispensable to promote equal opportunities and health literacy. The researchers inquire what characterizes nursing informatics as an expanding field in relation to the roles and competencies of nurses in technical appropriation processes of older adults. We conducted a scoping review based on a systematic literature search. We identified 23 relevant studies and developed a modular system to characterize the potential of nursing informatics: nursing informatics as a profession, competencies of nurses and nursing informatics, assessments, and eHealth literacy. Nursing informatics is a new field in some countries, but competence profiles and role descriptions clearly show that nurses act as educators, supporters, advocates, and mediators.}

What are the psychological, relational, social and cultural impact of rapid economic development in Korea? How do these factors influence the subjective well-being, quality of life and happiness among three generations of Koreans? The first part of this article reviews the cultural history of Korea. The second part of this article reviews the rapid economic development that lifted Korea out of poverty into prosperity. The third part of this articles reviews the social and cultural changes that impacted the family, incentive structure and lifestyle of three generation of Koreans. The fourth part of this article reviews the impact of digital revolution on the psychological, economic and cultural life of Millennials and Gen Z (abbreviated as the MZ generation), and examine how they are different from their parent and grandparent generation. The fifth part of the articles reviews quality of life and social problems in Korea. In contrast to the economic prosperity that Koreans enjoy, the country is facing serious social problems with low marriage and fertility rate, high unemployment, divorce and suicide rate, and a bleak economic future for the MZ generation. The current situation in Korea is an example of Innovator’s Dilemma (Christensen, 2016), where the economic and political model that accelerated economic growth is serving as an obstacle to innovation and change. The fifth part of this article reviews empirical studies conducted in Korea during the past 20 years focusing on subjective well-being, quality of life and happiness. The results indicate that social support received from close relationships and self, relational and social efficacy predict high subjective well-being, quality of life and happiness. In contrast, income and socio-economic status had very little impact on subjective well-being, quality of life and happiness. For the MZ generation, friends have become much more important than their parents in promoting happiness and online social support is emerging as an important factor. The information, knowledge and skills that they obtain from the online community are changing how they view the world, relate to others and live. The MZ generation represents the most educated, globally connected and socially conscious generation. They are starting a quiet revolution, demanding changes to social inequalities, discrimination and climate change that were create by and for the baby boomer generation.}

Building on theories of social power and deliberate practice, the authors examine psychological effects of expert power of online travel review platforms (influencer) and its interaction effects with the power of users (influenced). Two expert platform attributes are conceptualized: specialization and experience. A significant interaction effect was identified between platform specialization, platform experience, and user power on perceived information-task fit using a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment. When users are powerful, specialization affected perceived information-task fit for low-experience platforms; no significant effect was evident for high experience platforms. When users are powerless, specialization did not affect perceived information-task fit, regardless of experience condition. Perceived information-task fit mediated the effect of specialization on intention to use. The findings contribute to power discourses by exploring the workings of expert power.}

The authors describe the M-School program at Loyola Marymount University, a program developed to address this challenge by placing digital marketing at the center of the curriculum. Through experiential learning and project-based learning, M-School courses expose students to real-life challenges involving ways in which companies and organizations generate consumer awareness, demand, and value given the significant digital shifts taking place in technology and consumer behavior. The authors highlight the creation of a digital-first curriculum that is aligned with industry practice and helps students develop the skills needed to become future proof and real-world ready. Quantitative and qualitative assessment over a three-year period points to the success of the M-School program in preparing students for careers in marketing. Lessons for the development of marketing curricula include the role of new course development, the need to integrate digital within existing courses, the role of a project-based learning approach with measurable outcomes, and the potential for designing transdisciplinary courses to foster students’ creative, critical thinking, communication, and collaborative skills.}

abstract = {The emergent “uses of the past” literature challenges traditional perspectives on history as an objective constraint for organizational action. It does so by putting forward an interpretivist view that highlights the moulding and shaping of history as a resource that enables action. We build upon and extend this approach by demonstrating how a more explicit attention to materiality reveals “the dual nature of the past” as not simply constraining and/or enabling but also actively orienting organizational action in the present. We draw upon research on organizational remembering and the concept of affordance to theorize the entanglement of organizational remembering and the material technologies of memory. We examine the dynamics of organizational remembering and materiality in the context of the British Museum’s digitization efforts. We show how narratives about the past enable organizational actors to make sense of and repurpose a novel material technology of memory (computers) through the construction of affordances. However, we also demonstrate how the materiality of objects inherited from the past also actively constrained and oriented how actors worked upon various obstacles on the path to digitization. We make two contributions. First, we develop how the dual nature of the past constitutes a novel way to reconcile deterministic and voluntarist interpretations of the past in organizations by assigning a more active role to material objects in organizational remembering. Second, we introduce a novel way to theorize organizational memory as an ongoing process of mutual constitution between technologies of memory (Speicher) and social practices of remembering (Gedächtnis).}

Shanghai’s lockdown lasted from February 28 to May 31, 2022, and was one of the strictest in China, resulting in thousands of food delivery riders being locked out of their homes, treated as potential carriers of the virus, and forced to sleep on the streets until the lockdown was lifted. The article uses qualitative research methods to explore the COVID-related homelessness of food delivery riders during the lockdown, focusing on their media practices and highlighting their experiences and agency in using mobile media to negotiate their lives amid the (im)mobile mobility they faced. It argues that mobile phones, as a transportal home, can offer a technological imaginary of home out of “homelessness”; however, they also serve as a reminder of the constraints of such an imaginary, as these (temporarily) homeless food delivery riders continue to be subject to platform exploitation and pandemic surveillance.}

At the intersection of the advertising industries and everyday media experience, we now find two connected, contending technologies, embodying different visions of automation and the future of advertising and digital media. On the industry side, there is programmatic advertising – defined broadly as the automation of the sale and delivery of digital advertising, where the appearance of advertising on a website is controlled by software rather than human decision-making. On the consumer side, there are the filtering technologies of adblocking, designed to enable users to remove unwanted ads from websites or other Internet applications. This article discusses each of these technologies, before considering the challenges raised for them by an increasingly mobile, diverse and stratified Internet.}

abstract = {Novel innovations have been witnessed in the past few years in the field of technology for autonomous vehicles. These have been exploited in various applications in the maritime domain; one such application is the proposal to develop autonomous passenger ships (APS) or ferries for carrying passengers in urban waterways. Such technology requires the integration of several components to support the safe and secure operation of the ferries. In this paper, a communication architecture is proposed, that satisfies pre-established communication requirements and supports autonomous and remotely controlled functions of an APS. The architecture was designed using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL); this enabled an iterative design process to be followed and allows for future improvements. The proposed architecture is verified by showcasing the role of the different architectural components in addressing the requirements and in supporting the expected functions in a number of operational scenarios based on the expected operations of an APS use case called “Autoferry.” Furthermore, the proposed architecture has been evaluated by demonstrating its ability to achieve the expected performance according to the requirements, in simulated experiments using the network simulator GNS3.}

Although the organizing role of platform owners is well recognized, the literature lacks a coherent approach to understanding organizational governance in the platform context. Drawing on classic organizational governance theories, this paper views digital platforms as a distinct organizational form where the mechanisms of incentive and control routinely take center stage. We systematically review research on digital platforms, categorize specific governance mechanisms related to incentive and control, and map a multitude of idiosyncratic design features studied in prior research onto these mechanisms. We further develop an integrative framework to synthesize the review and to offer novel insights into the interrelations among three building blocks: value, governance, and design. Using this framework as a guide, we discuss specific directions for future research and offer a number of illustrative questions to help advance our knowledge about digital platforms’ governance mechanisms and design features.}

Two central concerns that have emerged in this respect are that the optimized goals behind the data processing of AI applications usually remain opaque and the energy footprint of their data processing is growing quickly. This study thus explores how much people value the transparency and environmental sustainability of AI using the example of personal AI assistants. The results from a choice-based conjoint analysis with a sample of more than 1.000 respondents from Germany indicate that people hardly care about the energy efficiency of AI; and while they do value transparency through explainable AI, this added value of an application is offset by minor costs. The findings shed light on what kinds of AI people are likely to demand and have important implications for policy and regulation.}

abstract = {The article examines four models of data governance emerging in the current platform society. While major attention is currently given to the dominant model of corporate platforms collecting and economically exploiting massive amounts of personal data, other actors, such as small businesses, public bodies and civic society, take also part in data governance. The article sheds light on four models emerging from the practices of these actors: data sharing pools, data cooperatives, public data trusts and personal data sovereignty. We propose a social science-informed conceptualisation of data governance. Drawing from the notion of data infrastructure we identify the models as a function of the stakeholders’ roles, their interrelationships, articulations of value, and governance principles. Addressing the politics of data, we considered the actors’ competitive struggles for governing data. This conceptualisation brings to the forefront the power relations and multifaceted economic and social interactions within data governance models emerging in an environment mainly dominated by corporate actors. These models highlight that civic society and public bodies are key actors for democratising data governance and redistributing value produced through data. Through the discussion of the models, their underpinning principles and limitations, the article wishes to inform future investigations of socio-technical imaginaries for the governance of data, particularly now that the policy debate around data governance is very active in Europe.}

The article shows that there are remarkable differences between countries in the roles of social partners and in the combination of protective and participative mechanisms used to respond to the challenges of AI and algorithmic management. However, the analysis also serves to highlight the limits of existing institutions and practices to cope with the complexity of challenges associated with AI and algorithmic management. This calls for institutional adaptation and additional regulatory efforts at EU and national levels to support collective bargaining.}

A lack of awareness, stigma related to mental health issues, and limited accessibility to treatment services magnify the profound personal and societal impact of depression. Given the rise of smartphones in India, mobile technology can help alleviate some of these depression-related challenges. Aims and method: The aim of this paper is to investigate the essential features of an India targeted depression smartphone app. We conducted an online survey to profile the needs of individuals with depression in India, which varied based on variables such as socioeconomic background, age, level of awareness toward depression, and the extent of exposure to mental health stigma. We also conducted a systematic evaluation of depression apps currently available to Indian users to investigate the user needs that these apps met and the needs that they failed to meet. Based on our findings, we made a set of recommendations related to the essential features of a future app targeted at managing depression in India. Results: Presently available depression apps fall short in providing some significant features such as local language options, content in audio and video formats, and user location matched resources. These gaps make these apps less than fully relevant to a diverse set of Indian users. Conclusions: It is essential to provide depression-related information in a targeted manner depending upon each user’s particular needs and context. Potential customizations, such as offering content in local languages and flexible formats (e.g. audio, video, and text); and providing user-relevant diagnostic tools and location matched treatment resources can help improve the suitability of the app for diverse users.}

The findings of the full panel of fully modified ordinary least square indicates that China’s outward direct investment significantly spurs carbon emissions by (9.9%), which destroy the environment quality in the region. However, the estimated coefficients of the full panel of the fully modified ordinary least square indicates that (+) and (−) values of GDP and GDP square validate the environmental Kuznet curve hypothesis existence in the South Asia economies. Furthermore, when taking the individual countries, the environment consequences, individual characteristics of the countries and the GDP growth shows various temporal pattern of KEC hypothesis. Like in India there exist inverted U-shape curve, while Pakistan and Nepal manifest U-shape curve, whereas Bangladesh shows N-shape curve. Furthermore, this paper has identified bidirectional causality between economic growth, energy, financial development and carbon emissions. The empirical evidence implies that when governments consider foreign direct investment, they should priorities environmental protection mechanisms.}

abstract = {The village information system (VIS) is a form of e-government that villages in Indonesia have adopted. However, many village administrations still have difficulty implementing it. Gunungkidul Regency, Indonesia, is a regency where all villages have successfully adopted VIS in a sustainable manner. This study aims to portray the ecosystem that the adoption or implementation of VIS in the regency has formed. The researchers carried out data collection using observation techniques, document studies, and interviews with entities involved in the management and utilization of VIS in the regency. We used a historical approach and a stakeholder-theory lens to capture the roles and interests of each entity that comprises the ecosystem. Our findings reveal the role and interest in VIS of regional heads, several local government (or supra-village) organizations, vendors or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), village-owned enterprises (BUMDes), civil society organizations (CSO), and villagers in an ecosystem portrait. They are entities that contribute to the management and utilization of VIS. These results can provide an overview of how VIS must be managed collaboratively by involving various stakeholders. Collaborative governance is still rarely found in e-government applications in general, such as e-service, e-procurement, or e-participation, which only tend to provide general e-government roles such as automation and increasing information flow. The results of this study also offer lessons learned for other village administrations in sustainably implementing the VIS.}

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to reconceptualize the term “user.” We discuss the various activities that people engage in with digital technologies, the myriad roles they play, and an essential shift in what the term “user” means. Users might be active in shaping how a particular information system is used, they might be partners with an information system, they might be used by an information system, and they may spend sizable parts of their lives living essentially within information systems. We conclude by discussing the implications for the IS discipline of reconceptualizing the term “user.”}

Reviewing trade union strategies, this article shows which concepts of human-centred AI the trade unions are trying to promote, how they try to ensure that works councils and trade unionists get appropriate training to understand the new technologies, and how dealing with AI is changing the way works councils work.

Using an ethnographic methodology, the article analyses the case studies of drivers’ trade associations in Chile and the couriers’ organization in Spain. The results show significant similarities between the two groups: (a) non-conventional forms of labour activism; (b) using social media to share experiences, foster solidarity and organize collectively; (c) organizing in large cities; (d) starting locally and progressing to higher scales, and (e) building national and international alliances.

However, who is most affected by working with colleagues of different ages and when is being dissimilar in age from others more likely to hinder organisational identification? Drawing on relational demography and on the social identity approach, we suggest that certain individual and contextual conditions can lead employees to react to greater age dissimilarity by reducing their psychological attachment to the organisation. We propose that negative age stereotypes and perceived age-related treatment affect the salience of age as a social category for employees and threaten their age group identity, thereby creating conditions in which age dissimilarity might hinder organisational identification. We therefore examine the moderating effects of negative age stereotypes and perceived age-related treatment on the relationship between age dissimilarity and organisational identification in a sample of 434 schoolteachers from 16 schools in Italy. Findings show that age dissimilarity per se is not sufficient to hamper employees’ identification with the organisation. However, it has detrimental effects when employees hold negative age stereotypes and/or perceive an unfair organisational treatment towards their own age group. Implications for research are discussed along with practice implications.}

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation efforts in many countries as they try to contain the virus. With the physical handling of cash posing as a potential virus transmission risk, digital payments have become important in the urgent transition to a cashless society and a key feature of smart city projects. Critical analyses have typically framed smart cities as neoliberalist developmental projects that see the partnering of the state with private corporations. However, it is unclear how the smart city emerges under the technocratic inclinations of the developmental state. Focusing on the digital payments project under Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, this paper unpacks the discursive practices employed in mobilising citizen support for electronic payments through a critical analysis of publicly available government materials and recent initiatives. The discourse surrounding digital payments is bound up in narratives surrounding economic competitiveness, technological progress and public health and safety, and strongly rooted in a technocratic governance ethos that limits genuine citizen participation in shaping smart payments technologies. This paper argues that such discursive framings represent a missed opportunity to build a smart city that is truly citizen-centric. This reorientation requires more bottom-up and grassroots-based modes of governance that reformulate smart citizenship into one that pays greater attention to the affective and social contexts behind digital technologies.}

abstract = {Our article is the first attempt to investigate the association between global value chains (GVC) and environmental performance (EP). We employ two dimensions, including human health’s and ecosystem’s protection, to capture the EP, while GVC is classified backward and forward based on the foreign and domestic value-added to the total exports. By applying the formal empirical estimation procedure to a global sample of 30 low-income and lower-middle-income and 27 upper-middle-income and 33 high-income countries during the 2000 to 2018 period, some key findings are highlighted. Our estimates emphasize the importance of GVCs on EP through their influences on environmental health and ecosystem vitality. By distinguishing between the effects of different types of GVC, we reveal that being engaged in forward GVC plays a more critical role in improving the environment than backward GVC. By studying the short-run and long-run effects, our study suggests that the GVC involvement has adverse effects in the short term, but positive results appear in the long term. Notably, the investigation into the mechanism of the GVC-EP nexus provides empirical evidence to explain how being included in GVCs affects the environment and sustainability of a country. Finally, our study indicates that there are heterogenous effects of GVC on EP and these effects are conditional on a country’s income level. It is more likely that the impacts of GVC become more pronounced for high-income countries.}

abstract = {In today’s hypercompetitive business landscapes, corporate entrepreneurship (CE) plays a critical role in organizational growth and success. While the impact of CE on firm performance is widely explored in the literature, little is known to date about the contingency factors that intervene in this relationship. The purpose of this paper is to build a contextualized knowledge base to further our understanding of the CE–performance association for a sample of 307 employees from the banking sector in Pakistan. Drawing on the resource-based view, we examine how two technology-related resources—technology-based customer relationship management (CRM) and technology self-efficacy—alter the relationship between CE initiatives and performance of banks. Our study was conducted in four-time spans to capture longitudinal effects and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. Findings indicate that technology-based CRM mediates, while technology self-efficacy moderates, the CE–performance relationship. We provide several theoretical and managerial implications and suggest fruitful avenues for further inquiry in the field.}

Specifically, this study revisits the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) in the Chinese context by taking an online discussion on Weibo about a high-profile homicide in a McDonald’s restaurant as the case. Built on the framing theory and categorization of national contexts, an inductive framing analysis of 100 top forwarded posts demonstrates a complex negotiation process of context-embedded frames and its significant impacts on crisis attribution. The model of SCCT is then refined by integrating national contexts into the concept of “modifier”. Implications for both theory and practice are also discussed.}

As scholars with a long-standing interest in media industries and policies in Latin America, we start with a simple empirical observation: the curious absence of debates and strong efforts to regulate digital media in the region grounded on nationalistic arguments. It is not exaggerated to affirm that for the past two decades, the region has largely adopted a laissez-faire, deregulatory approach on fundamental issues about the structure and functioning of the Internet, including the performance of global digital platforms, content traffic, data ownership and access, and speech. We believe that understanding the decades-long transition from nationalistic media regulations to pragmatism in digital policies in Latin America yields valuable insights for theorizing the conditions that foster (and discourage) nationalism and sovereignty in digital policies.}

abstract = {This article examines the model of digital era governance (DEG) in the light of the latest-wave of data-driven technologies, such as data science methodologies and artificial intelligence (labelled here DSAI). It identifies four key top-level macro-themes through which digital changes in response to these developments may be investigated. First, the capability to store and analyse large quantities of digital data obviates the need for data “compression” that characterises Weberian-model bureaucracies, and facilitates data de-compression in data-intensive information regimes, where the capabilities of public agencies and civil society are both enhanced. Second, the increasing capability of robotic devices have expanded the range of tasks that machines extending or substituting workers’ capabilities can perform, with implications for a reshaping of state organisation. Third, DSAI technologies allow new options for partitioning state functions in ways that can maximise organisational productivity, in an “intelligent centre, devolved delivery” model within vertical policy sectors. Fourth, within each tier of government, DSAI technologies offer new possibilities for “administrative holism” - the horizontal allocation of power and functions between organisations, through state integration, common capacity and needs-based joining-up of services. Together, these four themes comprise a third wave of DEG changes, suggesting important administrative choices to be made regarding information regimes, state organisation, functional allocation and outsourcing arrangements, as well as a long-term research agenda for public administration, requiring extensive and detailed analysis.}

abstract = {Some decades on after the MacBride Many Voices, One World report (1980) and the Maitland Missing Link report (1985), global telecommunications have only gained in importance, yet are still fissured by global inequalities. This situation is evident in one of the major developments underway in recent years: 5G mobile technologies. 5G is highly significant for present and future communication—and well advanced in its deployment and adoption. However, the dominant ways in which 5G has been imagined, planned, and deployed have been significantly shaped by interests and geopolitical forces that exclude many countries, and many of the putative beneficiaries of the emergent technology. To shed light on this impasse, in this paper, we offer a comparative analysis of policy and technology realities in two distinct countries that have been relatively overlooked in 5G: Peru and Indonesia. What we find is that national policies are premised on a shared interest and shared benefits, however, at this crucial point in deployment the outcomes are remote for the majority of citizens, especially in ways that matter for daily lives. In both these countries, 5G provides benefits for the small groups who can access and afford it, with others groups in position to be able to come online in the near future—as it provides opportunities for investments, fees, and penalties. However, for large segments of the populations, 5G, the prospects of connectivity, and the emerging digital economy are a long way off.}

This paper examines the triangulation of Digital Literacy (DL), psychological well-being, and effectiveness of remote teaching and learning during the pandemic. Survey responses collected from 518 schoolteachers in Sri Lanka are analyzed with Partial Least Squares – Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. Results indicate that Remote Education (RE) has twisted a stressful life for educators. DL negatively affects the psychological well-being of the teacher. The effectiveness of teaching and learning and teacher engagement depends upon their DL level. Educators’ stress and depression status mediate the outcome of remote teaching and learning mode. Moreover, digital skills count more than the accumulated teaching experience. We emphasize the adaptive role of the teacher for sustainable digital education. The results indicate that augmented education success could be obtained by investing in digital competence. It suggests that upgrading DL is an urgent role and alarms the policymakers and education managers to mitigate the potential mental health and social capital crisis.}

Sub-optimal management of osteoporosis is an area suitable for digital health interventions. While fracture liaison services (FLSs) are proven to greatly improve care for people with osteoporosis, such services might benefit from technologies that enhance automation. The term “Digital Health” covers a variety of different tools including clinical decision support systems, electronic medical record tools, patient decision aids, patient apps, education tools, and novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Within the scope of this review are AI solutions that use algorithms within health system registries to target interventions. Clinician-targeted, patient-targeted, or system-targeted digital health interventions could be used to improve management and prevent fragility fractures. This review was commissioned by The Royal Osteoporosis Society and Bone Research Academy during the production of the 2020 Research Roadmap (https://theros.org.uk), with the intention of identifying gaps where targeted research funding could lead to improved patient health. We explore potential uses of digital technology in the general management of osteoporosis. Evidence suggests that digital technologies can support multidisciplinary teams to provide the best possible patient care based on current evidence and to support patients in self-management. However, robust randomised controlled studies are still needed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies.}

We revised the conventional consumer evaluation model by incorporating the concept of consumer empowerment to capture the consumer experience with the technology. This model was tested in a two-stage process using data collected from the consumers of clubhouses in Singapore before and after the adoption of SST. We found that structural relationships among service quality, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty were established with consistent pre- and post-adoption, and that consumer empowerment has positive effects on service quality, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. Moreover, the adoption of SST increased customer loyalty but did not increase service quality or customer satisfaction. The study’s results suggest that the focus when adopting SST should be on empowering consumers, which should also be incorporated into managing customer satisfaction.}

The history of professional indexing (from the 19th century to search engines) is used as an exemplary case for analysing the practices of this conversion. It is argued that the often hidden work of indexing constitutes a politics of invisibility and that there exists a need for strategies that help to read the hidden “personalities” of lists.}

The findings show that BRI has improved the traditional international development cooperation model in terms of emphasizing investment in developing countries, infrastructure construction, the principles of achieving shared growth through consultation and collaboration, the role of the government, and systematic and open development cooperation. At the same time, the BRI can facilitate the industrialization of developing countries by improving agricultural productivity, building infrastructure, capital formation, trade promotion, rural–urban transformation, and upgrading technology and knowledge. However, the facilitation effect depends on how developing countries formulate industrialization strategies keeping in perspective their national conditions and development needs and the international economic environment.}

These measures posed a significant challenge, because contemporary forms of Holocaust commemoration are particularly based on the personal experience of presence at museums and historical sites. In contrast to the experience of distancing in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, establishing the presence of the past is thus a crucial element of contemporary Holocaust commemoration. This article explores the relationship between presence and absence, proximity and distance, guided commemoration and online engagement by critically analyzing digital activities of Holocaust memorials and museums in response to the pandemic. It argues that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Holocaust memorials began experimenting with the potential of social media for Holocaust memory. These experiments finally accepted the ongoing generational change and reacted to significant previous shifts in media consumption that were already affecting Holocaust commemoration.}

abstract = {Digital platforms have proven to be efficient matchmakers in our networked economy and society. However, their tremendous potential is a double-edged sword, and concerns about their malpractices and negative impact have risen remarkably. In the light of practical relevance, research on digital platform regulation (DPR) did not contribute very much. Especially information systems (IS) which, as a discipline, seems predestined to explain the problems at the confluence of technology–economy–society, has barely grazed the issue of DPR. Particularly, a contribution is missing that at least explores the problems with digital platforms systematically and comprehensively. In response to this aim, we pursue a two-step approach: First, we apply qualitative meta-analysis of 211 cases as well as a number of regulation papers and actual regulation endeavors to identify and conceptualize the problem scope and potential regulatory approaches for platform problems. Second, we condense our findings into a conceptual model. Our findings show that digital platforms exploit both platform- and monopoly-related problems to assert themselves in different markets. Through their impactful platform governance, they even have become serious challengers to the regulator in controlling market access, key conditions, and resources. At this, they rely on the efficient use of data and digital technologies to effectively orchestrate platform agents and their transactions. The outcome of the paper is a set of two structured instruments that fill a void in interdisciplinary research and provide support to DPR practitioners for a systematic approach to regulation.}

abstract = {This article attempts to evaluate the library services and facilities during the pandemic situations in Pakistan. This study is fashioned in positivistic tradition of quantitative research design, and a cross-sectional research method was employed. The objective of the study was to examine the library services available to students and faculty members in two public sector academic libraries in Pakistan. A complete list of students and faculty members was collected from the concerned offices along with their WhatsApp numbers and email address. A total of 1736 students and faculty members sampled through proportionate random sampling technique and filled the questionnaire out of 7835. The inclusion criteria to participate was based on enrolled students of public and private sector university, passed at least one semester of BS (4 years) and MA/MSc (2 years) programme in Pakistan, and faculty members using library resources. A structured questionnaire to measure the response of library patrons and consisted of exogenous and endogenous variables and pretested. The study findings showed that COVID-19 pandemic situations affected educational institutions at a large scale. The social distancing rule was opted to minimise the risk of infection and university libraries were also closed down. However, due to online learning transformation, library materials were digitalized and online library services were provided to students and faculty members.}

abstract = {Basic research is the driver of advanced productivity and is an important guarantee for the market competitiveness of enterprise. In order to understand the influence of basic research on the development of China’s digital economy industry, this paper, based on structural equation model by collecting data from 209 enterprises in digital economy industry, explores the relationship between enterprise participation in basic research and four factors: enterprise efficiency, perceived risk, priority, and technological innovation, together with function mechanism. The results show that, first enterprises can improve efficiency, reduce potential risk concerns, and enhance technology level by expanding business revenue, enlarging scale, and upgrading R&D institutions, thus promoting participation in basic research. At the same time, the government can provide more subsidies for enterprise R&D funds to reduce enterprise concern about the risk of basic research, and guide them to expand their investment in R&D and focus on basic research so as to expand their participation in this field. Secondly, the optimization of enterprise participation in basic research, the upgrading of R&D institutions and the number of invention patents have mutually-reinforced effect, while the expansion of enterprise scale help to reduce the constraint of return risk to a certain extent. Finally, this paper proposes some policies and suggestions to enhance enterprise participation in basic research from the perspective of promoting industrial development and social equity.}

abstract = {Radical shifts in large information technology programmes or digital infrastructures are unusual, but they do occur, usually as a consequence of problems or misalignment. What we know less about is the role of discourse in these shifts. Our interest in this article is to investigate the role of discourse when digitalisation programmes encounter problems. Building on Foucault’s theory of discourse, our research question is: what is the role of discourse in the transformation of digital infrastructures? Our research approach is a critical realist case study, discussing three cases from eHealth innovation. We use Foucault’s archaeological methodology to identify the emerging discursive formations when a programme encounters difficulties. This enables us to analyse the causal relationship between discursive formations and other mechanisms in the infrastructure. We offer two contributions: first, we outline a framework to understand the role of discursive formations in digital transformation; second, we propose a set of configurations to explain how contextual factors and causal mechanisms contingently lead to the transformation of a digital infrastructure.}

Through a content analysis, this study examines how leading traditional news providers and trade publications, during the 2007-2010 financial shock for U.S. newspapers, covered the newspaper industry’s delicate relationship with Google. Results indicate that such coverage de-emphasized the non-advertising nature of Google News, ignored readers’ views, and used emotion-laden language (e.g., sensational accusations against Google of “stealing” newspaper content or being a “parasite”). Although Google was often portrayed as the enemy, most coverage suggested that newspapers should work with Google, pointing to the challenge of assessing Google’s role in an unfolding era of news aggregation.}

abstract = {The travel and tourism sector (TTS) is an important source of jobs and revenues for any country. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has shattered some industries more than others, with the TTS being one of the most affected ones in Romania. Recovery of TTS is, therefore, critical due to its significant share in the country’s GDP. Electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) has recently become a strong instrument that voices the experiences of customers in the online environment and further determines consumption of tourism services by other people. The choice of a tourist destination depends on a decision involving evaluations of economic, emotional, social and altruistic values attached to that destination. These evaluations can determine electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) intentions as tourists need to share their experiences. Using PLS-SEM (n=469) on the Romanian tourist population, the research hereby checks the influence of the big five personality traits (BFPT): openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism on the destination values. This research also aims to analyze the relationship between the big five personality traits and e-WOM intentions, using the mediating role of destination value, in choosing a tourist destination in Romania. Results are useful both for tourism operators and industry policy makers.}

Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of social media practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of WeChat, we identified a periodic loop of “use, non-use, reuse” of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to “re-domesticate” technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a “reboot” of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their autonomy and agency in their daily interactions with WeChat.}

However, the dissemination of these technologies in the South is rarely seen as a legitimacy issue. This paper aims to understand how the legitimacy of a new venture is created in an emerging field, considering the indeterminate and unstable nature of the entrepreneurial process. To explore this avenue, we conducted a qualitative study around a unique case: Cyberlibris, a young company operating in the field of e-books, an emerging field within the book industry in the early 2000s. This study suggests that the process of legitimation of a disruptive technology-based innovation carried out by a newcomer is constituted by a tangle of tests, a notion borrowed from pragmatic sociology, but tests change with respect to demands by African schools. First, we highlight three tests within the legitimacy process in the French context (revenue model, publisher conservatism and reading practice changes). These tests are experienced by adapting to the African context. We discuss the paradox between legitimacy and domination in technology appropriation processes.}

In the context of news, user-driven sharing is seen as vital to the success of digital journalism. While research has examined why people choose to share news online, much less is known about non-sharing—that is, why people may be reluctant to share, and what that determination suggests about the nature of news and self-presentation. We examine qualitative interview responses from a cross-section of US news consumers to investigate this question. We find that non-sharers tend to believe that news is “toxic” and potentially damaging to their reputations as well as their relationships. Not sharing news is a protective mechanism for identity maintenance, even as it brings worries about one’s voice being silenced in the process.}

The study undertaken was exploratory in nature to identify the most adopted and used technology among common public during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used descriptive statistics, R-test, R-squared test, and ANOVA for the study. The results show that video-based collaboration technology-related services had the highest adoption and usage among respondents, followed by process automation, mobile/web-based services and microservices, and artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics. As an implication of the study, businesses can focus upon technologies such as video-based collaboration technology, process automation, mobile/web-based services and microservices, and AI and analytics—in that order—to roll out new services and models while dealing with their end customers and prospects, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Thus, using the principles of natural language processing, which combines concepts of linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, helps in improving the accuracy of price determination. Therefore, this article aims to examine the relationship between sentiments conveyed through various sources and the performance of India’s largest commodity market, multi-commodity exchange (MCX). The correlation and causation between sentiment scores extracted from such textual content and the daily returns of select commodity derivatives are analysed. The results show varying levels of significance of sentiments on the returns of commodity contracts and imply that there is an increased scope of using such unstructured content in the field of finance.}

Many firms are facing a need to use these approaches to manage entities consisting of multiple projects (i.e. programs) simultaneously and efficiently. New technologies such as big data provide a huge power and rich demand for the IT application system of the commercial bank which has the characteristics of multiple sub-projects, strong inter-project correlation, and numerous project participating teams. Hence, taking the IT program management of a bank in China as a case, we explore the methods to solve the problems in multi-project concurrent development practice through integrating the ideas of program and batch management. First, to coordinate the multi-project development process, this paper presents the batch-based agile program management approach that synthesizes concurrent engineering with agile methods. And we compare the application of batch management between software development projects and manufacturing process. Further, we analyze the concurrent multi-project development practice in the batch-based agile program management, including the overlapping between stages, individual project’s activities, and multiple projects based on common resources and environment to stimulate the knowledge transfer. Third, to facilitate the communication and coordination of batch-based program management, we present the double-level responsibility organizational structure of batch management.}

We propose the concept of conversation as a way of theorizing a constructed sociality via which creative firms manage this conflict; we also propose the concept of ensemble as a way of theorizing a conversationally nurtured but fragile form of intensified sociality that most successfully combines conflicting influences when it can be achieved. Together, these theoretical conceptualizations contribute new insights and help organize a fragmented landscape of ideas about work in creative firms.}

Findings show that the inflated visibility of anti-governmental opinions in the manipulated comment space was incongruent with the overall political tone that general users had spontaneously encountered from the broader media ecosystem beyond the manipulated space. Subsequently, this opinion “climate” incongruence decreased the likelihood of commenting in the manipulated space.

Recently, a new generation of entrepreneurs seized this emerging market opportunity by positioning themselves as service providers for free/open source software users. Conceptualizing such providers as “institutional entrepreneurs,” we find that due to the nature of the free/open source software context, they exhibit a different set of legitimation actions compared with similar efforts in other contexts. Based on our empirical analysis of free/open source software service providers and drawing on prior theory, we identify two entrepreneurial actions aimed at gaining legitimacy specific to the free/open source software context, namely, product-based theorization actions and evangelization actions. We also demonstrate that institutional entrepreneurship is shaped by the nature of free/open source software products and the openness values at the core of the free/open source software movement. Our work hence underscores the importance of the context of institutional entrepreneurship.}

This concept articulates historically-contingent institutional conditions that facilitate corporate strategies to reorganize the workplace and union resistance practices. This article contributes an original relational framework to understand what is distinct about workplace reorganization at a particular setting. It considers workplace actors’ heterogeneous resistance practices within a specific workplace context and how communication practices express and constitute resistance.

This article provides an exploratory analysis of the experience of police leaders who are responsible for delivering transformational and enduring change, through data collected during a recent study in an urban English police force. The findings show that although positive steps are being taken to improve the way in which change activity is managed and implemented, there is still some way to go. A disconnect was identified between those who are leading change within the headquarters function and their capability to do so. The need to “lead for today” while also “leading for tomorrow” is identified as a key tension at executive level. The article tests the hypotheses that leading change is a specialism of police leadership that should be recognised as such. Implementing the role of the “Police Change Manager” is proposed as the approach by which a more capable and successful change function might be established. The article concludes with recommendations for maturing the approach to change in policing and proposes opportunities for further research.}

abstract = {Objectives Electronic health records (EHRs) are considered important for improving efficiency and reducing costs of a healthcare system. However, the adoption of EHR systems differs among countries and so does the way the decision to participate in EHRs is presented. Nudging is a concept that deals with influencing human behaviour within the research stream of behavioural economics. In this paper, we focus on the effects of the choice architecture on the decision for the adoption of national EHRs. Our study aims to link influences on human behaviour through nudging with the adoption of EHRs to investigate how choice architects can facilitate the adoption of national information systems. Methods We employ a qualitative explorative research design, namely the case study method. Using theoretical sampling, we selected four cases (i.e., countries) for our study: Estonia, Austria, the Netherlands, and Germany. We collected and analyzed data from various primary and secondary sources: ethnographic observation, interviews, scientific papers, homepages, press releases, newspaper articles, technical specifications, publications from governmental bodies, and formal studies. Results The findings from our European case studies show that designing for EHR adoption should encompass choice architecture elements (i.e., defaults), technical elements (i.e., choice granularity and access transparency), and institutional elements (i.e., regulations for data protection, information campaigns, and financial incentives) in combination. Conclusions Our findings provide insights on the design of the adoption environments of large-scale, national EHR systems. Future research could estimate the magnitude of effects of the determinants.}

abstract = {Can organizational culture be intentionally changed? And if so, what are the pathways to success versus failure? We address these questions by employing a configurational perspective, which allows us to examine the impact of multiple combinations of employee perceptions and traits on planned organizational culture change. Although employees have long been the focus of culture change research, the complex interactions of factors affecting their reactions have been largely ignored. With such a focus, the study empirically identifies pathways to successful versus failed organizational culture change, drawing rare empirical evidence from 59 interviews and secondary data from one of the longest surviving examples of industrial democracy, John Lewis Partnership, which underwent change geared away from a “civil-service” towards a high-performance culture. Applying a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we identify multiple equifinal combinations of employee perceptions and traits (e.g., perceived organizational support, empowerment, and tenure) associated with successful or failed organizational culture change. Interestingly, we find more pathways leading to positive (i.e., “comparing”, “acquitting”, and “tolerating”) versus negative (i.e., “disillusioning” and “dissociating”) reactions to culture change. We leverage these findings to show that employee reactions are more complex than currently considered, illustrating the value of a configurational perspective in such efforts.}

In this study we shed light on an unintended but highly consequential effect of sharing preprints: Their contribution to conspiracy theories. Although the scientific community might quickly dismiss a preprint as insubstantial and “clickbaity”, its uncertain epistemic status nevertheless allows conspiracy theorists to mobilize the text as scientific support for their own narratives. To better understand the epistemic politics of preprints on social media platforms, we studied the case of a biomedical preprint, which was shared widely and discussed controversially on Twitter in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Using a combination of social network analysis and qualitative content analysis, we compared the structures of engagement with the preprint and the discursive practices of scientists and conspiracy theorists. We found that despite substantial engagement, scientists were unable to dampen the conspiracy theorists’ enthusiasm for the preprint. We further found that members from both groups not only tried to reduce the preprint’s epistemic uncertainty but sometimes deliberately maintained it. The maintenance of epistemic uncertainty helped conspiracy theorists to reinforce their group’s identity as skeptics and allowed scientists to express concerns with the state of their profession. Our study contributes to research on the intricate relations between scientific knowledge and conspiracy theories online, as well as the role of social media platforms for new genres of scholarly communication.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence is already embedded in several digital tools used across design disciplines. Although it offers advantages in automating and facilitating design tasks, this technology has constraints to empowering practitioners. AI systems steadily incorporate machine learning to deliver meaningful designs but fail in critical dimensions such as creativity. Moreover, the intensive use of AI features to provide a design solution – so-called AI design – challenges the boundaries of the design field and designers’ roles. AI-powered logo makers exemplify a horizon where non-designers can access design tools to create a personal or business visual identity. However, in the current context, these online businesses are limited to randomize layout solutions lacking the visual properties a logo requires. This article reports mixed-method research focusing on AI-powered logo makers’ processes and outcomes. We investigated their capability to deliver consistent logo designs and to what extent their algorithms address logo design principles. Initially, our study identified representative visual principles in logo design-related literature. After probing AI-powered logo makers’ features that enable logo creation, we conducted an exploratory experiment to obtain solutions. Finally, we invited logo design experts to evaluate whether three visual principles (proportion, balance and unity) were incorporated into the layouts. The assessment’s results suggest that these AI design tools must calibrate the algorithms to provide solutions that meet expected logo design standards. Even focusing on a particular AI tool and a few visual principles, our research contributes to initial directions for developing algorithms that embody the complex aspects of visual design syntax.}

To overcome the problem, the cost-efficiency-carbon emission competition model is proposed to solve the scheduling optimization for the AGVs in ship panel block construction workshop. Firstly, the logistics path plan of the panel block construction workshop is obtained by establishing the path-planning node map of panel block construction workplace. Secondly, a scheduling model for AGVs is constructed based on the competition mechanism of the lowest transportation cost, maximum transportation efficiency, and lowest carbon emission. Then, the optimized schedule is achieved by a novel hybrid method of the genetic and population migration algorithm considering the competition mechanism. Finally, the case validation indicates that the solving ability of the proposed hybrid method is improved by 52.4% compared with Genetic Algorithm under competitive mechanism. Besides, the results demonstrate material transportation time can be reduced by 17.5%.}

abstract = {Many manufacturing companies are always looking for a way to reduce energy consumption by utilizing energy-efficient production methods. These methods can be different depending on the type of products and production technology. For instance, one of the ways to increase energy efficiency and keep the precision of production is to use robots for the transportation of the parts among the machines and loading/unloading the machines. This technology is affordable compared to the technologies used in manufacturing companies. Manufacturing companies that rely on robotics technology must have a strategy to reduce energy costs and at the same time increase production by adjusting the intensity of processing or controlling the production rate. This study presents an exact solution method for flexible robotic cells to control the production rate and minimize energy consumption, which aims to both reduce electricity prices and minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under a lead time of production. Then, considering the NP-hardens nature of the problem, a heuristic solution method based on the genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Using the proposed approach, manufacturing companies will be able to make more accurate decisions about processing intensity and process scheduling while ensuring sustainability.}

Prisoner re-entry is a critical piece of any racial justice agenda as the lack of education or vocational training within carcer institutions impose barriers to job opportunities that, coupled with societal stigmas, often make reintegration extremely challenging. Noting that changes in policies with significant potential to improve reentry outcomes extend beyond federal agencies traditionally involved in the administration of justice, we include ways to reduce reentry barriers such as housing, education, employment, health, and political rights. The paper is divided into short, medium and long-term recommendations. The short-term recommendations pertain to existing funding streams and discretionary authority regarding administrative rules and regulations, funding decisions, and rule enforcement. Medium-term recommendations involve the creation of new legislation, infrastructure, and funding appropriations. In the long-term, recommendations include changes in laws to achieve fundamental re-orientations of existing policy frameworks, and approaches that require substantial new funding appropriations.}

This study aimed to assess subclinical neurophysiological alterations in welding workers. They were employed in a machine building factory with an average Mn exposure <200 mg/m3. Sixty-eight welding workers (mean age: 34 years; mean Mn exposure duration: 16 years) and 42 flour factory workers (control group) with similar age and smoking habit were recruited. Autonomic nervous function test battery (ANSFT), composed of Valsalva maneuvre-induced heart rate variation (HR-V), heart rate variation following deep breathing (HR-DB) and heart rate variation following immediate standing up (HR-IS) was assessed. Electroencephalogram (EEG), brain electricity activity mapping (BEAM) were also performed. HR-V, HR-DB and HR-IS were significantly lower in Mn- exposed subjects showing altered autonomic nervous system activity, parasympathetic-sympathetic imbalance and, consequently, altered cardiovascular regulation and reactivity. The EEG of the Mn-exposed workers evidenced β-wave rhythms significantly reduced, Θ-waves markedly increased and abnormal wave activities of either localized or diffusive type. In the same workers, BEAM revealed higher Θ, δ and β power values in the F7 area, lower d power values in the FP1, FP2 and C4 areas as well as dissymmetry in the central area, parietal region and occipital region. This study suggests that Mn impairs neuron activity within central nervous system. In this context, brainstem parasympathetic and sympathetic centers, receiving axon projections from cortical and diencephalic areas, may reflect Mn effects on upper pathways. However, direct actions of Mn on these centers cannot be excluded.}

abstract = {The meanings of being “underclass” in China are increasingly ambivalent when various disadvantaged social groups also get access to digital platforms which become more and more influential in not just facilitating people’s economic and cultural practices online but also mediating, distorting, and reshaping these processes. Using critical techno-cultural discourse analysis about how the underclass represent poverty and themselves by creating short videos and performing live-commerce on Kuaishou, this study finds that digital entrepreneurialism becomes an interlocking governmentality to discipline the underclass’ online participation. Afforded by the platform and operationalized by multiple networked actors, entrepreneurialism incorporates the underclass in the digitally mediated productive relationship and at the same time disciplines their online representation and exploits the involved entities through both platform labor and monetary investments to cultivate an underclass entrepreneurial subject. Although claiming to include and empower the diversified Chinese underclass, digital platforms actually reproduce the underclassness by mobilizing the calculated conformity among the underclass to experience the intertwining online and offline inequalities through digital entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, nuances of minor narratives still exist in the digitally mediated self-representation.}

Medicine is a major field predicted to increase the use of big data in 2025. Big data in medicine may be used by commercial, academic, government, and public sectors. It includes biologic, biometric, and electronic health data. Examples of biologic data include biobanks; biometric data may have individual wellness data from devices; electronic health data include the medical record; and other data demographics and images. Big data has also contributed to the changes in the research methodology. Changes in the clinical research paradigm has been fueled by large-scale biological data harvesting (biobanks), which is developed, analyzed, and managed by cheaper computing technology (big data), supported by greater flexibility in study design (real-world data) and the relationships between industry, government regulators, and academics. Cultural changes along with easy access to information via the Internet facilitate ease of participation by more people. Current needs demand quick answers which may be supplied by big data, biobanks, and changes in flexibility in study design. Big data can reveal health patterns, and promises to provide solutions that have previously been out of society’s grasp; however, the murkiness of international laws, questions of data ownership, public ignorance, and privacy and security concerns are slowing down the progress that could otherwise be achieved by the use of big data. The goal of this descriptive review is to create awareness of the ramifications for big data and to encourage readers that this trend is positive and will likely lead to better clinical solutions, but, caution must be exercised to reduce harm.}

Existing papers mainly focus on digital financial inclusion’s influence. Based on China’s data, this paper fills the gap by constructing an index system to measure traditional financial inclusion and discussing the impact mechanism of the two kinds of financial inclusion on enterprise innovation (output and efficiency). The results illustrate that traditional financial inclusion inhibits the innovation output of enterprises, while digital financial inclusion has a positive effect. However, both traditional and digital financial inclusion is still in the stage of constraining the innovation efficiency of enterprises. Moreover, the two types of financial inclusion function differently for enterprises of different sizes and ownership. Evidence from China is expected to reveal the features of this relationship and inspire research in more economies.}

We start with Joss et al.’s observation that the smart-city discourse is presently in flux, engaged in intensive boundary-work and struggling to gain wider support. We approach this process from the critical perspective of surveillance capitalism, as proposed by Zuboff, to highlight the growing privacy concerns related to technological development. Our results are based on analysing 184 articles regarding smart-city solutions, published on social media by five European journals between 2017 and 2021. We adopted both human and machine coding processes for qualitative and quantitative analysis of our data. As a result, we identified the main actors and four dominant narratives: regulation of artificial intelligence and facial recognition, technological fight with the climate emergency, contact tracing apps and the potential of 5G technology to boost the digitalisation processes. Our analysis shows the growing number of positive narratives underlining the importance of technology in fighting the pandemic and mitigating the climate emergency, but the latter is often mentioned in a tokenistic fashion. Right to privacy considerations are central for two out of four discovered topics. We found that the main rationale for the development of surveillance technologies relates to the competitiveness of the EU in the global technological rivalry, while ambitions like increasing societal well-being or safeguarding the transparency of new policies are nearly non-existent.}

The aim is to contribute to a critical discussion of the potential implications of allowing major commercial players to take the lead in the development of digital infrastructure in education. Guiding the analysis is the notion of “problem” understood as central for Google for Education’s success story. The case of Sweden, in which Google for Education has become widely used, forms the vantage point for this discussion. The study makes visible how Google for Education, in the commercial rhetoric, is constructed as the solution to problem representations by being positioned as a much-needed bridge, in the shape of digital information infrastructure, between digital policy and educational practice. However, Google for Education is far from simply a practical solution to a set of expensive and urgent problems. To uncritically embrace Google as the information infrastructure of education is to hand over power to one actor, which closes doors to alternative paths of doing and knowing in education.}

abstract = {Digitalization has the potential to disrupt many service industries. This is already evident in industries offering standardized business-to-consumer services. Even knowledge-intensive business-to-business (B2B) services have increasingly blended digital technologies. Yet, little is known about how this type of service and its associated service work has changed, as tasks are being increasingly performed by robots or through artificial intelligence. This study fills this void by exploring how frontline workers in two highly knowledge-intensive B2B service industries—auditing and public relations/communication (PR/C) consulting—enact their service work in response to digitalization. Building on an interview study with 50 professionals and taking an interdisciplinary stance we find—contrary to the findings in previous research—that auditing firms embrace digitalization to a larger extent than PR/C firms. Further, we find that the frontline workers’ enactment of their service work is influenced by the fit between technological innovations and the type of intelligence their services are built on, as well as their occupational identities and the service climate within the firms. We conclude the article by developing propositions and a conceptual model, and outline how service firms can support their frontline workers’ infusion of digital technologies in their service work.}

abstract = {Background Many seniors need to increase their physical activity (PA) and participation in fall prevention exercise. Therefore, digital systems have been developed to support fall-preventive PA. Most of them lack video coaching and PA monitoring, two functionalities that may be relevant for increasing PA. Objective To develop a prototype of a system to support seniors’ fall-preventive PA, which includes also video coaching and PA monitoring, and to evaluate its feasibility and user experience. Methods A system prototype was conceived by integrating applications for step-monitoring, behavioural change support, personal calendar, video-coaching and a cloud service for data management and co-ordination. Its feasibility and user experience were evaluated in three consecutive test periods combined with technical development. In total, 11 seniors tested the system at home for four weeks with video coaching from health care professionals. Results Initially, the system’s feasibility was non-satisfactory due to insufficient stability and usability. However, most problems could be addressed and amended. In the third (last) test period, both seniors and coaches experienced the system prototype to be fun, flexible and awareness-raising. Interestingly, the video coaching which made the system unique compared to similar systems was highly appreciated. Nonetheless, even the users in the last test period highlighted issues due to insufficient usability, stability and flexibility. Further improvements in these areas are needed. Conclusions Video coaching in fall-preventive PA can be valuable for both seniors and health care professionals. High reliability, usability and flexibility of systems supporting seniors are essential.}

This is because sound records management is fundamental for good governance and effective and efficient administration of government units. This article analyses records management trends at Statistics South Africa (StatsSA). Qualitative desktop research was used with key legislative and policy sources, StatsSA documents and international literature. The study revealed that numerous challenges existed in the organisation’s records management. These challenges include: creation of the record retention and disposal authority granted by the Archivist; stakeholder relations and engagement; compliance with the National Archives and Records Services of South Africa (NARSSA) Act No. 43 of 1996 as the primary legislation for records and archives management in South Africa; and digitalization and transformation. The article recommends that the resource centre be digitalized by adopting the Millennium and Sierra Integrated Library Systems software for records management, skills development archiving and enhanced stakeholder relations. An effective and efficient records and archives management system promotes good governance, accountability, and transparency.}

Our paper uses the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to investigate the causal relationships among the supply network complexity, geographic dispersion, inventory turns, and firm performance. Using a sample of 263 Chinese listed firms, we find that no single factor is necessary to achieve high firm performance during COVID-19 and reveal four paths to produce high performance: operational level driven, supply base complexity driven, and customer base complexity driven with supplier distance, and supply network complexity absence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that supply-based complexity-driven and customer-based complexity-driven can improve firm performance, but not all supply network complexity dimensions can improve firm performance. Hence, firms need to choose the suitable path based on their specific situations.}

In this paper, the author discusses the role of technology in the EGD through the lens of technological determinism. It is argued that, in many ways, the EGD overestimates the importance of technology, especially new technology. Unlike typical technological determinist views, the EGD recognises the importance of human agency. However, the success of human and social agency as drivers change in this project depends on preferences of actors involved in this green transition, including technological preferences. The author argues that the source of these biases lies with the economic policy foundations of the EGD which lead to prioritising economic interest over environmental needs. The article suggests that greater reliance on environmental regulation may restore the appropriate balance between economy and environment, and between the belief in the power of new technology and people’s responsibility for the environmental and other consequences of technology production and use, and thus improve the prospects of the EGD in its environmental and sustainability aspirations.}

While much of the literature acknowledges that the fundamental restructuring coupled with technical capacity that these joint projects require leads to increased complexity, little is known about how different types of complexity interact within the collaborative process. Using established concepts of substantive, strategic, and institutional complexity, we apply complexity theory in collaborative digital environments. To do so, eight digital projects are analysed that differ by state structure and government level. Using a cross-case design with 50 semi-structured expert interviews, we find that each digitalisation project exhibits all types of complexity and that these complexities overlap. However, clear differences emerge between national and local level projects, suggesting that complexity in digitalisation processes presents different challenges for collaborative digitalisation projects across contexts.}

The second model institutionalizes digital information and communication technology (ICT) within the rational-bureacratic framework of existing governance. The third model is based upon a reconceptualization of democratic representation, based upon new notions of accountability, plurality and authentic reality. It is argued that virtual deliberation and indirect representation are under severe political strain and that digitally-mediated direct representation could provide a basis for a more dialogical and deliberative democracy in place of the dialogue of the deaf which tends to characterize contemporary political representation.}

abstract = {This study examines major challenges for the Korean economy since East Asia has undergone significant transitions with the emergence of China in the 2000s. Because the transition has created uncertainties in the economy, South Korea has been exposed to a high degree of international competition in the turbulence of regional integration. We first employed structural vector autoregression to provide the impulse response of investment to various economic shocks, revealing the effects of structural changes and competition on industry. Furthermore, we identified the reasons behind low investment in South Korea over the past two decades. Second, as a proxy for structural change in the economy, we addressed the effects of extraneous shocks on the Korean economy by considering industry competitiveness. The results indicate that heightened uncertainty and export demands have shaped the dynamics of the Korean economy. In particular, the overall competitiveness of South Korea’s merchant trade in major products such as mobile phones, automobiles, ships and optics has weakened due to intensifying competition and increasing overseas production. These changes suggest that South Korea needs to revise its economic development strategy, which has been largely driven by exports. To address the diverse challenges faced by the Korean economy, we highlighted the importance of indigenous dynamism for sustainable growth.}

abstract = {This article proposes a conceptual framework of how the United States is reinventing colonialism in the Global South through the domination of digital technology. Using South Africa as a case study, it argues that US multinationals exercise imperial control at the architecture level of the digital ecosystem: software, hardware and network connectivity, which then gives rise to related forms of domination. The monopoly power of multinational corporations is used for resource extraction through rent and surveillance – economic domination. By controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct power over political, economic and cultural domains of life – imperial control. The centrepiece of surveillance capitalism, Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates economic power in the hands of US corporations – a system of global surveillance capitalism. As a feature of surveillance capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted surveillance in the Global South – which intensifies imperial state surveillance. US elites have persuaded people that society must proceed according to its ruling class conceptions of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech hegemony. The author argues for a different ecosystem that decentralises technology by placing control directly into the hands of the people to counter the rapidly advancing frontier of digital empire.}

Therefore, this paper attempts to discuss the following matters: the definition of “database grammatology”; the relationship between “database grammatology” and “corpus linguistics”; the feasibility of “database grammatology”; “database grammatology” and traditional grammatology; the database construction of “database grammatology”; and the academic quality pursuit of database grammatology study.}

In tacking stock of the geographical digital divide, I combine findings and vignettes from my published research with the insights of other authors and data from the Australian Digital Inclusion Index. I make observations about the evolution of geographical digital inclusion in Australia focused on three themes: incremental digital development; the complexity and cost of getting connected; and compounding factors of disadvantage.

Based on interviews and archival documents, we find, first, that existing laws exert agency in the market-building process not only through abstract legal “traditions” but through technical features which may resist the market arrangements proposed by political-economic coalitions. Second, the resistance of law can vary based on whether its spokespersons (guardians of legal consistency) become “market engineers” under specific organizational configurations. We theorize this agency with the concept of “legal infrastructure”, and show how it acts as a non-human organizer of markets, ensuring compatibility across the economy.}

The complexity of these practices requires a relevant holistic approach, able to take into account the multiplicity of contexts of use, the multiplicity of interactions and media or tools used, and able to encompass both what is directly visible and what is implicit (Leander and McKim, 2003). Transliteracy, originally defined by Sue Thomas and colleagues as “the ability to read, write and interact across a range of platforms, tools and media from signing and orality through handwriting, print, TV, radio and films, to digital social networks” (Thomas et al., 2007), seems interesting in this respect and is the basis of our investigation and analysis. The work described here proceeds from a programme funded by the French national research agency (ANR Translit 2013–2016) focusing on the possible faces of transliteracy in action, on how high-school students (15–16 years old) manage information individually and collectively, with all the media and tools available nowadays, and academic requirements and support. The ethnographic methodology included observations of learning situations carried out between November 2013 and March 2015 (two classes of around 30 pupils each and four teachers involved).}

Taking the case study of India’s “national champion” Reliance Jio, this article considers the ways in which India’s leading “corporate” has deployed the “ecosystem” blueprint and adopted the strategic role of the oligopolistic megacorp in India’s digital economy. It has done so, seemingly, without adopting the institutional form upon which Eichner’s founding proposition rests. Consequently, we argue that the separation of ownership and management as per the North American corporate form is not fundamental to the status, function or strategy of a conglomerate oligopoly. Rather, we propose that the megacorps of the digital age have an arisen as an inevitable consequence of market hierarchies in the digital economy, and that the key institutional factor in the consolidation of their market power is the licence of the state.}

However, algorithmic decision-making is often non-transparent and rapidly evolving, forcing workers to constantly adapt their behavior. Extant research focuses on how workers experience algorithmic management, while often disregarding the agency that workers exert in dealing with algorithmic management. Following a sociomateriality perspective, we investigate the practices that workers develop to comply with (assumed) mechanisms of algorithmic management on digital work platforms. Based on a systematic content analysis of 12,294 scraped comments from an online community of digital freelancers, we show how workers adopt direct and indirect “anticipatory compliance practices”, such as undervaluing their own work, staying under the radar, curtailing their outreach to clients and keeping emotions in check, in order to ensure their continued participation on the platform, which takes on the role of a shadow employer. Our study contributes to research on algorithmic management by (1) showing how workers adopt practices aimed at “pacifying” the platform algorithm; (2) outlining how workers engage in extra work; (3) showing how workers co-construct the power of algorithms through their anticipatory compliance practices.}

abstract = {Following the highly pervasive and effective use of agile methods at the team level, many software organisations now wish to replicate this success at the organisational level, adopting large-scale agile methods. However, an analysis of extant literature reveals (i) a lack of theoretically grounded studies of large-scale agile transformations; (ii) weak assumptions underpinning those that do exist; and (iii) an overly simplistic and often problematic over-reliance on simple adherence to agile methods. In addition, there is a lack of insights on why large-scale agile transformations fail. To explore this, we apply normalisation process theory (NPT) to examine key challenges in normalising (i.e. the process of embedding and sustaining) large-scale agile methods. We present an in-depth case study of large-scale agile transformation and demonstrate how failing to normalise a large-scale agile method can unravel an organisation’s transformation efforts. There are four key contributions from this research. First, this study shows that the standard focus on initial adoption is one of the main reasons for the widespread failure of digital transformations and in this case a large-scale agile transformation. Second, this is the first study to introduce and empirically apply NPT to information system development (ISD) as an illustrative guide for those across information systems field to follow. Third, we present key recommendations based on NPT to guide researchers and practitioners on the normalisation of large-scale transformations. Fourth, we present an agenda for future research on large-scale agile transformations.}

abstract = {Based on participant observations in the French and German public employment services (PES), this article proposes a new way of analysing bureaucratic encounters following Bourdieu’s capital theory. We show that caseworkers who are supposed to support jobseekers into employment, force the allegedly needy jobseekers to accumulate capital, but only in its cultural or social form, and never both at the same time. While there are national differences in the accumulation process, the findings highlight the coexistence of two different strategies: accumulation of cultural capital for a long-term and stable return to employment or accumulation of social capital for a short-term and temporary access to employment. Caseworkers attribute different importance to each type of capital, which results in an uneven distribution that reproduces inequalities through social policy services.}

First, this study compares the impact of musical elements (tempo and style) with two subjective variables (musical likeability and congruency). Second, affective influence (likeability) and cognitive influence (congruency) of music are discussed. The empirical findings reported provide evidence that subjective variables are more influential than musical structure. Moreover, the results suggest that music can act simultaneously in affective and cognitive ways. In this situation, the type of involvement (affective or cognitive) is shown as moderating the relative strength of the impact of musical likeability and congruency on advertising responses.}

In incentivized experiments, we find that nonprofessional investors divest from companies with a negative sustainability-related incident, and that symbolic legitimation (which only evasively explains a negative incident) is not a strong enough signal to counter this divestment behavior. Even substantial legitimation (which reports on measures and behavioral change) mitigates the divestment decisions only if the company reports on concrete remediation actions in morally charged situations, such as social or environmental incidents. We elaborate these results in light of signaling and screening theory, and suggest the conceptual extension of “costly signals” to what we call “valuable signals.” We argue that valuable signals need be not only costly for the sender from an economic perspective but also perceived as appropriate by the receiver from a noneconomic perspective.}

Participants were shown a video of a “mock” remote home visit and asked to discuss the potential benefits, barriers and uses they could envisage. Methods Purposive sampling brought together stakeholders, patients and public representatives to capture thoughts, feelings and views in co-design workshops. Primary qualitative data were collected in real time. Post workshop, they were analysed and categorised into key themes and subthemes. Findings The opportunity to conduct remote home visits was regarded as a positive adjunct to usual practice. However, concerns about the quality of remote assessments were expressed by participants in the workshops. Conclusion The NHS response to COVID-19 sparked a national roll out of the use of video conferencing technology. The opportunity to access technology to conduct remote visits and consultations, has instigated a seismic change in the way healthcare is delivered now and for the future. However, there is much we do not yet know about the impact on the intended adopters and users of remote visits and consultations. This study demonstrated the importance of involving intended adopters and users in the co-design of technology to explore potential benefits, barriers and uses providing valuable insights to inform future design and development.}

abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been implemented across all levels of education, with the rapid developments of chatbots and AI language models, like ChatGPT, demonstrating the urgent need to conceptualize the key debates and their implications for a new era of learning and assessment. This adoption occurs in a context where AI is dramatically remapping “the human,” the purposes of schooling, and pedagogy. Focus of Study: The paper examines how different formulations of “human” became interwoven with the sliding signifier of “intelligence” through a series of violent exclusions, and how the shifting contour of “intelligence” produces uneven and unjust ontological scales undergirding both education and AI fields. Its purpose is to engage the education research community in dialogue about biases, the nature of ethics, and decision-making concerning AI in education. Research Design: This paper adapts a historical-philosophical method. It traces the effects of colonialism and racialization within humanism’s emergence through Sylvia Wynter’s historiography of “figure of Man,” especially via the invention of “intelligence,” which has linked education and computer science. It also investigates themes central to modern education such as justice, equity, and in/exclusion through a philosophical examination of the ontological scales of “human.” Conclusions: After outlining how “intelligence” has shifted from reason-as-morality to concepts of natural intelligence, we argue that current examples of AI in Education (AIEd), like classroom chatbots and social agents, constitute an intermediary point in the arc toward a new computational superintelligence—the emergence of man3—illustrating the opportunities, risks, and ethical issues in pedagogical applications based on emotion. We outline three differing visions of AIEd’s future, concluding with a series of provocations (onto-epistemological, practice-based, and purposes of schooling) that exceed such models and that, given rapid innovations in machine learning, require urgent consideration from multiple stakeholders.}

Accordingly, companies developing, providing, and maintaining game engines—such as Epic Games or Unity Technologies—are set to become influential actors in all social and economic arenas that start to rely on game engines for the provision of software or services. This makes them an important subject to the study of platforms as they provide increasingly crucial building blocks in the digitization of economic, political, and social life. In this article, we present three dimensions demonstrating platform functions of game engines beyond gaming. We rely on the example of two important game engine developers: Epic Games and Unity Technologies. The dimensions are (1) the growing area of extended reality applications, (2) cross-platform and cross-media story- and brand worlds, and (3) the management of user payments, identities, and social graphs. The article shows how companies providing game engines challenge the current balance of power between established platform companies, demonstrating that game engines have emerged as an important new type of platform that demands academic and public attention.}

This paper works to make such an advance by drawing on the underdeveloped idea of attentional control – that is direction of members’ attention - within the ABV. The paper develops the concept of attentional control systems and as its core contribution proposes that firms can use issue-specific emergent attentional control systems to address emergent strategic issues that are characteristic of post-Chandlerian environments. Key components of these systems include emergent, issue-specific communication channels, reconfigured roles, and interactive control practices. These three interrelated attentional control mechanisms enable attentional dynamism and high-quality attention to be directed towards emergent strategic issues, thus mediating effective strategic decision-making as well as resource commitment and ultimately enhancing strategic adaptation.}

abstract = {In the present study, we aimed to explore the effects of sleep restriction (SR) on self-reported golf putting skills. Eleven collegiate golfers participated in a self-reported, counterbalanced experimental study under two conditions: (a) a SR condition in which sleep on the night prior to putting was restricted to 4–5 hours, and (b) a habitual normal sleep (NS) condition on the night before the putting test. Following each sleep condition, participants engaged in ten consecutive putting tests at 7 am, 11 am, and 3 pm. Participants reported their subjective sleepiness before each time frame, and their chronotype, defined as their individual circadian preference, was scored based on a morningness–eveningness questionnaire (MEQ). Participants restricted sleep to an average period of 267.6 minutes/night (SD = 51.2) in the SR condition and 426.2 (SD =38.0) minutes/night in the NS condition. A two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of the sleep condition on the lateral displacement of putts from the target (lateral misalignment) (p = 0.002). In addition, there was a significant main effect of time on distance from the target (distance misalignment) (p = 0.017), indicating less accuracy of putting in the SR condition. In the SR condition, the MEQ score was positively correlated with distance misalignment at 3 pm (ρ = 0.650, p = 0.030), suggesting that morningness types are susceptible to the effects of SR on putting performance. Our findings suggest that golfers should obtain sufficient sleep to optimize putting performance.}

Despite common interests in research questions, methodologies, and empirical contexts by scholars from across these fields, the literature has developed mostly in isolated fashion. This article offers a systematic and interdisciplinary review of the literature on platform competition by analyzing a sample of 333 articles published between 1985 and 2019. The review contributes by (a) documenting how the literature on platform competition has evolved; (b) outlining four themes of shared scholarly interest, including how network effects generate “winner-takes-all” dynamics that influence strategies, such as pricing and quality; how network externalities and platform strategy interact with corporate-level decisions, such as vertical integration or diversification into complementary goods; how heterogeneity in the platform and its users influences platform dynamics; and how the platform “hub” orchestrates value creation and capture in the overall ecosystem; and (c) highlighting several areas for future research. The review aims to facilitate a broader understanding of the platform competition research that helps to advance our knowledge of how platforms compete to create and capture value.}

Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review about this topic, where 75 reviewed studies were analyzed according to the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) components. Findings highlighted that: (1) from the subject component, future research should involve more stakeholders, like parents and policymakers, when discussing tolerance education; (2) from the object component, tolerance education should not only focus on the physical environment, but also on the virtual environment; (3) from the tools component, limited digital tools and technology have been used to promote tolerance education; (4) from the community component, more investigation of tolerance education should be outside of school contexts; (5) from the rules component, more ICT training should be provided. The use of big data and learning analytics could be one of the potential methods to assess students in tolerance education; (6) from the labor division component, school family interaction role is very important to manage risks and diversities through tolerance education; and (7) from the outcomes component, tolerance education studies should go beyond simply investigating the awareness and attitudes of learners, and investigate, for instance, the behavioral changes of learners. Finally, recommendations were made under each CHAT component.}

We define the adoption and adaption of journalistic conventions in political communication as a particular communication style, conceptualized as “parasitic news”. The article presents an analytical framework that explicates the role of parasitic news across five dimensions: ideological transparency/position, alternativeness, news genres, individual vs. collective media practices, and social media affordances. An analysis of three news projects, representing right-wing populist, liberal/conservative, and left-wing/green ideological positions, reveals that parasitic news is a flexible communication style that blurs the boundaries of politics and media in online spaces. Moreover, parasitic news challenges the relevance of established terms such as alternative, hyper-partisan, and fake news, pointing to the need of a renewed conceptual vocabulary in journalism, media and political communication research.}

As a broad but contested toolkit of technological services and policy interventions aimed at improving the efficacy and efficiency of urban systems, the “smart city” is subject to several pressing critiques.

As such, we focus on an under-researched dimension of smart city urbanism: its application in peripheral urban areas. The paper introduces a threefold typology of: (a) geographic (spatial); (b) hard (material); and (c) soft (social) urban peripherality. Second, it reviews the concept of urban resilience and considers how its central characteristics can inform the objectives and implementation of “smart city” infrastructures and planning. Six European smart city plans are assessed via a qualitative content analysis, to identify the target of smart city actions; the characteristics of urban resilience mobilized; and the spatial focus of planned interventions. The comparative analysis reveals a variegated set of smart-city approaches. Notably, “smart” actions aimed at enhancing social innovation are the most common type of intervention, while overall there remains a strong tendency for smart urbanism to focus on the urban core. We conclude by calling for a research agenda addressing smartness in, of, and for, peripheral urban spaces and communities.}

abstract = {India is one of the significant merchants of handicrafts and handloom to the world arcade. From economic standpoint, the sector is important in terms of foreign exchange that it earns, aided by low investments and increased value addition. As per the latest estimates available, there are more than 23 million handloom and handicraft artisans in India now, constantly engaged in growth of Indian handicraft and handloom industry. In addition to maintaining the aristocracy, handicraft goods provide primary maintenance to the nation’s tremendous number of rural citizens. However, these goods’ contemporary markets are slowly collapsing. A big number of examines are evident of this datum. Major factors attributed to this can be due to lack of sales promotions and exposure. This study will excavate out the public opinion through an empirical approach. Implied findings of this investigation will strongly advocate the policy level implication as well as managerial governance to boost the promotion of handicraft through online sales and e-commerce platform through the development of RURBAN centres. Besides these, the researches will uniquely pistil ate out the unique value creation of Indian handicraft industry to a global platform.}

Two case studies explored the use of an automated system called cyber–ideation (Gibson, 2000b) as a method to stimulate idea generation. This procedure employed individual and team involvement, recursive and linear exploration, and manual and digital processes. Analysis compared students’ production using traditional ideation processes with that resulting from cyber–ideation. Results from this case study found that: 1) digital creation was more linear when evaluated against traditional ideation output, 2) cyber–ideation had a positive impact on team dynamics, and 3) automated output possessed greater surface delineation when compared with subjects’ manual sketching.}

Maintaining a sustainable, resilient, and durable healthcare system facilitate economies to achieve sustainable competitiveness. Thus, it is important to address and fill the knowledge gap by identifying factors that improve a firm’s sustainability. Drawing on technological knowledge spillover theory, this study investigates the effect of FinTech development on the sustainable performance of healthcare firms using panel data comprised of 11 Asia-Pacific countries. By applying the 2-step GMM technique, we find a robust estimate that digital financial technologies improve the sustainable performance of the firms. Contrary to the substitution effect, our results further indicate that financial institutions are collaborating with FinTechs to facilitate financing at the individual and firm-level. We also find that financial and ICT development positively moderates the relationship between FinTech development and sustainable performance.}

ExC provides a framework to enhance the understanding of the impact of pervasive computing and smart technology on consumer decision-making and the behavioural impacts of consumer analytics. To this end, the article provides commentary and structures to outline the impact of ExC and to elaborate the definition and reach of ExC. The logic of ExC culminates in a theory of cognitive states comprising of three potential decision states: endogenous cognition, symbiotic cognition and surrogate cognition. These states are posited as transient (consumers might move between them during a purchase episode) and determined by individual propensities and situational antecedents. The article latterly provides various potential empirical avenues and issues for consideration and debate.}

Drawing on 31 in-depth interviews with freelancers who have relocated to peripheral Southern European locales, the article explores the ways in which creative workers make sense of and justify their career transitions away from the metropolis, while reassessing reflexively over their lifespan the shifting meaning of their career success. We propose the adoption of Nussbaum’s capability approach in the study of such career transitions as a means of strengthening current theorizing about the role played by urban contexts in individual conceptualizations of career success and meaningful professional identities. Applying this analytical lens, we tease out the ways in which our informants perceived the influence exerted by different urban contexts on their capacity to enact a set of capabilities for the attainment of well-being and quality of life at different stages in their careers while striving to preserve a stable professional identity as creative workers. We argue that a good life evaluation, which includes a reflexive and comprehensive reassessment of the capabilities to live life well while pursuing a creative career, underlies creative workers’ shifting interpretations of geographical career transition that contravene conventional measures of career upward mobility, development and growth.}

abstract = {Media studies scholarship on advertising has traditionally fallen into two camps. Cultural analysis emphasizes the signals advertisements send to consumers, focusing primarily on the role of advertising creatives. Economic analysis emphasizes advertising’s impact on media companies’ financial performance, focusing on the role of sales managers and proprietors. Both approaches minimize the role of reporters, against whose work advertisers place their messages. This article draws on interviews, as well as financial analysis, at six newsrooms to examine the impact of advertising practices on the editorial independence of reporters. Combining cultural and economic analysis, the article highlights the unique threat advertiser influence poses to critical business reporting, which takes as its subject the very firms who must choose to advertise against it. The article argues that the new forms of advertising, where branded content is presented alongside, and intended to mimic, reported content, increase the threat of advertiser capture. At four legacy outlets studied, investigative business coverage has declined as media organizations react to the changed operating environment with practices that compromise the divide between news and advertising staff. At two online startups studied, where new advertising formats have always been part of strategy, news and sales staff remain separate. Yet there is limited appetite at these outlets for conducting critical business journalism, which is not seen as key to organizational mission. The article concludes with policy recommendations to safeguard the viability of critical business journalism.}

Debates over open access (OA), however, rarely extend from questions of distribution to questions of how OA is transforming the politics of academic knowledge production. This article argues that the movement towards OA rests on a relatively stable moral episteme that positions different actors involved in the economy of OA (authors, publishers, the general public), and most importantly, knowledge itself. The analysis disentangles the ontological and moral side of these claims, showing how OA changes the meaning of knowledge from a good in the economic, to good in the moral sense. This means OA can be theorized as the moral economy of digital knowledge production. Ultimately, using Boltanski and Thévenot’s work on justification, the article reflects on how this moral economy frames the political subjectivity of actors and institutions involved in academic knowledge production.}

Critiques of its romanticization of grassroots participation and objections to its neglect of the political economy of media convergence are particularly pertinent in the context of China where media is under state control despite the drastic platformization of society. The present study probes China’s convergence culture through a sociolinguistic lens. We examine patterns of convergence in the usage of a viral social address, meinü (美女, literally “beautiful woman”), and we survey the perception of this term across social categories. Results on usage pointed to a linguistic convergence of popular culture and state media, which fuels the viral spread of meinü in China’s digital ecosystem where interactions between stakeholders defy a simple user–censor dichotomy. Results on perception showed a generational contestation. Contrary to previous findings, older Chinese are more likely than younger Chinese to use meinü, and older women experience gratification when called meinü but younger women experience effrontery at its use. The generation gap suggests socially distributed experiences and practices among China’s digital media participants. Our study not only reveals the complexities, contradictions, and contingencies of media convergence in China, but also has theoretical and empirical implications for convergence culture.}

Maximal and relative isometric force of the lower limbs were significantly improved. Moreover, toe and ankle linear velocity during ball contact, ball velocity, as well as ankle, knee and hip angular velocities of the kicking leg were significantly increased.

abstract = {To improve SME growth and competitiveness, governments often encourage business owner-managers to make use of external sources of support. Whether they seek this depends on the degree to which they perceive themselves to need assistance. Additionally, its use can be constrained by market failures. In this paper, we model whether SME owner-managers seek information and advice from formal sources, including public and private providers. In 2011, the researchers conducted a telephone survey of 1202 SMEs (1–249 employees) in England to assess the use and non-use of external support between 2008 and 2011. Using a contingency approach, we model various influences on the use and non-use of formal support and identify those owner-managers who face more concerns but have less confidence in their capabilities. We find that the demand for support, especially from private providers, is fuelled by a firm’s objective to grow and a size threshold, although this is moderated by various concerns which increase the likelihood of using public sources. The willingness to take informal advice can act as a stepping stone to using formal sources. Whilst market failures affected less than a fifth of firms, those with women directors were particularly affected as were newly founded firms.}

It has not only changed our work-related travel patterns but also impacted leisure and other utilitarian activities. Non–work-related trips tend to be more seriously affected by the neighborhood/contextual factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), and destination accessibility, and COVID-19 impact on non-work trips may not be equal across different neighborhood SES. This study compares non–work-related travel patterns between the pre- and during COVID-19 pandemic in the City of El Paso, Texas. By utilizing smartphone mobility data, we captured the visitation data for major non-work destinations such as restaurants, supermarkets, drinking places, religious organizations, and parks. We used Census block groups (n = 424) within the city and divided them into low- and high-income neighborhoods based on the citywide median. Overall, the total frequency of visitations and the distances traveled to visit these non-work destinations were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, significant variations existed in their visitation patterns by the type of non-work destinations. While the overall COVID-19 effects on non-work activities were evident, its effects on the travel patterns to each destination were not equal by neighborhood SES. We also found that COVID-19 had differently influenced non-work activities between high- and low-income block groups. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate neighborhood-level inequalities in non-work trips. Thus, safe and affordable transportation options together with compact and walkable community development appear imperative to support daily travel needs for various utilitarian and leisure purposes, especially in low-income neighborhoods.}

Findings rendered a contextualisation of school management practices.

The research on project management and careers is therefore urgently needed in order to better understand the processes and systems shaping the careers of project managers. We address this gap by reviewing several key career theories and constructs and examining how these are mobilized to understand project managers’ careers in existing research. Our main conclusion is that boundaryless career theory has been the dominant career perspective in project management research, whereas other career theories—specifically protean career theory, social cognitive career theory, career construction theory, and sustainable career theory—are far less often mobilized as a basis for studies. We also find that some of the most popular constructs in careers research, such as career success and employability, have been used in recent project management research. However, their use in these studies is often implicit and does not necessarily leverage existing work from the careers field. We argue that there is strong potential for further and more systematic integration between project management and careers research in order to enrich both fields, and we offer a research agenda as a starting point.}

This article draws on interviews, as well as financial analysis, at six newsrooms to examine the impact of advertising practices on the editorial independence of reporters. Combining cultural and economic analysis, the article highlights the unique threat advertiser influence poses to critical business reporting, which takes as its subject the very firms who must choose to advertise against it. The article argues that the new forms of advertising, where branded content is presented alongside, and intended to mimic, reported content, increase the threat of advertiser capture. At four legacy outlets studied, investigative business coverage has declined as media organizations react to the changed operating environment with practices that compromise the divide between news and advertising staff. At two online startups studied, where new advertising formats have always been part of strategy, news and sales staff remain separate. Yet there is limited appetite at these outlets for conducting critical business journalism, which is not seen as key to organizational mission. The article concludes with policy recommendations to safeguard the viability of critical business journalism.}

abstract = {Digital game-based learning (DGBL) interventions can be superior to traditional instruction methods for learning, but previous meta-analyses covered a huge period and included a variety of different target groups, limiting the results’ transfer on specific target groups. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is a theory-based examination of DGBL interventions’ effects on different learning outcomes (cognitive, metacognitive, affective-motivational) in the school context, using studies published between 2015 and 2020 and meta-analytic techniques (including moderator analyses) to examine the effectiveness of DGBL interventions compared to traditional instruction methods. Results from random-effects models revealed a significant medium effect for overall learning (g = .54) and cognitive learning outcomes (g = .67). Also found were a small effect for affective-motivational learning outcomes (g = .32) and no significant effect for metacognitive learning outcomes. Additionally, there was no evidence of publication bias. Further meta-regression models did not reveal evidence of moderating personal, environmental, or confounding factors. The findings partially support the positive impact of DGBL interventions in school, and the study addresses its practical implications.}

abstract = {Background: This article reports on a study that investigated data professionals in health care. The topic is interesting and relevant because of the ongoing trend towards digitisation of the healthcare domain and efforts for it to become data driven, which entail a wide variety of work with data. Objective: Despite an interest in data science and more broadly in data work, we know surprisingly little about the people who work with data in healthcare. Therefore, we investigated data work at a large national healthcare data organisation in Denmark. Method: An explorative mixed method approach combining a non-probability technique for design of an open survey with a target population of 300+ and 11 semi-structured interviews, was applied. Results: We report findings relevant to educational background, work identity, work tasks, and how staff acquired competences and knowledge, as well as what these attributes comprised. We found recurring themes of healthcare knowledge, data analytical skills, and information technology, reflected in education, competences and knowledge. However, there was considerable variation within and beyond those themes, and indeed most competences were learned “on the job” rather than as part of formal education. Conclusion: Becoming a professional working with data in health care can be the result of different career paths. The most recurring work identity was that of “data analyst”; however, a wide variety of responses indicated that a stable data worker identity has not yet developed. Implications: The findings present implications for educational policy makers and healthcare managers.}

Ecosystems evolve when these forces change. For example, technological complementarities—the main source of centripetal force—are dynamic and may be commoditized, generalized, or standardized over time. Management and coordination also change: for example, open innovation practices enable firms to move innovation activities from the in-house R&D lab out into the ecosystem. This article discusses how such dynamics in technologies and management lead to ecosystem evolution.}

Using a mixed strategy with a case study design, data were collected in 14 countries using structured interviews with 24 organisations linked to security in the European Union, including 6 linked to the EGF. After densifying the evolution of conflict, the window of opportunity that led to creation of the EGF and the implications of EGF’s current organisation not having structures dedicated exclusively to gender, suggestions obtained from the primary information were dissected. Integration of ideas in the literature with the results of this study suggest that the main obstacles to innovation for implementation of the WGS result from: (a) existing limitations in the institutions that make up the EGF; (b) lack of a plan to implement the WGS agenda; (c) lack of resources (materials and/or structures dedicated to gender); and (d) failure to incorporate a gender perspective into all planning dimensions.}

abstract = {Industry experts estimate that there could be over 15 million gig economy workers in India. Despite its massive potential, India’s gig economy is still at a very nascent stage. Due to the recent pandemic, many companies were forced to trim staff and hire gig workers due to uncertain market conditions. This has dispelled many reservations about the dependability and long-term viability of a gig workforce. India can emerge as one of the largest markets for flexible staffing globally. It is therefore apt that a research article traces the Indian gig economy and draws valid inferences for the human resource (HR) function. The objective of this article is to review and synthesise themes and narratives around gig economy from the perspective of people’s function. The study analyses the concepts in two phases. In phase I, we summarise the key concepts from academic research. We, further, extract the opinions of business professionals; in phase II, using text mining techniques in SPSS Modeler Text of qualitative data discussed in the Indian context is used to come up with the gig economy narrative in India. This inductive research draws inferences from secondary data available in newspapers, magazines, blogs, research journals and comments posted on social media like LinkedIn and Twitter. The findings of this article reveal how gig economy has shaped the employer–employee relationship. While doing so, we present the opportunities and challenges for the gig workers, the influence of the pandemic in fuelling the gig economy and perception of the organisations. There is more positive sentiment and optimism around the gig economy in India. The role of the managers will transform in this model, and functions like learning and development and performance management will undergo vital changes. Creating a sense of inclusion and belongingness among the gig workers will become a priority. Therefore, to become a stable employment model, there is a need to create a robust gig ecosystem where expectations of all the important stakeholders are understood and met. Implication: The union budget 2021–2022 for the first time acknowledged the gig economy and announced social security benefits for the gig workers. It is time for HR and policymakers to redesign policies and processes that will not just accommodate gig workers into the formal employment but also foster inclusion. The exhaustive review of literature provides a holistic picture of gig economy to scholars interested in the field of gig economy, psychological contract, and diversity and inclusion. Practitioners can use insights from this research study to manage, engage and retain their gig talent.}

abstract = {For the past two decades, understandings of the scale of digital disruption in journalism work in post-industrialised countries have relied on data about newspaper closures, newsroom job losses and the creation of new full-time jobs in journalism. Yet, the digital economy has fostered new employment and work arrangements, and there is less secure employment in journalism, making it more difficult to define who is a journalist now. Using a case study of Australian journalists seeking re-employment after newsroom job loss, this article examines some of the emerging patterns of atypical journalism work. It concludes that attempts to measure the current extent of journalism work need to explicitly account for hybrid careers characterised by professional activities at the margins of or outside of traditional newsroom work. In the digital economy, journalists may undertake a range of journalism and non-journalism work simultaneously or sequentially.}

Third parties provide either by-product data about their clients, or data that are generated for the specific task of a more accurate measurement of behaviour. One of the core building blocks in insurance is understanding risk – therefore, innovation around data points (sources and analytics) to proxy risk is the engine behind its digital transformation. While the value of data points is clear for the providers of insurance products and services, the customers have not only less control over their data, but also hardly benefit from the creation of those data points. In this paper we provide a case study from the British car insurance industry, about a data-driven product that pivoted into a re-designed personal data right architecture, which included transparency, traceability and usability of customers’ digital traces, and enabled customers’ ownership rights over their data.}

abstract = {Studies about media self-censorship typically focus on its mechanism in traditional newsroom settings. But how media self-censorship may evolve in online journalism has remained largely unexplored. Using Hong Kong as a case, I examine the digital evolution of media self-censorship in a unique non-democratic context. Drawing on interviews with online journalists, my findings reveal that digital transformation has provided new valences for media self-censorship. With the financial hardship of legacy media in the digital age, Hong Kong online journalists are more directly exposed to external threats such as advertisement boycotts orchestrated by the state, and hence increasingly reluctant to offend external powerholders out of the fear of political and financial retaliation. Moreover, as online journalists adopt business-driven norms that favor the generation of clicks, political or policy news are further marginalized. These stories are often deemed boring, non-engaging to online audiences, and are not “sensationalizable” due to political risks, especially when compared to soft news types like crimes and lifestyles stories. Adapting to these changes, news managers are increasingly used to avoiding professional editorial debates that results are unpredictable but using “objective” web metrics as persuasive devices to discourage the production of sensitive news. Lastly, the dissemination of sensitive news is curbed in the social media gatekeeping process. These findings suggest that an authoritarian state can effectively influence online news production by controlling the capital that drives digital transformation, thereby limiting the liberating potential of the media in the digital age.}

While most studies focus on how travelling ideas translate into organizational practices, we lack insights into the broader issue of how ideas translate as they move among heterogeneous actors across the field. To explore this multidirectional travelling of ideas, we build on the notion of translation ecology to capture the ongoing interactions among field members as they are involved in translation work within and outside adopting organizations. To develop our argument, we draw from a longitudinal, 20-year case study of a public sector digital transformation programme in Denmark through which ideas about mobile technology use for caregivers spread across the entire homecare field. By following the mobile technology initiative over time, we show how ideas travelled in multiple directions as adopting organizations and other influential field actors participated in and contributed to diverse practices across organizations. Based on our analyses, we identify three distinct forms of multidirectional idea travelling – reinforcing, complementing and polarizing – and describe how they together shape the morphing of ideas as they move among heterogeneous actors in a translation ecology. As a result, we advance knowledge about multidirectional idea travelling as an under-theorized and important perspective in the translation literature.}

The results shed light on the key role of digital platforms in KPIs constructions to assess healthcare performance. By exploring and merging the mentioned topics, we build a conceptual framework about the possible drivers for measuring healthcare performance, leading to the provision of instant care with a high degree of preventive capacity and decreasing costs. Our conceptual study could be useful for policymakers, practitioners, and academics interested in this area. From a theoretical point of view, the study offers valuable insights into two main fields: digital transformation in healthcare and performance measurement. It is a valuable tool for healthcare managers to redefine strategies based on patients. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of institutions’ contributions to promoting digitization. It is not without limits. The results can be context-sensitive. Future research can extend the analysis to compare results in different countries making results generalizable.}

Mounting decentralized processes onto a blockchain-based computerized network will endow the values of immutability, improved cybersecurity, and potential for incentivizing stakeholders for relevant, pre-determined activities. One of the most relevant processes that would benefit from a decentralized, blockchain-based architecture is the submission, review, and publishing of scientific manuscripts. Current structures and processes in this world are non-transparent, poorly incentivizing significant stakeholders such as manuscripts’ reviewers, and many are potentially corrupted. In this review, we suggest a blockchain-based architecture for such systems and advocate further research and development in several domains of modern healthcare systems—offering medicine to become “the new guy on the block (chain).”}

Using PISA 2018 data for 15-year-old students and hierarchical linear models, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between ICT use at school and students’ performance in mathematics in 22 OECD countries. In all cases, the excessive use of technology is associated with a lower academic performance, although this penalty differs across countries, which points to the importance of addressing country-specific analyses. The differentiated profile of those very intensive users, who suffer from above-average bullying exposure, draws into question whether the effect can be deemed as causal. Based on Inverse Probability Weighting techniques, the findings indicate that the very intensive use of ICT at school causes an underperformance of students equivalent to around half an academic course in Estonia, Finland and Spain. The results highlight the need for policy makers and instructors to ensure that the frequent use of ICT at school does not interfere with students’ learning process.}

abstract = {Specialized clusters rely on common knowledge resources and extra-cluster linkages, but how such resources develop over time is unclear. A case in point is how extra-cluster linkages are integrated into intra-cluster networks and the role of different cluster actors in enhancing cluster absorptive capacity. The paper explores the role of cluster intermediaries in linking clusters to external knowledge sources and contributing to knowledge dissemination among cluster firms. This perspective is relevant as manufacturing firms are facing rapid changes in technology, such as those associated with “Industry 4.0”. Two manufacturing clusters in Norway are studied regarding cluster absorptive capacities and the role of cluster intermediaries. The authors derive two types of cluster intermediaries with different kinds of service provision well-adjusted to the firm structure. Cluster intermediaries in both cluster contexts can assist firms in tracking and adapting to rapid technological developments.}

The need to develop these policies, tools and measures has become pertinent, considering that the Irish media workforce currently lacks diversity. The aims of this article are twofold: (i) examine the tools and measures from the international media industry that have been developed to improve equality, diversity and inclusion and (ii) interrogate how these tools and measures could work within the Irish context. Through sampling tools and measures developed in varying media industries in English language territories, this research used this analysis as the basis of semi-structured interviews with independent production companies and broadcasters in Ireland, to gauge how the media industry can develop equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives. This article identifies four central areas that would encourage further diversity in the Irish media sector: data gathering and monitoring, developing diversity standards, objective setting and incentivization and diverse recruitment for the industry.}

abstract = {In recent years, pandemics have become one of the most significant challenges due to their huge socio-economic impacts. Fortunately, smart technologies have provided new ideas to fight against them. Many studies have focused on analyzing particular technologies applied in pandemics, but few have systematically discussed the difference and the relationship among multiple perspectives. China is well represented in the development of technologies and pandemic responses. Therefore, this paper uses China’s response to COVID-19 as an empirical study to systematically review the application of smart technologies and build a case base from multiple perspectives. A total of 1,102 cases from 14 technologies were collected from January 2020 to June 2020 after screening, and a series of analyses were conducted in terms of types, scales, stages, and targets. The result shows various subjects participated in pandemic responses using smart technologies. General technologies such as Big Data and Mobile Internet are most widely used. Besides, most technologies are used on the country or district/city scales and focus on the prevention and control of pandemics. There are significant differences in the penetration of technologies among different perspectives. We hope to provide a reference for applying smart technologies against pandemics in the future.}

In this article, we conduct a pragmatic review of existing research on government and public service organization use of social media using an interrogative approach (i.e., what, who, why, how, and where to) to develop a theory that encapsulates the unique peculiarities of social media use in the public sector. Our review proposes a unified theory of open government and social mediatization to explain this finding, wherein the connectivity, programmability, and popularity of social media results in (1) the adoption and use of social media as a technology in the public sector (i.e., social mediatization) and (2) the harvest of information availability, participation, collaboration, and transparency for open government. Our review concludes with several recommendations to pollinate future research in this area.}

To address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has influenced the financial technology (FinTech) industry in London, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in London’s FinTech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies. Our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an EE. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms’ characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks. With regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms’ egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses.}

Using the lens of corporate digital responsibility (CDR), we examine these risks and their mitigation in service firms and make five contributions. First, we show that CDR is critical in service contexts because of the vast streams of customer data involved and digital service technology’s omnipresence, opacity, and complexity. Second, we synthesize the ethics, privacy, and fairness literature using the CDR data and technology life-cycle perspective to understand better the nature of these risks in a service context. Third, to provide insights on the origins of these risks, we examine the digital service ecosystem and the related flows of money, service, data, insights, and technologies. Fourth, we deduct that the underlying causes of CDR issues are trade-offs between good CDR practices and organizational objectives (e.g., profit opportunities versus CDR risks) and introduce the CDR calculus to capture this. We also conclude that regulation will need to step in when a firm’s CDR calculus becomes so negative that good CDR is unlikely. Finally, we advance a set of strategies, tools, and practices service firms can use to manage these trade-offs and build a strong CDR culture.}

Narratives are studied as a vehicle and an opportunity for self–expression and discovery for first–year students to explore and produce atmospheres. The project Staging Poe draws its narrative inspirations from Edgar Allan Poe’s poems. It proposes to approach atmosphere through a narrative method, by translating words into materiality. Narratives of literary works are proposed to novice students as starting points while stepping into the not–yet–familiar ways of the design process. Staging Poe further envisions a first–year design studio rooted in ongoing contemporary debates on the theory and practice of atmosphere and materiality in tandem with technology. The objective is to inspire a new generation of interior architecture students. This paper begins by discussing the theory of atmospheres and the potential role of narratives in exploring atmosphere within the Basic Design studio. Next, we examine Poe’s The Philosophy of Composition as a guide to translating narrative into atmosphere before discussing the design of the Staging Poe project and the two consecutive phases of its methodology. Student progress is reviewed through an analysis of weekly reports and followed by an examination of the students’ overall performance in the course. The findings of the analysis demonstrate how the structure of the studio advances student design thinking and performance in relation to their understanding of atmosphere and its material and quasimaterial agents. The study concludes that there is room for the exploration of alternative and field–specific methods in the education of interior architecture discipline.}

abstract = {Recent technological and institutional changes in journalism are believed to have dragged cultural journalism into a crisis. This article looks closely at one thing that makes the job of cultural journalists, in particular critics, distinct from other journalistic beats – the openly acknowledged importance of emotionality and subjectivity in these media workers’ professional practices – and explores the role of emotions in dealing with the crisis in the profession. Based on 14 semi-structured interviews with film and food critics, this article addresses the following questions: What emotional labour do the cultural critics perform? How does professional cultural criticism legitimize itself in the digital era? I suggest that both the film and food critics cherish the fact that their work processes draw heavily on their subjectivity: emotional experiences, political opinions and personal memories. However, to be able do their job, the critics cannot allow such elements of subjectivity to take the reins, and therefore, they perform emotional labour for the successful objectivization of their emotionality: making use of their emotions to better recognize what moments or aspects are significant for the assessment of the quality of the cultural object being reviewed. Furthermore, I suggest that in the context where digitalization has threatened the exceptional position of the professional cultural critic, emotional labour together with some other strategies of handling one’s subjectivity can help them to construct boundaries of professional cultural criticism and thus to reclaim professional legitimacy.}

Adopting the products of theorising approach, this study views metaphors as central sensemaking and sensegiving devices that shape the interpretation of RPA among stakeholders towards a preferred reality of ways of seeing and experiencing software robots. The empirical materials are drawn from research in three Australasian organisations that have implemented RPA. Grounding our analysis in the domains-interaction model, we identified three root metaphors: person, robot and tool, their constitutive conceptual metaphors, and intended use as heuristics devices. Our findings show that metaphor is a powerful device that employees rely on to make sense of their experiences with a new digital technology that can potentially shape their roles, work practices and job design. In addition, managers and automation team members intentionally leverage metaphors to shape others’ perceptions of a software robot’s capabilities and limitations, its implication for human work and its expanding benefits for organisations over time, among others. Metaphor as a precursor to more formal theory provides scholars with a vocabulary to understand disparate experiences with an emergent automation technology that can be further developed to generate a theory of seeing automation and working with automated agents.}

We analyse the policing of migration through biometric technologies as the reproduction of social practices of security against crime. By combining concepts of social practices and ethical regimes, we suggest that biometric ethical regimes are constituted by social practices working towards legitimising the use of biomaterials and biodata. This analytical synthesis supports us in exploring how biometric technologies deployed in the policing of crime circulate into the policing of migration and vice versa. First, technologies as materials (DNA, fingerprints, facial images, analysis kits, databases, etc.) are inscribed with assumptions about validating identity and suspicion, and are increasingly made accessible as data across policy domains. Second, forensic competence moves in abstracted forms of expertise independent of context and ethics of application, creating challenges for reliable and legitimate technology deployment. Third, biometric technologies, often portrayed as reliable, useful, accurate policing tools, travel from crime into migration control with meanings that construct generalised criminal suspicion of migrants. To evidence the complexity and difficulty of achieving accountability and responsibility for the ethical governance of biometric technologies in policing, we trace how the goals, risks, benefits and values of biometric technologies are framed, and how the legitimacy of their deployment in policing of migration is constructed and negotiated.}

abstract = {Objective This study explored the Swedish digital health testbeds through the lens of complexity science. Methods The purposive sampling was used to identify 38 digital health testbed organizations to conduct interviews in written or audio-conferencing. The interview responses were aggregated and analyzed using thematic analysis. The themes were mainly generated through complexity theory and the principles of complex adaptive systems. Results Fifteen testbed organizations responded, comprising 13 written responses and two audio-conferencing. Five main theoretical themes were generated: agents and diversity, connections and communication, adaptation and learning, perturbations, and path dependence. Agents and diversity depicted different types of testbeds, stakeholders and innovation, and the primary function and purpose of the testbeds. Various factors enhancing connections and communications among multiple stakeholders were identified, such as the quality of e-health solutions and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Some adaptation and learning factors, such as internal reorganization, sharing and creating learning opportunities, and additional funding, guaranteed the sustainability of testbeds. Perturbations were characterized by two factors: non-linear interactions – lack of commitment and transparency in stakeholders’ engagement, and uncertainty about testbed definitions and concepts. Path dependence highlighted the importance of history, such as previous positive and negative experiences. Conclusion This study provided insights into testbeds’ organization, their functions, how various aspects were challenged, and how they adapted to overcome and improve the system issues. Identifying the stakeholders and relevant factors, commissioning an evaluation, backing up with a contingency plan, securing adequate funding, and disseminating the findings can improve the testbeds’ design and implementation.}

abstract = {While management and network scholars have long asked why some groups adapt to innovation more readily than others, such questions have been surprisingly absent in studies of new media production. We offer a network analytical framework which relates producers’ informal networks to their capacity to adopt digital innovations. Through a network ethnography of 4264 romance writers, we find that established authors who reversed traditional advice patterns, by seeking advice from inexperienced newcomers rather than experienced peers, were more likely to adopt digital self-publishing. By linking the concept of relational labor to network structures, we demonstrate the value of “networking down” in a digitally disrupted cultural industry—a surprising finding in a business where networking up, to powerful actors, has seemed critical for success. We argue that strategic relational labor by established content creators facilitates adaptation to digital conditions and provides some measure of protection against precarity in a changing landscape.}

abstract = {Introduction Due to the growing burden of disease in South Africa, encompassing conditions such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and cancer, the holistic management of affected patients incorporating ototoxicity monitoring is a necessity. However, ototoxicity monitoring in developing countries may be limited due to a lack of resources and inadequate healthcare facilities. Subsequently, the use of tele-audiology may be a revolutionary technique with the potential to provide audiology services to under-served populations with limited access. Methods The study aimed to describe the use of tele-audiology services in ototoxicity monitoring through a scoping review of English peer-reviewed articles from June 2009 to June 2020. Seventeen articles were purposively selected from the following databases: PubMed, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis Online, WorldCat, and Google Scholar. Data was extracted as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram and results were analyzed using deductive thematic analysis. Results and discussion While a minority of the studies indicated that the cost of implementation and network connectivity within a South African context pose as barriers, most researchers reported that tele-audiology provides a reliable, time-efficient, cost-effective, and easily accessible alternative for ototoxicity monitoring. Hardware including the WAHTS, KUDUwave, and OtoID, along with software such as the TabSINT, Otocalc, uHear, and the hearTest, have proven to be useful for ototoxicity monitoring. A need for further investigations regarding the feasibility of tele-audiology implementation in South Africa is evident. Despite this, it provides audiologists with an opportunity to offer contact-less services during COVID-19, thus, confirming its versatility as an augmentative method for ototoxicity monitoring.}

abstract = {Objective To identify a subset of software issues occurring in daily Swedish healthcare practice and devise a set of local solutions to overcome the challenges. Methods A sample of 46 incident reports was collected from one of Sweden’s national incident reporting repositories, ranging from June 2019 to December 2021. The reports were first subjected to an algorithm to identify if they were health information technology-related incidents and were analysed using an existing framework, i.e., the Health Information Technology Classification System, to identify the software-related incidents. The incidents associated with software issues were then subjected to thematic analysis, in which themes were extracted and presented under the category assigned by the existing framework used. Results Of 46 reports, 45 (with one exception) were included using the algorithm. Of 45 incidents, 31 software-related incidents were identified using the classification system. Six types of software issues were identified, including software functionality (n = 10), interface with other software systems or components (n = 10), system configuration (n = 7), interface with devices (n = 2), record migration (n = 1) and increased volume of transactions (n = 1). Each issue was further categorised into different themes; for example, software interface-related problems were grouped into “two patients being active in the system simultaneously” (n = 6) and “transfer of patient information” (n = 4). Conclusions The study provided some insights into software issues and relevant consequences. A set of local solutions were devised to overcome the present challenges encountered in Swedish healthcare in their daily clinical practice. Systematic identification and characterisation of such software challenges should be a routine part of clinical practice for all major health information technology implementations.}

abstract = {Background Health ministries in Europe are investing increasingly in innovative digital technologies. Older adults, who have not grown up with digital innovation, are expected to keep up with technological shifts as much as other age groups. This is ethically challenging, as it may threaten a sense of dignity and well-being in older adults. Research objective To clarify the phenomenon of sense of dignity experienced in older adults, concerning how their expectations and needs are met within the context of digitally led healthcare in Norway. Research design A Reflective Lifeworld Research design was chosen, and purposive, in-depth interviews were conducted. Participants and research context The participants were 13 adults 75 years and older from Northern Norway, living at home and not receiving consistent assistance. Ethical considerations Followed the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. This study was approved by the Social Science Data Services in Norway (project number 916119). Interviews were conducted carefully within a safe environment chosen by the participants. Findings Older adults experience that using new digital systems in healthcare makes them become dependent with experiences of helplessness. They feel an increased sense of dependency on other people, and that recognition can assail their experience of personal dignity. Older adults not only expect digitally led healthcare to give them a feeling of safety but also experience feeling insecure concerning privacy and loss of possibilities for dialogue with healthcare providers. They are met by demands from society, which they often struggle to achieve. Conclusion The phenomenon of sense of dignity experienced in older adults, concerning how their expectations and needs are met within digitally led healthcare, indicates a sense of feeling lost in the digital world. Further, innovative healthcare lacks focus on ethical performance. This impacts their perception of dignity, as loss of dignity is noticed especially in its rupture.}

abstract = {Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people in various ways, including restricting their mobility and depriving them of exercise opportunities. Such circumstances can trigger locomotor deterioration and impairment, which is known as locomotive syndrome. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of locomotive syndrome in the pandemic and to identify its risk factors. Methods: This was a multicenter questionnaire survey performed between 1 November 2020 and 31 December 2020 in Japan. Patients who visited the orthopedics clinic were asked to answer a questionnaire about their symptoms, exercise habits, and locomotor function at two time points, namely, pre-pandemic and post-second wave (current). The incidence of locomotive syndrome in the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated. Additionally, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for developing locomotive syndrome during the pandemic. Results: A total of 2829 patients were enrolled in this study (average age: 61.1 ± 17.1 years; 1532 women). The prevalence of locomotive syndrome was 30% pre-pandemic, which increased significantly to 50% intra-pandemic. Among the patients with no symptoms of locomotive syndrome, 30% developed it in the wake of the pandemic. In the multinomial logistic regression analysis, older age, deteriorated or newly occurring symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders, complaints about the spine or hip/knee joints, and no or decreased exercise habits were independent risk factors for developing locomotive syndrome. Conclusions: The prevalence of locomotive syndrome in patients with musculoskeletal disorders has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to age, locomotor symptoms, especially spine or hip/knee joint complaints, and exercise habits were associated with the development of locomotive syndrome. Although the control of infection is a priority, the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders and ensuring exercise habits are also essential issues to address during a pandemic such as COVID-19.}

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some of these challenges, as it forced educational institutions to move their pedagogic activities online in line with new governmental regulations. In this article, we identify and discuss critically the following three interconnected challenges: (1) shifting from direct embodied co-presence to technologically mediated telepresence, (2) re-embodying teaching and learning activities and (3) rethinking the purpose and relevance of teachings in business schools. We explore these challenges through a phenomenological lens, informed by the Heideggerian concepts of enframing (Gestell) and releasement (Gelassenheit), with a focus on (re-)embodiment. Finally, we discuss the need, for teachers and learners, to be able to reflectively move between embodied and digital(ised) forms of learning and teaching and outline some implications and perspectives regarding the development of an integral pedagogy.}

abstract = {Boundary resources have been shown to enable the arm’s-length relationships between platform owners and third-party developers that underlie digital innovation in platform ecosystems. While boundary resources that are owned by open-source communities and small-scale software vendors are also critical components in the digital infrastructure, their role in digital innovation has yet to be systematically explored. In particular, software libraries are popular boundary resources that provide functionality without the need for continued interaction with their owners. They are used extensively by commercial vendors to enable customization of their software products, by communities to disseminate open-source software, and by big-tech platform owners to provide functionality that does not involve control. This article reports on the deployment of such software libraries in the web and mobile (Android) contexts by 107 start-up companies in London. Our findings show that libraries owned by big-tech companies, product vendors, and communities coexist; that the deployment of big-tech libraries is unaffected by the scale of the deploying start-up; and that context evolution paths are consequential for library deployment. These findings portray a balanced picture of digital infrastructure as neither the community-based utopia of early open-source research nor the dystopia of the recent digital dominance literature.}

In this paper, we investigate how the operationalization of uncertainty in the model can be related to the disruption of social orders—societal pressures to adapt to ongoing environmental and technological change. First, we study the theoretical tradeoffs between three kinds of uncertainty as groups navigate external problems: validity (the predictability of the environment, including of other agents), coherence (the predictability of interpersonal affective dynamics), and dependence (the predictability of affective meanings). Second, we discuss how these uncertainty tradeoffs are related to contemporary political conflict and polarization in the context of societal transitions. To illustrate the potential of our model to analyze the socio-emotional consequences of uncertainty, we present a simulation of diverging individual affective meanings of occupational identities under uncertainty in a climate change mitigation scenario based on events in Germany. Finally, we sketch a possible research agenda to substantiate the novel, but yet mostly conjectural, ideas put forward in this paper.}

The authors make the case for combining an interactionist approach of media influence, which is centred on the effects of evidential claims, frames and agendas made by various actors over time, with greater sensitivity for the factors that make conflict cases so different. They argue that the specific role played by the media depends, chiefly: (a) on the ways in which it transforms conflict actors’ claims, interpretations and prescriptions into media content; and (b) their ability to amplify these contents and endow them with reach, visibility and consonance. They found significant variation in media roles across six conflict cases and suggest that they are best explained four interlocking conditioning factors: (i) the degree to which the media landscape is diverse and free, or conversely, controlled and instrumentalized by conflict parties; (ii) societal attitudes to and uses of different media by audiences; (iii) different degrees of conflict intensity and dynamics between the conflict parties; (iv) the degree and nature of the involvement of regional and international actors. The article maintains that de-escalatory media influence will be most effective over the longer term, in settings of low intensity conflict and when tailored carefully to local conditions.}

The proposed analysis seeks to make visible how both direct and indirect state action enables the different dimensions of the urban field to come together, become valuable and jointly constitute what Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have called the “metropolis”. In so doing, the article underlines that the different dimensions of the urban field figure prominently albeit differently partake in processes of extraction of knowledge value in monetised or sociocultural form. At the conceptual level, we critically engage with the existing literature on emergent forms of state capitalism by putting forward a governmental analytic on state power in contemporary urbanised knowledge capitalism. Empirically, we develop our arguments through two case studies. First, we examine the start-up unicorn Wolt, often considered as one of the national champion start-ups in Finland (together with a handful of mobile game developers). Second, we scrutinise the arrival of the Apple software developer Academy in Naples, a widely celebrated state-capital interaction in an economically struggling urban context in southern Italy. These cases are among the many that motivate one to re-think the entanglement of urban space, state governmentality and value extraction as it unfolds today in urbanised knowledge economies.}

The drive towards net-zero and more digital economies is manifested through the move from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars, engendering a reorganisation of production, work and employment among car manufacturers. We identified two strategic union response patterns. While German unions are developing proactive strategies and proposals to influence and shape the ongoing transition of the automotive industry, Belgian unions are more passive, reacting primarily to management proposals and focusing narrowly on employment and working conditions without a broader strategy on how to influence the transformation of the automotive industry. We explain the observed cross-national differences by two factors: the importance of national institutions, i.e., the varying integration of labour into management decision-making, and the role of union knowledge regimes. The latter refers to internal union organisations and structures such as research departments, research institutes and foundations tasked with providing own research and funding external research on change topics from a union perspective, publishing studies and developing programmatic agendas, and disseminating the knowledge to union members through training, workshops and conferences.}

Science fiction films in particular take advantage of new technologies and create new special effects that are incorporated into dystopian views on the relationship between man/woman and machine that fuses to create hybrid characters. The merger of cinema and computer, with its expanded representation of motion and space comparable to virtual reality settings, together with the characterisation of machines as evil, characterise the two dominant strategies of cinema’s response to new media. In a discussion of two films which at the time of their respective releases highlighted this double approach - Terminator 2 and The Matrix - I suggest that the struggle about space in both films transgresses the generic tradition of science fiction and responds to general disturbances in the temporal- spatial order in electronic culture. However, where the earlier Terminator 2 offers discourse, the later The Matrix turns entropic and regressive.}

Jointly building a community with a shared future in cyberspace can better deal with common network problems, explore the community of cyberspace conflict of cyberspace value, cyberspace security threatened, cyberspace interests game three main practical problems, and explore the benefits and value of cyberspace community for the members of the international community, form from promoting discussion, expand consensus, strengthen construction, seek to collaborative path innovation, can actively promote the effective governance of the global network.}

abstract = {Before the digital era, music consumption was limited to purchasing LPs, tapes and CDs, or attending concerts. With digitization and mobile technologies in tow, the consumption of music exploded. Music is now literally everywhere—but none of it is actually free. Our consumption of it on television and cable, through games on our computers and our phones, through subscriptions or sites with built-in never-ending streams of advertising always has a price. Music is everywhere, but how did this happen? How has digital distribution and production changed the recording industry? What are the consequences of ubiquitous music? In this article, I argue that the digital music trap is an outgrowth of digital capitalism that commodifies our everyday existence.}

A burgeoning body of research on the topic is emerging, and conceptual clarity is vital for this research to converge into a cumulative body of knowledge; the purpose of this article is to underline and address some of the conceptual clutter and ambiguities around the concept of fake news and situate it within its social context. To do so, we first discuss the problems with current terminology and conceptualisation, and then draw on recent developments on the ontology of digital objects and their attributes to shift the focus from fake news to false messages, a type of syntactic digital objects comprised of content and structure and characterised by attributes of editability, openness, interactivity, and distributedness. Then we expand this concept further by placing it within a network of actors and digital objects. Our analysis uncovers several areas of research that have been overlooked in the study of fake news.}

abstract = {How do paradoxical tensions become salient in organizations over time? Ambidexterity and paradox studies have, thus far, primarily focused on how tensions inside organizations are managed after they have been rendered salient for actors. Using a longitudinal, embedded case study of four strategic business units within a media organization, we theorize the role of the top management team leader’s practices in enabling tensions to become salient for their respective lower-level managers when there are initial differences in how tensions are interpreted across levels. Our findings extend a dynamic equilibrium model of organizing by adding interpretive context as an enabling condition that shapes the emergence of salience through the provision of a constellation of cues that guide sensemaking. Informed by a practice-based perspective on paradox, we also contribute a conceptual model of leadership as practice, and outline the implications for ambidexterity studies.}

It demonstrates that, despite the protracted conflict in eastern Ukraine, bilateral donors have preferred to address Ukraine’s decentralization from the governance reform perspective, rather than as a form of territorial self-governance (TSG) arrangement, linked to conflict resolution. They have also tended to “outsource” conflict-related support to multilateral organizations. This article explains the Russian Federation’s use of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “People’s Republics” as proxies in an international conflict and the contested nature of the role played by the Minsk Protocol in determining the form of support provided for reform. It concludes with insights into the implications of donor support for the decentralization reform in Ukraine for research on decentralization and other TSG solutions in conflict-affected contexts.}

Next, we applied several state-of-the-art bibliometric techniques, including co-citation and keyword co-occurrence analysis. Based on the results of co-occurrence analysis, we proposed a flowchart of the service innovation process combining organizational and customer perspectives while considering the service design, process, and outcome phases. We then summarized the major findings and limitations of service innovation studies in hospitality and tourism. A series of critical future research directions were presented accordingly.}

This is where essentially all interactions associated with the teaching and learning process are mediated via the online medium. Initially spurred on by technological innovation and a variety of socio-cultural forces, growth has more recently rapidly accelerated due to pandemic restrictions. Many suggest we are on the precipice of profound transformation in mathematics education, the outlines of which remain unknown. In leveraging online education possibilities and advancing online mathematics education, this paper considers aesthetic experiences associated with learning mathematics fully online. First, three assumptions are made to highlight the importance of these experiences. Second, three challenges are identified regarding the current state of fully online mathematics education. Finally, specific instructional design and online teaching strategies are outlined that potentiate experiences of wonder and beauty often associated with mathematical discovery. As its central theme, the paper seeks to answer how we may take advantage of this technology in delivering quality mathematics education without allowing it to diminish our human essence.}

Findings based on the data from 969 employees in Istanbul and Western Anatolia indicate that P–O fit is positively related and turnover intention negatively related to both psychological ownership and creative behavior, and that psychological ownership plays a full mediating role in these relations. Psychological ownership has a central role in employees’ creative behavior; it should thus be augmented together with its antecedents if managers wish to foster creative behaviors among their employees.}

During the nursing care services, elderly patients who live in the nursing homes require to be treated and consulted in a number of healthcare organisations, for example hospitals, mental health centres and rehabilitation centres. Currently, the data management for the elderly is relatively centralised to establish their own electronic medical records and protected health information without decision support functionalities. The community and healthcare industry are eager to develop a safe and comprehensive system to provide adequate healthcare services and monitoring to the elderly. In this study, an internet of healthcare things (IoHT)-based care link system (IoHT-CLS) is proposed, which provides a structured framework on integrating IoHT and artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a one-stop solution for managing elderly’s healthcare facilities. The elderly can be effectively linked into the integrated IoHT system by using various sensing and data collection technologies. The collected data are further processed by means of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and case-based reasoning to provide the functionalities of risk management and customised elderly service programmes for the elderly care institutions. Consequently, this study contributes to the healthcare management through the enhancement of service quality in the community.}

At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, during the spring 2020, patients that underwent DRF surgery had regular follow-ups replaced by video calls from their surgeon and physiotherapist. Afterward, patients answered questionnaires regarding health and digital literacy and took part in semistructured interviews regarding the experience of the virtual follow-up. By systemic text condensation, 2 major categories were identified: (1) The video call—new, but surprisingly simple: All but 1 found it easier than expected, and (2) Video calls—the patient’s choice: All but 1 patient preferred video calls to physical visits for follow-up. This is the first mixed methods study to assess patients’ experiences of digital follow-up after DRF surgery. This study indicates that digital follow-up was highly appreciated, even among patients with low levels of digital literacy. Digital technologies must be made suitable even for patients with inadequate levels of digital literacy.}

abstract = {The close relationship between the concepts of information systems and information technology creates issues for researchers. Usefully distinguishing between the concepts is problematic. We investigate the use of the systems concept in practice, finding a pragmatic distinction between an information system (IS) and an information technology system (IT system). In a practice view, an IS incorporates an emphasis on both a technical and a social subsystem, while an IT system predominantly emphasizes the technical elements. This distinction becomes useful in practice because contemporary IS practitioners are often involved in acquiring and integrating IT systems into an organizational IS. This involvement leads to a viewpoint on the organizational IS (including the social subsystem) as a nexus of multiple IT systems. This nexus creates issues in practice for not only integrating IT systems into the organizational IS, but also integrating multiple IT systems with each other in the context of the organizational IS. These issues lead to research opportunities such as the need for new methodologies for IT system acquisitions and new theories that accommodate the social integration of IT systems and IS.}

Using a structured survey instrument, data were collected from 285 respondents from four cosmopolitan cities in the southern part of India—Chennai, Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, and Madurai using a structured instrument. The hierarchical regression results reveal that (i) stress induced by COVID-19 was negatively related to work engagement, (ii) work orientation is positively associated with work engagement, and (iii) telecommuting is positively associated with work engagement. The results also reveal that (i) telecommuting weakened the relationship between stress induced by COVID-19 and work engagement and (ii) strengthened the positive relationship between work orientation and work engagement. These results are consistent with Job Demands and Resources (JDR), Conservation of Resources Theory (COR), and Career Construction Theory (CCT). The study highlights the importance of telecommuting as a strategic move on the part of the companies to reduce stress and enhance work engagement. Considering the global pandemic situation, employees in the IT sector would find it comfortable to work from their homes and contribute their best for the success of organizations. The present study also suggests ways for the organizations to promote work engagement and remain committed to performing during stressful situations like a global pandemic.

Methods We systematically searched PubMed database using sensitive search strings. Two reviewers independently conducted two-phase selection via title and abstract, followed by full-text appraisal. Consensuses were derived for any discrepancies. A standardized data extraction tool was used for reliable data mining. Results A total of 54 reviews from year 2014 to 2021 were included with notable increase in trend of publications. Systematic reviews constituted the majority (61.1%, (37.0% with meta-analyses)) followed by scoping reviews (38.9%). Domains of quality being reviewed include effectiveness (75.9%), accessibility (33.3%), patient safety (31.5%), efficiency (25.9%), patient-centred care (20.4%) and equity (16.7%). Mobile apps and computer-based were the commonest (79.6%) modalities. Strategies for effective intervention via digital health included engineering improved health behaviour (50.0%), better clinical assessment (35.1%), treatment compliance (33.3%) and enhanced coordination of care (24.1%). Psychiatry was the discipline with the most topics being reviewed for digital health (20.3%). Conclusion Digital health reviews reported findings that were skewed towards improving the effectiveness of intervention via mHealth applications, and predominantly related to mental health and behavioural therapies. There were considerable gaps on review of evidence on digital health for cost efficiency, equitable healthcare and patient-centred care. Future empirical and review studies may investigate the association between fields of practice and tendency to adopt and research the use of digital health to improve care.}

abstract = {This paper presents an on-board multi-sensor system which is able to detect obstacles and estimate their distances in railway scenes in different illumination conditions. The system was developed within the H2020 Shift2Rail project SMART (Smart Automation of Rail Transport) and aims at increasing the safety of rail transport by detecting obstacles on the rail tracks ahead of a moving train in order to reduce the number of collisions. The system hardware consists of cameras of different types integrated into a specially designed housing, mounted on the front of the train. Multiple vision sensors complement each other in order to handle different illumination and environmental conditions. The system software uses a novel machine learning-based method that is suited to a particular challenge of railway operations, the need for long-range obstacle detection and distance estimation. The development of this method used a long-range railway dataset, which was specifically generated for this project. Evaluation results of reliable obstacle detection in various environmental conditions using the SMART RGB camera in day light illumination conditions and using the SMART Night Vision sensor in poor (night) illumination conditions are presented. The results demonstrate both the potential of the on-board SMART obstacle detection system in the operational railway environment and the benefit of the use of different cameras to be more independent of light and environmental conditions.}

In this time, the number of digital media outlets has steadily increased to become the most abundant type of media in the 2020s, ahead of print, radio and television. Based on a quantitative analysis of the authors’ own database of active digital media outlets (n = 2726) and an examination of Spain’s technological, sociopolitical and economic development in recent decades, this article identifies several factors that have spurred the evolution of digital journalism in Spain. The study results show a correlation in the period from 1994 to 2020 between the percentage of Internet users and the number of active digital media outlets, which showed very similar progress. The study also detects a relationship between the country’s economic evolution and the expansion of digital media, albeit with a seemingly paradoxical effect: digital media, especially digital native media companies, proliferated even more when the economy was at its worst. The article highlights the subtle effects of political factors on the development of digital media in the period under study, although increasing political polarization has triggered additional transformation processes in recent years.}

abstract = {This article examines, within China’s complex healthcare sector, the extent to which China’s legal frameworks can adapt to a data-driven context that requires the reconciliation of public and private interests for the use of health data. Current data-processing mechanisms operate through individual consent, and administrative authorisation in mobile health settings are insufficient and ineffective to meet societal needs while simultaneously protecting individuals’ interests. In light of this shift of regulation from individual control to collective governance, this article argues that the principle of the right to health may complement this collective governance model. The right to health principle emphasises solidarity, justice, confidentiality, and collective responsibility, which may balance power asymmetries in the use of health data among different stakeholders. The article proposes a solution that incorporates the state’s obligation with private actors’ responsibilities, while stressing the importance of data sharing and the fair use of health data.}

It encapsulates clashes between digital and legacy journalism, challenges posed by and responses to technologies in the media industry. It differs from aggregation news elsewhere because of dynamic media environment in China. This ethnographic study closely analyzes manifestations of “un-news” churned out by digital aggregators who have to work under management of legacy print journalists and editors in a local Chinese press. The hierarchy of influences model is used to decompose the meanings and complexities of “un-news.” Fieldwork observations have confirmed our expectations that the hierarchy model remains structurally valid, although the content and meaning of influence have changed drastically within each level.}

abstract = {EU management of migration is undergoing an unprecedented transformation because of the use of databases and information systems. Drawing on the concept of border performativity, this article discusses how data is transforming the border. In particular, the article focuses on 1) how the EU JHA databases are evolving, from separate systems each with one purpose to multi-purpose databases, and 2) how the new EU plan – the interoperability regulation – connects and merges biometric and biographical data, as part of a shift from a silo-based approach towards a single centralised information system. The article – based on results of several research projects carried out between 2011 and 2019 adopting mixed methodology – discusses the border crossers’ role in challenging this digital border control, both in light of the current practices of data collection and processing and newly approved EU regulations. The article argues that the transformation of border control practices into practices driven by data processing makes it more difficult for border crossers to manoeuvre the system and legally challenge decisions based on data processing, thus, hampering the transformation of the border from below.}

Nordea has deployed numerous software robots, for a wide range of business processes, from transaction-processing work and both internal and external reporting all the way to interaction with end users in handling of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-related queries. The scene is set with a meeting where three people discuss the current state of robotic process automation implementation at Nordea: Group Head of Robotics Agnieszka Belowska Gosławska, Head of Robotic Process Automation Operations Piotr Stolarczyk and Acting Head of Robotics Execution Jaroslaw Motylewski. The presentation outlines several governance-related issues and decision points that must be addressed in connection with any deployment of robotic process automation at somewhat large scale within a company. The key issues are related to the software’s development and maintenance, robotic process automation governance and IT infrastructure. Students who have worked through the case should be able to (1) describe archetypal and hybrid governance modes for robotic process automation and (2) evaluate their advantages and disadvantages for solid infrastructure and effective software development and maintenance.}

By drawing on the notion of platform affordances and data collected from mixed methods centered on the analysis of primary and secondary data, we contend that microcommerce embodies Weixin’s structural (political economy) and cultural (social lives and norms) qualities in China. While microcommerce might have emerged from Weixin’s ecosystem, which is defined by corporate interest and state’s regulatory power, the practice of microcommerce is embedded within the traditional Chinese notion of shuren guanxi (familiar, non-stranger social relational) networks. This article puts forward a sociomaterial approach as a possible conceptual complement to the existing political economy approach of platform studies to call for greater attention to the intersection and interaction between the structural arrangements and social conditions of platform media.}

abstract = {It has been a common assumption in sociology that the usefulness of knowledge on “the social” is largely dependent on its ability to offer a truthful, complete and reliable account of social life. However, the efforts to produce instrumental social knowledge or to establish the “applied sociology” have often been viewed as hindered by such difficulties as the overwhelming complexity of social phenomena and the alleged epistemological “deficiencies” of the social sciences. This article starts by revisiting these arguments as underpinned by the representational understanding of knowledge as “the mirror of the world”, and then draws on social studies of science to articulate a different, pragmatic and translational understanding of knowledge as “a tool”. The two analytical views are then employed to account for the practical success of so-called user experience research – a relatively new and increasingly popular domain of the production of social knowledge to be used in the process of designing digital products like mobile apps and services. The article argues that the usefulness of knowledge generated in this field cannot be attributed to its epistemological superiority or theoretical edge, but rather to maximising the ability to engage, provoke understanding, foster collaboration and create action possibilities for the specific recipients of knowledge. These effects are achieved by simplifying the analytical framework and loosening methodological rigour, but also by offering innovative methods of articulation of research results and benefiting from the generative capabilities of knowledge. The article concludes by outlining the complex consequences of the translational and pragmatic approach to producing social knowledge.}

However, much remains to be learned about how salespeople are utilizing social media in an international context. This multi-method, multi-study design contributes to international sales research by showing how business-to-business (B2B) salespeople use social media whether they are in a multinational or local firm. With a social capital lens, the authors explore the importance of social media in regards to strengthening salespeople’s internal and external connections in an international context. In Study 1, with 131 B2B salespeople, salespeople use social media to develop customer relations (i.e., external connections) to engage in positive publicity and social media advocacy, ultimately leading to sales performance. Specifically, social media advocacy enhances sales performance only for salespeople in multinationals. In Study 2, with twenty-three qualitative interviews, the authors contextualize the findings of Study 1 by comparing social media use amongst salespeople in MNEs and local firms. The basis of the exploration involves internal and external connections with the three dimensions of social capital: structural, relational, and cognitive. The authors demonstrate that internal connections with peers on social media allows for increased knowledge transfer and other benefits.}

Individuals on the wrong side of the digital divide are often older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), such as “old–old” adults, who often have various functional impairments. To shed light on the initial situation shortly before the pandemic, three data sources from Switzerland were used in this study to answer the following questions: (1) Do older adults want to have internet access if and/or when they move into a LTCF? (2) What form does ICT use take (specifically internet, smartphone, and tablet use) among LTCF residents, and what need do they have for ICT support? (3) What is the state of LTCFs’ ICT infrastructure and residents’ level of involvement in the decision-making process related to acquiring new technologies? Community-dwelling older adults in this study reported a desire to have internet access when moving into LTCFs, and 21% of LTCF residents reported using the internet just before the pandemic began. Internet access and ICT infrastructure in LTCFs, in general, are both limited, however, and LTCF managers seldom involve older adults in the ICT decision-making process. While modern ICT usage has reached the long-term care sector, the results of this study show that compensating for a lack of physical social contacts by relying on digital solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be the sole solution. The current pandemic has reminded us that a digital gap exists and that non-use of ICTs during the pandemic can produce additional feelings of social isolation.}

abstract = {One of the most widespread types of digital technology is the Internet which more than 5 billion people or 63.1% of the world’s population use as of April 2022. Previous studies have established that the relationship between digital technologies, such as the Internet, and labour market participation is worth investigating. While it is widely accepted that digital technologies help in women’s social and economic inclusion, the female labour participation force observed across countries remains slow and varied. There remains a limited investigation into the influence of internet penetration on the changes in the labour market outcomes for women. There is also scope for research on how the Internet affects women’s economic participation from a social and gender perspective. Prior research shows that social capital has been linked to labour allocation. Studies also show that variations in ideas on gender roles are significant for women’s decisions to find employment. We, therefore, investigate how widespread penetration of the Internet has influenced the economic participation of women in this study. We also investigate how social capital and gender equality play a role in the above relationship across countries. Our study uses archival data to conduct a panel analysis of 66 countries from 2014 to 2021. The study’s results show that the penetration of internet and the economic participation of women are positively associated. This study also found that the link between the penetration of internet and the economic participation of women is mediated by social capital. Gender equality was also found to moderate the above relationship, such that social capital had a stronger mediation influence on the association between internet penetration and women’s economic engagement in nations with comparatively lower levels of gender equality.}

It concludes that internal weaknesses, such as insufficient political will to promote OS, dominate other SWOT characteristics of Korea’s national OS approach.

This article examines the nascent field of “urban robotics” in three emblematic yet diverse national-urban contexts that are leading centres for urban robotic experimentation. Focusing on the experimental application of autonomous social robots, the article explores: (i) the rationale for urban robotic experiments and the interests involved, and (ii) the challenges and outcomes of creating meaningful urban spaces for robotic experimentation. The article makes a distinctive contribution to urban research by illuminating a potentially far-reaching but under-researched area of urban policy. It provides a conceptual framework for mapping and understanding the highly contingent, spatially uneven and socially selective processes of robotic urban experimentation.}

Furthermore, the automatization of the segmentation methods for lung alterations helps to speed up the diagnosis and lighten radiologists’ workload. Considering the assiduous pathology monitoring, ultra-low dose (ULD) chest CT protocols have been implemented to drastically reduce the radiation burden. Unfortunately, the available AI technologies have not been trained on ULD-CT data and validated and their applicability deserves careful evaluation. Therefore, this work aims to compare the results of available AI tools (BCUnet, CORADS AI, NVIDIA CLARA Train SDK and CT Pneumonia Analysis) on a dataset of 73 CT examinations acquired both with conventional dose (CD) and ULD protocols. COVID-19 volume percentage, resulting from each tool, was statistically compared. This study demonstrated high comparability of the results on CD-CT and ULD-CT data among the four AI tools, with high correlation between the results obtained on both protocols (R > .68, P < .001, for all AI tools).}

Many of the important impacts of this project of creating larger and more integrated systems of “behavioural surplus” are captured powerfully by Zuboff; yet as different risk and organisational scholars such as Beck, Perrow, and Vaughan have argued, integrated systems often do not function as intended. While the imperfection of these systems may raise the possibility that surveillance capitalism may not be as bad as Zuboff suggests, there is also a way in which these systems not functioning as intended can make surveillance capitalism an even more dystopian possibility. In this vein, this paper asks: what are the consequences when the tools of a surveillance capitalist society break down? This paper argues that it is by thinking through Zuboff’s framework that we can identify the systemic fragility of a surveillance capitalist society. This systemic fragility emerges through how surveillance capitalism generates imperatives towards the maximal collection of data for exploitation, which in turn generates a corresponding imperative to connect all aspects of life. Both of these imperatives, of collect and connect, in turn create an immensely fragile digital system, which has vast ramifications throughout social life, such that small imperfections and gaps in the system can magnify risk throughout society.}

We put forward the idea of continuous operation monitoring and simple reporting to make this trade experience as efficient and peaceful as possible. To validate the practicality of the idea, we choose pre-owned passenger vehicles as the target use-case. In the last several years, the market for secondhand car sales has grown a lot, due to its affordability and rising new car prices, thus, giving it a larger share of the overall car market’s value. The used car trade is usually a time-consuming, stressful, and fraud-prone process. In this paper, we propose a system, which is a novel concept rather than technology, to represent the treatment history of a car simply with two scores, denoting the mechanical and the body treatments, using the electronic control unit and other add-on sensors’ information. These scores are cyclically and wirelessly transmitted to and recorded in a data center to be fetched at a later time. The two treatment scores alongside the production year, the mileage, the vehicle history reports, and online marketplace valuations provide buyers with comfort and peace of mind in choosing a used car.}

It offers a reflection upon whether Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) could be a key notion for the commons discourse which centers around stakeholders, self-organization, and a rights-based framework. By decentralizing ledgers and enabling the interoperability of the various interfaces, DLTs make records more accessible, exchanges more transparent, and reduce costs while increasing efficiency, and permit automation, therefore commoning interactions both offline and online are facilitated. We argue that the use of DLTs to preserve the spatiotemporal integrity of key urban spaces is a common value question that needs to be elucidated or renegotiated in order to provide any useful guidance to DLTs integrity-preserving potential. In doing so, we draw attention to DLT-based urban commons and urban governance, and point to inherent incompatibilities that may lead to radical and not-so-smooth changes in urban institutions, while providing a way of thinking which can move the smart city closer towards a values-centered process and away from a preoccupation with technology and efficiency.}

abstract = {This article explores the chili pepper industry in Guizhou and how it intersects with a push toward high-tech, digital agriculture schemes as part of Guizhou’s economic development driven by a data economy. State bureaus, tech companies, and research institutes around rural development cast digital, data-driven agriculture as a broadly positive development that will provide environmental sustainability and economic benefits to small farmers. In examining Guizhou’s Chili Pepper City, I argue that such initiatives maintain state power through accelerating complexity and implementation of universalizing technologies. In the context of Guizhou, these universalizing technologies are intertwined with a legacy of China’s own settler dynamics, the political uses of poverty alleviation and environmentalism to control land, and socialist legacies of using agricultural modernization toward nationalist ends. I draw on a multitude of news articles, journals, and secondary sources, as well as repeat site visits and interviews that I conducted in Guizhou from 2017 to 2019.}

Outside of entrepreneurship, though, research on how passion may be activated within a work role has been limited. As frontline employees (FLEs) are a vital link between organizations and their customers, measuring passion in the FLE context is particularly relevant. Anyone who has enjoyed memorable service knows, it is through passionate FLEs that service organizations may stand out from competitors. Through a series of seven studies conducted across multiple countries, this research develops and validates a measure of FLE passion. FLE passion is the intense positive feelings and identity reinforcement resulting from solving problems and/or serving customers. The developed and validated measurement instrument is comprised of both serving and solving dimensions and includes evidence that FLEs negotiate their identities and activate positive affect during service encounters. Theory and results indicate that organizations may control certain antecedents to passion, and that passion is related, yet distinct, from such things as employee engagement and organizational commitment. A potential research agenda is presented based upon applying the FLE passion construct across various service domains.}

The project faced considerable challenges, including a highly constrained market environment, time and cost constraints, and a multiyear organization transformation with a diverse mix of stakeholder objectives. Despite these challenges, the project was brought in under budget and on schedule, achieving other objectives that often seem at odds with each other (best-in-class sustainability ratings, quality scores from customers, and with a remarkably low number of change requests). We found that significant stakeholder engagement early in the architect and contractor selection process leads to the right contract management process and ultimately successful outcomes. A key insight from this case involves the need for differentiated supplier relationship management for procurement-project team integration.}

The flexible manufacturing system performance greatly depends on the performance of the material transportation system. As a mobile robot controlled by a central controller, an automated guided vehicle has a strong ability for material transportation. This article studies a dynamic scheduling problem in a shop floor, where machines and automated guided vehicles run at a specified speed and specifies a mathematical model for the dynamic scheduling problem with the goal of makespan minimization. Meanwhile, inspired by the hormone secretion principle of the endocrine system, a bio-inspired scheduling optimization approach is developed to solve the dynamic scheduling problem in the flexible manufacturing system. To verify its practical application, the bio-inspired scheduling optimization approach and other scheduling approaches are tested, and the results illustrate that the bio-inspired scheduling optimization approach has better scheduling performance as well as optimizes the quality of integrated and real-time scheduling of machines and automated guided vehicles.}

To appreciate these changes, it is important to maintain theoretical interchange between developments in financial geography and economic geography, its parent discipline. In this paper, we argue that the ways in which evolutionary economic geography impacts strategic coupling in global financial networks are crucial to grasp tomorrow’s geographies of Fintech. Through an in-depth examination of Brussels, we analyse the potential of Fintech opening a window of locational opportunity in financial services. Belgium has put together a strategy to seize this window by leveraging its politically neutral image and Brussels’ existing niche in financial collaboration and infrastructural plumbing. The latter status is exemplified by the presence of global players SWIFT and Euroclear. We analyse how Belgian entrepreneurs and politicians assess Brussels’ locational resources, and strategically couple big financial institutions with small tech startups in order to cultivate a Fintech ecosystem in the service of incumbent finance, constituting a Fin-Tech-State triangle. As such, we document and analyse how the coalescence of finance and technology offers new opportunities for second-tier financial centres, while highlighting the difficulties in reaping these in practice.}

Social media allows companies to interact directly with customers via various Internet platforms and monitor and interact with customer opinions and evaluations of services. This exploratory article studies the travel portion of the tourism experience through airlines’ use of social media on two social media platforms for a 6-month time period. The social media content posted by airlines is analyzed and categorized according to the promotional marketing mix. In addition, the authors propose four categories to describe the overall communicative behavior. Among the results, it is shown that there is a lack of strategic perspective among airlines’ utilization of social media as it is being used with limited uniformity. These findings may aid marketing departments in their marketing and social media communication strategies, while complementing current marketing research.}

This paper studies the coincidence of the two main culture–based urban development strategies and its implications in the same physical urban place. Drawing on geospatial mapping techniques and archival data, we aim to illustrate how the two cultural urban redevelopment strategies manifest and interact in urban space. We find that stakeholders draw on each strategy to counteract the excesses of the other, given their different aims and audiences, so as to regulate the interaction between the two and achieve balance among competing interests in the neighborhood.}

It offers a reflection upon whether Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) could be a key notion for the commons discourse which centers around stakeholders, self-organization, and a rights-based framework. By decentralizing ledgers and enabling the interoperability of the various interfaces, DLTs make records more accessible, exchanges more transparent, and reduce costs while increasing efficiency, and permit automation, therefore commoning interactions both offline and online are facilitated. We argue that the use of DLTs to preserve the spatiotemporal integrity of key urban spaces is a common value question that needs to be elucidated or renegotiated in order to provide any useful guidance to DLTs integrity-preserving potential. In doing so, we draw attention to DLT-based urban commons and urban governance, and point to inherent incompatibilities that may lead to radical and not-so-smooth changes in urban institutions, while providing a way of thinking which can move the smart city closer towards a values-centered process and away from a preoccupation with technology and efficiency.}

abstract = {The European Union is broadly considered a benign reform actor, encouraging and supporting reforms in member states and beyond. However, European Union-induced reforms do not only generate the intended effects; they can also trigger unintended consequences for other reforms. These unintended consequences occur primarily through the impact of European Union-induced reforms on the resources available. The scope and size of the unintended effects will be conditioned by the domestic cycles in economic and public policy-making. Here, we apply our analytical framework to study the resilience of governance reforms in Greece during the period of fiscal consolidation (2010–2015), highlighting the unintended consequences of the European Union’s “reform actorness”. We find that the distinction between financial and non-financial resources is critical in unpacking the unintended consequences of any exogenously driven reform. Depending on the current stage in the cycles, the impact on non-financial resources can generate positive side-effects that help prevent other ongoing domestic reforms being derailed.}

The theoretical framework consisted of a practice theory approach coupled with analytical concepts from information infrastructure studies. The findings highlighted how teachers and librarians collaborate closely in schools with designated best practice libraries. Members of both professions collaborated in teaching and interdisciplinary projects and were supported by management teams at the schools under study. However, the librarians expressed a disconnect between themselves and the teachers and leaders of the school. This disconnect was evidenced by a lack of planning practices and classroom teaching, impelling the librarians to advocate continuously for better awareness and visibility of their practices. The article offers insights into school librarian practices at sites that function simultaneously as both workplaces for professionals with multiple competencies and educational settings for students.}

Concerning level of analysis, our results indicate a decreasing trend toward macro (organizational) studies. Finally, we note a lack of positive significant trends in the publication of special issue articles, review articles, and meta-analytic studies.

There is no doubt the COVID-19 crisis has widened existing, deep cracks in the news media industry. In response this article sets out to explore possible solutions and strategies for local newspapers in the post-pandemic media landscape. We take an analogical approach to argue some of the issues that emerged during COVID-19 and strategies used to fight the global health pandemic also present valuable lessons for the preservation of public interest journalism and news at the local level. We conceptualise five coronavirus-related themes that resonate with a much-needed innovations agenda for local newspapers in Australia: (1) support for essential services, (2) warnings of complacency against an evolving biological threat, (3) appreciating the power of the social (4) coordinated government/policy responses and (5) “we are all in this together”.}

Optical density is integrated within each strip, strips are assembled into a density profile and the definitive centromere is located at the major local minimum in the profile. Centromeric index (large arm:total) is based on optical density or area. A test set of 4611 chromosomal images is based on over 2500 chromosomes (56 metaphase cells from six individuals) and excludes overlapped and excessively bent chromosomes. The program fails in 1.2% of the test images. Standard deviation within chromosome groups of centromeric index based on density is 0.024 and replication error is 0.016. Systematic differences between area-based and density-based measurements are observed and interpreted.}

abstract = {There is no escaping the Big Data hype. Vendors are peddling Big Data solutions; consulting firms employ Big Data specialists; Big Data conferences are aplenty. There is a rush to extract golden nuggets (of insight) from mountains (of data). By focusing merely on the mountain (of Big Data), these adventurers are overlooking the source of the revolution—namely, the many digital data streams (DDSs) that create Big Data—and the opportunity to improve real-time decision making. This article discusses the characteristics of DDSs, describes their common structure, and offers guidelines to enable firms to profit from their untapped potential.}

abstract = {Neotraditional organizations are those that exist to sustain indigenous cultures, practices, and institutions as they compete in modern markets. This study examines how a single mechanism, leader transparency, influences change outcomes in neotraditional organizations. We predict that leader transparency will enhance employee cognition- and affect-based trust toward leadership during times of change, thereby supporting relational dynamics within the organization that enable a smooth transition. We also predict that leader transparency will elevate employee acceptance of new technology during change, thereby enhancing desired functional adjustments within the organization. Finally, we predict that leaders who embrace the indigenous heritage of the firm while implementing change will benefit more from being transparent than leaders who ignore the indigenous heritage of the firm. We find overall support for our predictions. These results enhance our understanding of how leaders of neotraditional organizations can manage change successfully while preserving historical cultures, practices, and institutions.}
