abstract = {One of the most pressing issues affecting people worldwide is the accessibility of financial services in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. While peoples' adoption of technological advancements has spiraled over time, the acceptance of Fintech services edged up for instilling resilience during the pandemic. Hence, the study aims at exhuming the Fintech adoption for sustainable financial inclusion among young undergraduate users through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. To test the model, the researchers obtained data from 375 undergrads. The study adopted the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach in AMOS software to examine the determinants that affect the users to embrace Fintech services. The findings revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly influence the students' intention to use Fintech, whereas, the users’ facilitating condition and behavioral purposes positively influence them to use the financial technology. Interestingly, the social influence and personal innovativeness did not affect their intention to accept and adopt Fintech. Therefore, the study results will help explore the expectations, preferences, and actual level of use of Fintech among undergraduates and contribute to the escalation of Fintech use, leading to sustainable financial inclusion.}

The study's sample covers the years between 2006 and 2017 and contains 1677 country-year observations. The results of fixed effect analysis indicate that the six proxies for governments’ long-term vision and the digitalization of government services all play a significant role in alleviating tax evasion. Moreover, ICT adoption by society and citizens positively moderates the association between the digitalization of government services and tax evasion; that is, the digitalization of government services has a stronger effect on mitigating tax evasion in countries where ICT adoption is higher. The study suggests several implications for leveraging ICT in public service delivery, which may help countries reduce tax evasion and increase tax revenue. Specifically, public authorities should improve e-government structures and e-filing systems to facilitate taxpayers’ income tax declarations and payments.}

We demonstrate that container shipping lines have developed a very strong focus on market shares and on the lowering of the cost base by ordering ultra large vessels and by focusing on horizontal integration. The increasing “commoditization” of the liner shipping market and low margins are urging shipping lines to consider other growth strategies and revenue models by focusing on supply chain integration/vertical integration, digital transformation and by aiming for zero emission ships. These transformation processes within container shipping lines are not easy, given the weak financial base of most companies.}

Further, we examine whether customer-focused strategies, such as Experience-Based Offerings (EBOs), provide the best solution for financial service firms to gain competitive advantage. The findings show that strategies can be implemented successfully by integrating technology to improve, personalize, and customize customer experiences, while managers and employees can add quality to experiences. This study contributes to our understanding of business platforms by identifying how they are designed and managed, and how incumbents can learn from them to respond to the challenges presented by today’s rapidly changing consumer behavior.

abstract = {The exponential increase in data produced over the last two decades has revolutionized the way we collect, store, process, analyze, model, and interpret information to improve profitability. Manufacturing is no exception. However, Smart Manufacturing, the digital practice, organization, workforce, and infrastructure transformation for collection and deployment of data and models at scale and at all levels of manufacturing, is a complex, costly, and labor-intensive journey that is still seeing slow adoption. The Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), a national Manufacturing USA public-private partnership sponsored by the Department of Energy, is addressing this scaled use of data and modeling in manufacturing. CESMII has focused on how to collect and use operating data for numerous applications that improve productivity, precision, and performance of manufacturing operations from factory floor to supply chain using process simulation, predictive analytics, monitoring and control, and real-time optimization. Because contextualized data are key, CESMII has developed the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform (SMIP) to lower the barriers to the data that are needed to accelerate data-based model building, improve data visualization, and more quickly gain insights. Reusable, standards-based ways of doing data collection, ingestion, and contextualization are particularly important for scaling access and use of data. The SMIP uses a standards-based definition and construct for reusable information models called an SM Profile. When an SM Profile is used in conjunction with the SMIP, the SMIP ensures the availability of contextualized, operational data for model building. The present work demonstrates Smart Manufacturing and the application of the SMIP for building several data-centered models for the operation and control of an experimental electrochemical reactor that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to valuable liquid and gas chemicals, such as alcohols, olefins, and syngas. We describe how the SMIP plays a central role in more effective model building and we demonstrate how the electochemical reactor can be controlled and optimized for the desired products. Use of the SMIP involves the transmission of real-time sensor measurements to a cloud resource so that the operating data are available to all model building experts. The data collection and transmission process is fully automated to greatly reduce the need for manual manipulation of the data. Data-driven machine learning models are used for advanced real-time state estimation, real-time optimization, and model-based feedback control for the reactor. The application models are implemented as a system to monitor the data flow and control the electrochemical reactor with a single visualization interface. SM Profiles are used to demonstrate reusability of the information models for the reactor and the instrumentation. The application packages, algorithms, and user interfaces developed are cast as Docker images in a library to facilitate reusability of the application models.}

abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to investigate the current status of the workplace, its evolution during COVID-19, and the impact of the pandemic on the new (next) normal. This follows previous research about changes in the workplace influenced by the pandemic. Documents, publications, and surveys from numerous sources have been analysed to discover more about the experience of employees and organizations with remote working and the advantages and disadvantages of accessing the workplace during the pandemic and in the new (next) normal. The paper has two objectives, the first of which is to explore some indicators based on available data sources that can help to understand and, in some way, measure the workplace changes in the context of COVID-19. The second is to extend the previous analysis, using the same timeline framework, by studying the workplace during and after COVID-19.
Structure
First, the introduction explains the main basis of the research and the principal data sources, outlining what is known, what is new, and the aim of the paper. Then the research methodology is explained, along with the criteria by which the datasets were selected, and the results for the indicators outcomes. Finally, the concluding section highlights the findings obtained, their implications, the limitations of the study, and suggested future lines of research.
Findings
The analysis provides insight into to employees' and organizations' experience with remote working and the advantages and disadvantages of accessing the workplace during the pandemic. The indicators identified can allow a better understanding of the environment and, especially, a deeper knowledge of the new normal situation under COVID-19.
Discussion
In previous studies, certain strategic categories were identified in the process of reimagining the workplace after COVID-19. Those strategic categories supported the conclusion that there were several common company policies which, translated into practical action, could help in people's engagement with their work. These policies can be summarized as redesigning the physical space of the workplace, work flexibility, family reconciliation, and health security. The study of these policies, based on data analysis, may open up different research paths and allow us to establish models directly related to employee satisfaction.
Originality
The paper continues a previous line of research on the situation in the workplace by incorporating certain indicators that allow its measurement and, above all, its evolution over time, especially during the time of the new (next) normal, and by investigating the current status and future evolution of the workplace in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the data made possible the identification of patterns within the available literature regarding recent events and, especially, their influence on the workplace. This has led to the development of indicators in a range of categories.
Practical implications
The revolution initiated by COVID-19 has changed the way companies and employees work, which has involved a constant reinvention of the way they operate and provoked previously unseen actions and profound changes in the workplace. Therefore, the idea of the workplace will never again be what it was expected to be was before COVID-19, and it will be very different from that in the new (next) normal. The strategic categories and their indicators developed here are considered important for people's engagement with their workplaces and organizations. The processes adopted by firms must facilitate the redesign of the workplace in accordance with the new forms of work and not act as a mere copy or transfer of the usual approaches to remote work. Providing answers to the questions involved, and deepening the classifications of the categories we develop, can help us understand how people can be connected with the newest forms of workplaces. Some categories and their associated indicators are relevant in remote work and home office environments created by COVID-19. Given that the research started within a pandemic that has not yet ended, while we now know a lot more, the near-term future is uncertain.}

Using a structured survey questionnaire, the data was collected from 280 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which operate in both the service and manufacturing industries in Finland. Four developed hypotheses were tested using the regression analysis to find the relationship between digital business strategy, sustainability strategy and financial performance. The findings suggest that a sustainability strategy serves as a promoter in the relation between managerial capability and financial performance but inhibits the relation between operational capability and financial performance.}

One key issue faced by port authorities is to identify ships of higher risk accurately. This study aims to address the ship selection issue by first developing two data-driven ship risk prediction frameworks using features the same as or derived from the current ship selection scheme. Both frameworks are empirically shown to be more efficient than the current ship selection method. Like existing ship risk prediction models, the proposed frameworks are of black-box nature whose working mechanism is opaque. To improve model explainability, local explanation of the prediction of individual ships by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is provided. Furthermore, we innovatively extend the local SHAP model to a near linear-form global surrogate model which is fully-explainable. This demonstrates that the behavior of black-box data-driven models can be as interpretable as white-box models while retaining their prediction accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the white-box global surrogate models can accurately show the behavior of the original black-box models, shedding light on model validation, fairness verification, and prediction explanation. This study makes the very first attempt in the maritime transport area to quantitatively explain the rationale of black-box prediction models from both local and global perspectives, which facilitates the application of data-driven models and promotes the digital transformation of the traditional shipping industry.}

While these represent initial benefits from the digitalization of the process, a recurring evaluation and optimization of the process are required to sustain and improve process efficiency. For both non-digitalized and digitalized processes, the challenges for process owners are comparable. However, for digitalized processes, convenient tools facilitate process modifications. Particularly no-code digitalized processes exploit the opportunity for quick and agile process adaption with low efforts but require a structured and systematic method to ensure a quality-driven approach. This paper conceptualizes a rule-based decision support model for process improvement that takes advantage of digital traces recorded during process execution of digitalized processes. On the one hand, process mining techniques support data analysis and assist the extraction of process performance indicators as precursors to predict low process performance. On the other hand, process experts compile a list of recommendations for action in workshops and interviews to counteract low process efficiency. The approach to rule-based decision support developed in the scope of this research merges these two dimensions and constitutes an assistive tool for the continuous improvement of digitalized processes. Initial results of the model in practical application support this assessment and demonstrate further research needs.}

We surveyed seventy-three (73) organizations, collected 267 usable responses and applied structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques to analyze the data. The paper offers two contributions. First, we utilize the affordances-in-practice perspective to identify and categorize organizational practices enacted on social media, including functional, symbolic, and interactive practices.

Traditional two-dimensional (2D) maps are, therefore, increasingly inadequate to support effective management of the city. To address the issue, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) leads a whole-of-government (WHOG) initiative to create and maintain a geometrically accurate three-dimensional (3D) national topographic map and high-quality 3D datasets that capture fundamental as-built 3D information of buildings, terrain, and roads. These datasets serve as the authoritative base map which can be shared across government agencies to satisfy the increasing needs of government and agencies in smart operation, development planning, policymaking, and risk management. This chapter introduces the technological innovations that have been adopted to make changes in multiagency collaboration, as well as making a difference in the city experience of Singapore for social innovation. As a case study, the chapter explores the drivers, actors, and innovative aspects of developing a web-based geospatial platform integrating different 2D and 3D data and models. The platform integrates an intelligent environment decision support system (IEDSS) and a quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST) to facilitate citizen-based and multiagency collaboration in urban planning, design, and resource allocation.}

Business operations are undergoing drastic changes due to the disruptive effects of technology innovations; however, there is insufficient knowledge regarding the acceptability and consequences of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) in the education sector. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study explores the readiness of the education sector for 4IR. We adopted face-to-face semi-structured interviews to explore the views of 33 key stakeholders in the education sector, to understand the readiness and acceptability of 4IR in the sector. Findings show that the education sector, especially in Africa, is unprepared for 4IR, although there are indications for opportunities to harness the potential of the much-anticipated 4IR. Moreover, our study demonstrates a mutual symbiotic relationship between the education sector and technology innovations. The findings show that 4IR can facilitate students’ learning experience and transforms the workplace, although there is a need to assess the learning environment, to understand the facilitators and barriers to 4IR diffusion. The findings indicate the opportunity for the education sector to harness the innovations associated with 4IR through research and teaching to enhance learners’ experience; however, this may require a significant improvement in education curricula, as well as investments. The findings contribute to the theory and practice of technology in education and the limited literature on 4IR in the education sector, particularly in Africa.}

The research model has extracted variables from the widely accepted Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) alongside privacy, lifestyles, self-efficacy and trust. Required data were collected from mHealth apps users in Bangladesh. Firstly, this study confirmed that performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation and privacy exerted a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, trust and lifestyle had an influence on both behavioral intention and actual usage behavior. Secondly, the Neural Network Model was employed to rank relatively significant predictors obtained from structural equation modeling (SEM). This study contributes to the growing literature on the use of mHealth apps in trying to elevate the quality of patients' lives. The new methodology and findings from this study will significantly contribute to the extant literature of technology adoption and mHealth apps adoption intention especially. Therefore, for practitioners concerned with fostering mHealth apps adoption, the findings stress the importance of adopting an integrated approach centered on key findings of this study.}

Accordingly, this study aims at developing and empirically validating an integrated model of smart government usage by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) through the incorporation of a set of determinants and outcomes of smart government usage following an extensive review of extant literature. The data were obtained from 414 smart government clients in the United Arab Emirates through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of this study indicated that, among all significant antecedents of smart government usage, performance expectancy has the strongest impact, whilst facilitating conditions has the weakest influence. It has been also reported that personalization has no significant effect on smart government usage. The results further revealed that the strongest impact of smart government usage is on information transparency. Implications for theory and practice are also offered.}

abstract = {Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic had a major effect on teaching and learning. This study aimed to describe a range of teaching, learning, and assessment strategies related to radiography education which have become more common due to the pandemic through a narrative literature review.
Key findings
Educational change in radiography was accelerated by the disruption caused by the pandemic. Changes included the site and mode of teaching and conducting of assessment. While some of the digital transformation trends were introduced before the pandemic, others were further amplified during this period of time. Alternative solutions such as virtual reality technology, gamification, and technology-enhanced learning were especially salient and have the potential to mitigate challenges brought about by the pandemic. The use of technology in the clinical setting, in assessment, and to facilitate feedback, are important tools for improving learners' clinical skills performance. Collectively, these digital technologies can maximise learning and support mastery of knowledge, skills and attitudes.
Conclusion
The pandemic has cast a new light on existing methodologies and pedagogies in education. This review suggests that digital technology is shaping teaching and learning within radiography education and also that educators cannot ignore this digital shift. With the digital trajectory, it would be highly useful to transform approaches to education within radiography to support learning as radiography education moves towards the new normal era.
Implications for practice
Digital technology in education can help improve the learning experience for learners but educators need to be equipped with the technological skills and be adaptable to these changes. Continual sharing of experiences and knowledge among radiography educators is essential. Safety nets need to be in place to ensure digital inclusiveness and that no learner gets left behind due to the digital divide in education.}

Critical evaluations were incorporated into a road map to provide a comprehensive perspective of BIM and IoT data fusion. In addition, based on the findings, a two-level and interconnected data fusion framework was proposed, which illustrates the data process flow and differentiates the data abstraction level, data processing technologies and purpose of the fusion.

The last seventy years have been characterized by rapid advancements in computer technology, and the healthcare system has not been immune to this trend. However, anatomic pathology has remained largely an analog discipline. In recent years, this has been changing with the growing adoption of digital pathology, partly driven by the potential of computer-aided diagnosis. As part of an international collaboration, we conducted a comprehensive survey to gain a deeper understanding of the status of digital pathology implementation in Europe and Asia. A total of 127 anatomic pathology laboratories participated in the survey, including 75 from Europe and 52 from Asia, with 72 laboratories having established digital pathology workflow and 55 without digital pathology. Laboratories using digital pathology for diagnostic (n = 29) and non-diagnostic (n = 43) purposes were thoroughly questioned about their implementation strategies and institutional experiences, including details on equipment, storage, integration with laboratory information system, computer-aided diagnosis, and the costs of going digital. The impact of the digital pathology workflow was also evaluated, focusing on turnaround time, specimen traceability, quality control, and overall satisfaction. Laboratories without access to digital pathology were asked to provide insights into their perceptions of the technology, expectations, barriers to adoption, and potential facilitators. Our findings indicate that while digital pathology is still the future for many, it is already the present for some. This decade may be a time when anatomic pathology finally embraces the digital revolution on a large scale.}

The Design cycle develops the ontology, which includes: (i) goals, supplier processes, and resources as hierarchies of classes; (ii) properties to interconnect these classes; and (iii) SWRL rules to derive a possible combination of process steps to reach the goal of collaborative assembly. The feedback from SME Cluster managers indicates that OADM is a promising approach to overcoming barriers to planning demand-driven SME collaborations.

IC (Intelligent compaction) is an emerging and developing technology that can overcome the limitations of current quality control and quality assurance approaches, such as detection hysteresis and incompleteness. However, IC is mainly used in a vehicle system to realize real-time quality inspection, while its further potential is not fully exerted in advanced construction control and management as a comprehensive, continuous and nondestructive testing tool. This paper proposes a BIM (Building Information Model)-IoT (Internet of things) and IC integrated framework to provide a fundamental platform for advanced compaction quality monitoring and management. Specifically, BIM provides high-fidelity virtual assets of road infrastructure for data integration, visualization and construction organization management. IC is used to provide comprehensive compaction quality monitoring data and quality control methods. IoT (Internet of things) is adopted to connect physical and cyber assets by capturing real-time data from the actual operations in construction. Finally, a prototype system is developed as an implementation of the framework. The case demonstration of the system shows that the proposed framework can effectively integrate BIM and IC to realize the monitoring of road compaction quality and data in combination with IoT data, and the construction schedule can be rearranged and optimized based on the monitoring results. This study can facilitate to realize road compaction quality real-time monitoring and management, as well to offer a basic BIM-IoT platform that can be utilized as a prototype of road infrastructure digital twin to achieve more intelligent and sustainable management of the entire construction process in the future.}

The analysis employs the System Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) for 36 OECD countries over the period of 2000–2018. The empirical findings indicate that digitalization, green innovation, renewable energy, and financial development substantially promote environmental sustainability. Moreover, the interaction between digitalization, green innovation, renewable energy utilization, and financial development enhances the ecological footprint-mitigating effect of digitalization. In view of these results, merging digitalization and environmental policies may yield more robust outcomes and improved environmental quality compared to implementing a single policy in isolation.}

Based on experience with a specific example – sustainable mobility in Germany – it is argued that agent-based models are particularly suitable for Decision Theatres and that the method is useful not only for decision support but also for science communication and co-creation of a deeper knowledge of the system under discussion.

Previous research conducted on structured workplaces using traditional industrialist paradigms had established an ideal composition of employee traits. However, today's contrasting fast-paced environments may have made those profiles obsolete, prompting the need to identify a profile of personalities and interests that enables organizations to assemble a workforce high in digital self-efficacy, which fundamentally drives organizations’ agility. We proposed and evaluated such a model by conducting two studies at international (Study 1, N = 309) and French (Study 2, N = 1,025) publicly traded organizations. The results indicate the personality dimensions openness to experience and emotional stability and investigative and realistic vocational interests are predispositions for the development of digital self-efficacy. Furthermore, we found corroborative evidence for digital self-efficacy to facilitate workforce agility.

Researchers report a lack of adoption and ineffective utilisation of digital technologies in smaller tourism businesses. The study focuses on two university-facilitated projects of digital marketing adoption and utilisation by 53 small and medium sized tourism businesses in the South of England. The framework for this study was driven by Modes of Knowledge Transference and Technology-In-Practice. The findings describe peer-to-peer knowledge acquisition and sharing that take place in university-led projects and suggests that a combination of Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge helps entrepreneurs to advance their digital marketing knowledge. Peer-to-peer clusters are an effective means of placing digital marketing knowledge and technology in the context of small and medium tourism business practice. The paper provides implications for destination marketing organisations and policymakers and suggestions for future avenues of research are offered.}

To enhance the efficiency and security of data transmission in cloud computing, this study proposes a quantum cloud office model and presents a novel quantum dialogue protocol particularly designed for this model. The proposed protocol enables authenticated communication among office correspondents. Leveraging the unique properties of multiple quantum degrees of freedom, this protocol expands the channel capacity and enhances transmission efficiency. Compared to previous measurement-device-independent quantum dialogue (MDI-QD) protocols, this protocol not only further improves transmission efficiency but also enables mutual authentication between correspondents, effectively defending against the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. The utilization of a cross-Kerr medium for Bell measurements offers a 50% increase in efficiency compared to linear optical equipment. This novel protocol is tailored to the data transmission process within the cloud office model, thereby enhancing the communication efficiency and reinforcing secure data transmission.}

Traditionally, the Geographic Information System (GIS) is the tool for storing, manipulating and analysing spatial and geographic data. However, recent developments in new methods and technologies are reshaping the methodologies and processes of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. Encouraged by the current regulatory system, an improvement in approach, leading from the traditional planning to a shared and highly integrated digital model, is now made possible by using the Building Information Modelling (BIM). The collaborative project environment, typical of BIM tools, could become an important key success factor, especially in a framework of interoperability with other systems, such as GIS. Focusing on the airfield, this study aims to evaluate the potentiality and benefits given by the implementation of airport facilities in the BIM system and their interaction with the surrounding area. The results reveal that GIS and BIM interoperability enables to achieve a broader and deeper understanding of the digital models in the larger territorial context, facilitating for instance the analysis of possible interferences with aircraft operations in the interaction between facilities and surroundings. Furthermore, having the airport facilities implemented in BIM system, an overall optimisation of the management, maintenance, control and monitoring processes, as well as a better quality and saving on time and costs, could be observed. For this purpose, the application of a case study in this research work confirms the validity related to the practical features of the proposed framework. In fact, investigating the main requirements and characteristics to be taken into account during the BIM-GIS interoperability processes, the present approach may constitute a support tool for better planning and management of airport facilities.}

With increasing dissemination, AM confronts logistics service providers (LSPs) with the question of how they should adapt their business model to the threats and opportunities that come with the emerging digital technologies. We structure the AM activities of LSPs and develop a deep understanding of their resulting business model dynamics. For this exploratory purpose, this study develops a taxonomy and performs a cluster analysis to present six clusters of how LSPs approach AM today. The six profiles include LSPs that reactively monitor AM or, in contrast, proactively leverage AM for their internal operations and the development of new services for their external customers. Among them, four profiles entail fundamental changes to the traditional business models of LSPs. We find that these LSPs oftentimes continue to rely on their traditional “analog” service strengths to offer integrated service bundles of AM and logistics solutions. They bridge their lack of specific resources by strategic alliances with AM experts. Only a few LSPs have started severing ties to their traditional businesses to develop digitally dominated, platform-based AM services that require different resources. Overall, the comprehensive picture of AM activities enables us to contribute to the knowledge of how LSPs navigate in the digital age and to the nexus of business model dynamics and emerging technologies. We propose a set of propositions and support practitioners in analyzing and designing AM activities.}

A set of advanced technologies for digitalisation and a theory-based set of seven value drivers for PSM are identified for the proposed grid to facilitate the design of applications and interventions for digitalising PSM. The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.}

One of the main safety pillars is offering passengers a reliable emergency evacuation plan. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has disseminated guidelines for passenger ships to enhance the evacuation process understanding. Although the number of passenger ships is rising worldwide, implementing IMO's guidelines, particularly advance evacuation analysis, is still a young research area. Hence, this paper attempts to study previous research on human evacuation from the IMO perspective to uncover the current position of the issued guidelines in the literature. Accordingly, this research reviews 115 research publications published in scientific journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and doctoral and master dissertations from January 1999 to August 2022. As a result, the authors present the literature review of state-of-the-art papers to establish a firm foundation of past research. After identifying gaps, breakthrough points are clarified for future research about the benefits of handling uncertainty in input parameters, understanding human evacuation behavior, mutual interrelation among evacuation factors, and potential adoption of digital technologies in human evacuation from passenger ships.}

abstract = {The rapid evolution of information technology is the driving force behind the ongoing digital transformation. Ubiquitous communication devices and digital services have become an essential part in most of our lives. Context-awareness enables convenient new forms of interaction and instant delivery of relevant information for a given situation. IT services that provide a benefit to the user based on their current position or the position of another entity, are known as location-based services (LBS). In the context of the ongoing digitization of the manufacturing industry, LBS have the potential to improve processes on the shop floor and in the office environment. Unlike in the B2C sector, however, LBS have not yet found a solid foothold in industrial environments due to a number of barriers hindering the implementation. The main barrier is the lack of a standard indoor positioning solution, which is required for an indoor localization. As a result, the implementation of indoor LBS requires a tailored system comprising an appropriate indoor positioning technology, computational infrastructure as well as compatible software solutions. During the specification phase, it is necessary to evaluate the initial situation and existing hardware and software infrastructure to develop the optimal solution for a given company. In this paper, we present a feature-based approach that uses a feature model to specify industrial LBS for different application categories like asset management, information provision, wayfinding, security and process analytics. For each application category, we have identified the possible LBS features that can be combined to create fitting LBS for the scenario at hand. The feature model facilitates the configuration of individual LBS, taking into account various prerequisites of a company. Furthermore, the feature model is linked to a technology morphology, which enables an accessible containment of the available technological solutions. We use the example use case “automatic tool configuration” to validate the specification approach using the feature model and the technology morphology.}

In addition, the outcome variable relates to active social media behaviors, a novel dependent variable in this stream of research. The model is tested using SEM. The results show that social influence, social facilitation experience, perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived enjoyment (PE) are all significantly linked to perceived usefulness (PU) of social media; however, FoMO is not. GOSIP, PU, and PE are positively related to attitude toward social media use, which is positively related to active social media behaviors. We discuss the results and provide limitations and avenues for future research.}

These pressures necessitate a diversification of their business model, yet it remains uncertain how operators plan to adapt and how the government can facilitate the evolution of their mobility services. This study explores these issues from the viewpoint of small and medium-sized taxi firm operators in Japan, specifically focusing on their attitudes towards potential barriers, their preparedness for, and preferences towards new business models. To that end, we conducted a Statd Preference survey on new business models with taxi companies in the Chugoku region, western Japan. The findings reveal that an operator's attitude towards regulatory strictness indirectly lowers the likelihood of choosing new business models, whereas operational difficulties increase this probability. Interestingly, taxi firms operating in medium-sized cities tended to collaborate with private or public sectors in their new business models compared to firms in other areas. This study offers insights into policy discourse and design, emphasizing the need for strategic, collaborative, and contextually-aware responses to the evolving challenges within Japan's taxi industry.}

abstract = {Objective
Our objective was to develop an evaluation framework for electronic health record (EHR)-integrated innovations to support evaluation activities at each of four information technology (IT) life cycle phases: planning, development, implementation, and operation.
Methods
The evaluation framework was developed based on a review of existing evaluation frameworks from health informatics and other domains (human factors engineering, software engineering, and social sciences); expert consensus; and real-world testing in multiple EHR-integrated innovation studies.
Results
The resulting Evaluation in Life Cycle of IT (ELICIT) framework covers four IT life cycle phases and three measure levels (society, user, and IT). The ELICIT framework recommends 12 evaluation steps: (1) business case assessment; (2) stakeholder requirements gathering; (3) technical requirements gathering; (4) technical acceptability assessment; (5) user acceptability assessment; (6) social acceptability assessment; (7) social implementation assessment; (8) initial user satisfaction assessment; (9) technical implementation assessment; (10) technical portability assessment; (11) long-term user satisfaction assessment; and (12) social outcomes assessment.
Discussion
Effective evaluation requires a shared understanding and collaboration across disciplines throughout the entire IT life cycle. In contrast with previous evaluation frameworks, the ELICIT framework focuses on all phases of the IT life cycle across the society, user, and IT levels. Institutions seeking to establish evaluation programs for EHR-integrated innovations could use our framework to create such shared understanding and justify the need to invest in evaluation.
Conclusion
As health care undergoes a digital transformation, it will be critical for EHR-integrated innovations to be systematically evaluated. The ELICIT framework can facilitate these evaluations.}

abstract = {Within the scheduling framework, the potential of digital twin (DT) technology, based on virtualisation and intelligent algorithms to simulate and optimise manufacturing, enables an interaction with processes and modifies their course of action in time synchrony in the event of disruptive events. This is a valuable capability for automating scheduling and confers it autonomy. Automatic and autonomous scheduling management can be encouraged by promoting the elimination of disruptions due to the appearance of defects, regardless of their origin. Hence the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model oriented towards zero-disturbance and zero-disruption objectives has barely been studied. Both strategies combine the optimisation of production processes by implementing DTs and promoting ZDM objectives to facilitate the modelling of automatic and autonomous scheduling systems. In this context, this particular vision of the scheduling process is called smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS). The aim of this paper is to review the existing scientific literature on the scheduling problem that considers the DT technology approach and the ZDM model to achieve self-management and reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention. Specifically, 68 research articles were identified and analysed. The main results of this paper are to: (i) find methodological trends to approach SMS models, where three trends were identified; i.e. using DT technology and the ZDM model, utilising other enabling digital technologies and incorporating inherent SMS capabilities into scheduling; (ii) present the main SMS alignment axes of each methodological trend; (iii) provide a map to classify the literature that comes the closest to the SMS concept; (iv) discuss the main findings and research gaps identified by this study. Finally, managerial implications and opportunities for further research are identified.}

The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.}

One of the general approaches to support the model-based roadmapping is to develop a roadmap's metamodel that would define it independently from the application context and link it to the existing roadmapping literature. In this paper, we attempt to create such a metamodel by generalizing and formalizing existing document-based roadmaps. We validate our metamodel via reproducing three very different roadmaps from the literature, not included in the set of roadmaps from which the metamodel was created, using the novel formal approach. The fact that these roadmaps were reproduced using the proposed metamodel indicates its applicability to many classes of real roadmaps. The results of this work seem beneficial for architects of the software tools for roadmapping and for the regular participants of roadmapping sessions.}

This study proposes and tests a conceptual model of Maritime Knowledge Clusters (MKC) and the relations between their components, making use of survey data from 203 shipping professionals located in Singapore. Three theoretical perspectives, namely, relational view, knowledge-based view and resource-based view, have been employed. The results demonstrate that MKCs are substantiated by three critical components, in which the local knowledge cluster can develop global systemic mechanisms, thus further strengthening global linkages. Policy makers must endeavor to create a conducive local cluster environment with maritime firms being located in geographical proximity, and having local networks, knowledge base, and knowledge flows. They form the fundamental foundation for the growth of MKCs. Besides, maritime firms shall optimize the MKC’s local knowledge cluster to facilitate their global expansion, which will in turn boost the internationalization of the MKC.}

Digital technology was shown to be effective in facilitating teaching; thus while the pandemic and its variants negatively impacted the delivery of ophthalmology education with strict restrictions placed on face-to-face interactions and onsite education, it also provided a force to drive digital transformation for teaching. This chapter highlights two digital teaching programs developed by our group and implemented to act as a countermeasure to the restrictions placed in response to the pandemic. The first digital teaching program was designed for pregraduate and undergraduate students to enhance interest and to increase academic exposure to basic clinical, research, and educational domains in ophthalmology. The second program we developed was a virtual ophthalmology rotation to allow medical students to continue their ophthalmic education remotely in both completely virtual and hybrid learning environments; to conduct and present research projects from home; and to network with faculty and prepare for residency applications via Internet platforms. These innovations will be incorporated in the future beyond the pandemic because they have proven that face-to-face learning is not required for all aspects of the ophthalmology medical student teaching. Optimizing teaching available through evidence-based digital education will lead to graduates who are highly trained in eye examination skills, resulting in improved patient eye care through timely diagnosis, referrals, and treatment.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) characterizes a new generation of technologies capable of interacting with the environment and aiming to simulate human intelligence. The success of integrating AI into organizations critically depends on workers' trust in AI technology. Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, as incorrect levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. The European Commission's High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) have adopted the position that we should establish a relationship of trust with AI and should cultivate trustworthy AI. This article investigates the links between trust in AI, concerns related to AI use, and the ethics related to such use. We used data collected in 2019 from more than 30,000 individuals across the EU28. The data focuses on living conditions, trust, and AI uses and concerns. An econometric model is used. The endogenous variable is an ordered measure of trust in AI. We use an ordered logit model to highlight the factors associated with an increased level of trust in AI in Europe. The results show that many concerns related to AI use are linked to AI trust, and the ability to try out AI applications will also have an impact on initial trust. To enhance trust, practitioners can try to maximize the technological features in AI systems. The representation of the AI as a humanoid or a loyal pet (e.g., a dog) will facilitate initial trust formation. Moreover, findings reveal an unequal degree of trust in AI across countries.}

The aim of this study is to understand the implementation of open innovation processes by SMEs while highlighting two critical processes: open innovation implementation (OII) and open ambidextrous innovation practices (OAIP). The study employes a second-order factor analysis incorporating multigroup structural invariance analysis to explore the differences in ambidextrous innovation practices across SME size categories using a sample of 615 SMEs in Thailand. The primary finding reveals and confirms a statistically significant positive relationship between the implementation of open innovation and the advancement of ambidextrous innovation practices. This relationship underlines the importance of embracing open innovation, as it fosters ambidextrous innovation, thereby enabling fresh perspectives, accelerating creativity, and facilitating knowledge exchange. Three categories of MSMEs—microenterprises, small enterprises, and medium-sized enterprises—are shown to be well positioned for adopting open innovation strategies, each demonstrating a significant ability to foster open innovation practices. In the study, practical and policy recommendations for business practitioners and policy-makers are presented, emphasizing the importance of understanding the organizational, managerial, technological, and contextual factors that underpin successful open innovation implementation. A novel structural second-order factor model that deepens our understanding of the complex relationships between open innovation processes is also introduced, offering valuable insights for academic researchers. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of SMEs embracing open innovation practices and promoting ambidextrous innovation for sustained success and growth, and key strategic takeaways are proposed based on the empirical item-scale results.}

The ongoing shift to digitalization and Industry 4.0 provides novel opportunities and benefits to industrial firms in this regard, and researchers termed the adoption of digital technologies to servitization as “digital servitization”. In order to successfully transition towards digital servitization, fundamental reconfiguration of resources, organizational structures, work practices, infrastructure, culture, etc. are required. Hence, this paper performs a systematic literature review on prior studies covering dynamic capabilities for servitization and digital servitization. The purpose is to identify and compare the dynamic capabilities needed to facilitate a transition from “traditional” servitization to digital servitization. In doing so, this paper presents an integrated framework of dynamic capabilities to enable digital servitization, providing 22 micro-foundations for servitization and digital servitization, as well as the key challenges and enablers related to the transition from one to the other.}

In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997–2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.}

A partial least squares structural equation model and the fs-QCA technique were used to analyze the data collected. The results showed how two factors studied, Attitude and Facilitating Conditions directly affected the decision to use e-gov services. Attitude means that governments must find effective ways to entice positive attitudes toward using e-services, and Facilitating Conditions implies that the resources and facilities provided to users improve their intention to use. However, the second most robust relationship was associated with the influence of Performance Expectancy on Attitude, suggesting that the trust placed in e-gov by the citizens, based on previous experiences, is a crucial determinant of their attitude toward it and their behavior when using it.}

Based on the data from 278 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2019, multi-dimensional empirical tests were conducted to investigate the relationship between digital economy (DE) and spatial transfer of carbon emissions (CE). The results show that DE directly reduced CE. Mechanism analysis shows that DE reduced CE through local industrial transformation and upgrading (ITU). Spatial analysis shows that DE reduced local CE while aggravating neighboring CE. The spatial transfer of CE was attributed to the fact that when DE promoted the local ITU, it induced the transfer of the backward and polluting industries to neighboring regions, resulting in the spatial transfer of CE. Moreover, the spatial transfer effect of CE was maximum at 200 km. However, in recent years, rapid DE development has weakened the spatial transfer effect of CE. The results can provide insights into understanding the carbon refuge effect of industrial transfer in China in the context of DE and facilitate formulating appropriate industrial policies to promote inter-regional carbon reduction synergy. Thus, this study can provide a theoretical reference for achieving the dual-carbon target of China and the green economic recovery of other developing countries.}

However, many researchers ground the potential usability of the data on its quality. Organizations would benefit from receiving recommendations on the usability of the data before its use. We propose that the recommendation on the usability of the data be supported by a decision process, which includes a context-dependent data-quality assessment based on business rules. Ideally, this recommendation would be generated automatically. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) enables the assessment of data quality based on the evaluation of business rules, and also, provides stakeholders (e.g., data stewards) with sound support for the automation of the whole process of generation of a recommendation regarding usability based on data quality. The main contribution of the proposal involves designing and enabling both DMN-driven mechanisms and a guiding methodology (DMN4DQ) to support the automatic generation of a decision-based recommendation on the potential usability of a data record in terms of its level of data quality. Furthermore, the validation of the proposal is performed through the application of a real dataset.}

Best practices from spaces such as distance learning and virtual / remote laboratories can be leveraged to facilitate educators’ responses. This review is aimed at identifying evidence-based approaches for transforming hands-on labs into virtual or remote operation to achieve desired learning outcomes without compromising on soft skills and student self-efficacy. A critical review of the recent literature on delivering STEMM education laboratories in either a virtual or remote setting or a combination of both is presented here. Commonly emerging approaches are identified and strategies to implement remote or mixed-mode (a combination of remote and traditional lab components) delivery are highlighted. The value of these approaches to the educator is assessed based on claimed learning outcomes, availability of resources, technology, scheduling, and cost factors.}

The research undertakes an in-depth case study based approach. It uses data triangulation, where multiple sources of evidence (interviews, conference audio recordings and documents) are collected from the case organisation (a vendor) and its service ecosystem partners in the ICT sector. The partners included in the study are distributors, channel partners, competitors, and customers. B2B alliances are driven by the motivations to maximise strategic value and minimise transaction cost. Thus, using the ecosystem lens, we find that actors’ capabilities (resources and perceived value), vendor's approach to achieving strategic benefit and the channel governance mechanism enable value co-creation. However, using the transaction cost theory lens, we report that actors’ opportunistic behaviour, technological disruptions and new business model challenges lead to value co-destruction (in the form of termination of relationship, conflict and business liquidation). Alliance partners need to evaluate the strategic benefits of collaboration, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, market expansion and technology sharing, considering partners’ self-serving behaviour driven by transaction cost economies. All ecosystem actors are seeking to develop capabilities, exhibit knowledge differentiators, demonstrate technology leadership, reduce uncertainty and respond to new business model challenges thus causing value co-destruction. Thus, this research is more encompassing because it explores factors that lead to both value co-creation and co-destruction.}

Structural equation models test hypotheses on how privacy concern and privacy knowledge related to technology, HIPAA, and data breaches affect trust and intention to use HIT and the role that perceived justice has in mediating these relationships. The findings show that perceived justice fully mediates the negative effect of privacy concern and partially mediates the positive effects of knowledge of technology and knowledge of HIPAA on trust and intention to use HIT.

Prior research identified several carbon abatement instruments for the industry. However, the dynamic influence of different mechanisms on CO2 emissions in the industry remains unclear, and few studies have researched CO2 emission reductions in two nonferrous metal related industrial subsectors: nonferrous metal ore mining and nonferrous metal smelting. This research evaluated the dynamic effect of abatement instruments on the CO2 emissions in these two subsectors. The research discovered the factors that are highly linked with CO2 emissions by using an enhanced Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology model. The dynamic influence of these factors on CO2 emissions in the two subsectors was investigated using a vector autoregressive model. Findings show that in the two subsectors, labour productivity and industrial value-added are the most important factors explaining CO2 changes. The two variables have a negative long-term effect on CO2 emissions in the nonferrous metal ores mining, and increase CO2 emissions in the smelting of nonferrous metals. Improving energy efficiency in the nonferrous metal smelting industry decreases the CO2 emissions only in the short term. In all sectors, lowering the electrical carbon emission factors and changing the energy structure using different techniques are expected to help reduce long-term CO2 emissions. These results are critical for the Chinese government in creating long- and short-term energy plans for the nonferrous metal sector.}

However, organisations and processes are highly dependent on the political, economical and legal structures in which they operate. This may explain why most proposed solutions had difficulties in addressing the crisis up to now, as they could hardly be applied transversally to all forensic science models. Moreover, new tools and technologies are continuously developed by a quasi-infinite number of different scientific disciplines, thus leading to further diversity and fragmentation of forensic science. In this paper, it is proposed to shift the focus from means to purpose and consider forensic science current challenges in terms of discipline, before addressing organisations’ specific issues. As a distinct discipline, forensic science can refocus research and development on shared principles and purposes, such as reconstructing, monitoring, and preventing crime and security issues. This focus change will facilitate a better understanding of the trace as the object of study of forensic science and eventually lead to a more impactful and long-lasting effect. This approach will also foster the development of a forensic science culture (instead of a primarily technological culture) unified by purpose rather than means through more relevant education and research.}

We use the fuzzy-set approach by conducting qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability that exist among the 167 manufacturing and service firms in China that undergoes different levels of BMI. Results reveal that DI attributes work in three pathways to promote BMI, including organization-oriented with emphasis on improvisation, product-oriented by focusing on user experience and value proposition, and product-organization complemented. When to additionally include IT infrastructure capability for deeper analysis, results demonstrate three more representative configurations among DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability to facilitate BMI: IT-enabled organization-product orchestration, IT-enabled product-organization orchestration, and IT-dominated orchestration. This research contributes to DI literature by uncovering the configurations among DI attributes in promoting BMI, and clarifying the complicated interacting effects between DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability to facilitate BMI.}

The strengths and weaknesses of coal mining in Poland were also identified, along with its opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis). Innovative and sustainable development based on the Triple Helix Model (THM), as well as the Open innovation (OI) concept and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles were identified as opportunities for its sustainable development. The combination of these solutions should enable sustainable development of the industry, preserving its economic and social importance and reducing its negative impact on the environment. The use of new clean technologies in the operation and combustion of coal should reduce emissions of harmful substances into the environment. Intensive and government-supported cooperation between the scientific and research community and industry should significantly facilitate these processes. Another aspect important for the changes to be introduced is the social factor, for which the current situation represents an opportunity to preserve jobs in the mining industry, but also a challenge for its sustainable development. These seemingly mutually exclusive elements should form the basis of a new opening for Polish and European mining as an innovative industry based on knowledge and preserving the basic principles of ESG. The paper also outlines the most significant challenges facing the Polish mining industry on its way to innovative development. The article provides a new and relevant to the current reality perspective on the Polish mining industry in the context of the entire EU, for which the current geopolitical situation forces the necessity of setting a new direction of development. The geopolitical changes that have recently taken place in the global economy such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic and the armed conflict within Ukraine have caused very great turbulence in the energy market. Enthusiasm and uncritical adoption of green concepts in the EU has caused, along with the reduction of gas and coal imports from Russia, turbulence in the energy market. This situation has created a great opportunity for the development of the mining industry in Poland, which has not yet managed, following the example of other EU countries, to extinguish the industry. In order to take advantage of this opportunity and obtain a permanent place in the energy mix in the EU, it is necessary to rapidly develop the mining industry in a sustainable manner based on innovative solutions.}

Disruptive connected health technologies, or digitalization, are suggested to tackle the healthcare challenges and transform traditional care models. In Finland, the transformation is manifested by the development of various digital hospitals and citizen-centric care models that foster self-care by utilizing connected health technologies. In this paper we introduce qualitative research that uses social practice theory in order to understand how connected health technologies shape a pediatric day surgery practice in future digital hospitals. Major improvement needs were identified to center on discursive actions (i.e., communication that occurs between health professionals and patients), since hospital IT systems, data exchange, and internal and external communication were found to not support pediatric surgery practice as expected. To improve the current situation, we found out that there is a need to change the patient role to be more active, creating data that health professionals could use through their own patient record systems. Connected health solutions allow this type of interaction between things (i.e., communication through mobile apps, medical devices, etc.) and agents (i.e., health professionals). There is an urgent need to improve communication channels such as Chat, WhatsApp, and mobile applications that gather all necessary information and instructions from patients before and after the surgery. However, these solutions cannot be co-created separately from the clinical decision systems that allow discursive actions among healthcare professionals. These solutions, e.g. mobile applications designed to support patients going through the surgery practice, will also significantly impact and change pediatric surgery practice at hospitals.}

Modern chemistry is the backbone of our society, but it is also a major contributor to global environmental pollution and the ongoing climate crisis. The transition toward a sustainable future requires a radical transformation of how chemistry is designed, developed, and used. This represents a “break it or make it” challenge for the chemical industry with significant technology lock-in and high entry barriers to radical innovations. We propose that urgently required systemic changes in chemical industry, research and development (R&D), chemicals assessment and management, and education to advance sustainable chemistry are attainable through increased and more rapid adoption of digitalization and new digital tools. This will enable flexible data exchange, increased transparency of information flows along cross-country chemical, material, and product life cycles, and chemistries that are safe and sustainable by design, addressing the complexity of chemicals-environment-health interactions and lowering the costs of entry into chemical R&D and manufacture, and new, more sustainable and collaborative business models.}

A knowledge of the factors that affect student learning could help universities and study centres adjust their curricula and teaching methods to the needs of their students. One of the first measures employed by teaching institutions was to create Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). This type of environment makes it possible to attract a larger number of students because it enables them to study from wherever they are in the world, meaning that the student’s location is no longer a constraint. Moreover, VLEs facilitate access to teaching resources, they make it easier to monitor the activity of the teaching staff and of the interactions between students and teachers. Thus, online environments make it possible to assess the factors that cause the students’ academic performance to increase or decrease. To understand the factors that influence the university learning process, this paper applies a series of automatic learning techniques to a public dataset, including tree-based models and different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Having applied these techniques to the dataset, the number of times students have accessed the resources made available on VLE platforms has been identified as a key factor affecting student performance. This factor has been analysed by conducting a real case study which has involved 120 students doing a masters degree over a VLE platform. Concretely, the case study participants were masters degree students in areas related to computer engineering at the University of Salamanca.}

Platforms and ecosystems can play vital roles in the proliferation of technologies, which can facilitate a digital transformation of society aimed at equitable and efficient service delivery to citizens. Despite being innovative, citizen-centric, and citizen-inclusive, such platforms has been observed to be rare in emerging economies. Our study assesses the factors that lead to the intention to continue to use these platforms, with the objective of establishing a revised approach to better governance through these platform-based services. A conceptual framework is proposed, based on an integration of various models, and tested using primary data from citizens subscribing to platform-based government services. The results indicate that a continuous availability of such services has better predictive power for the continual-use intention. A unique contribution of the study worth highlighting is the significance of the factor, “sovereign structural assurance,” a pre-requisite for strengthening the degree of control. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that platforms should invest in controls for structural assurance. These interventions can serve as contrivances that create a sustainable model for such services. A successful convergence of the factors would accelerate the government services by transforming the public service landscape.}

For the manufacturing corporations that provide maintenance services, the efficiency of industrial maintenance plays a crucial role in the competitiveness and is tightly related to the technical documentation supporting maintenance. However, the process of documentation creation faces several challenges due to lack of access to the physical equipment and difficulties in remote communication between globally distributed departments. To address these shortcomings, this research investigates the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate asynchronous collaboration of globally dispersed departments involved in the pipeline of maintenance method and documentation creation. The presented proof-of-concept (the COVE-VR platform) has been developed as an academia-industry collaboration and evaluated iteratively with subject matter experts. The proposed VR platform consists of two virtual environments and eight virtual tools, which allow interaction with virtual prototypes (3D CAD models) and means of digital content creation. Our findings show the high relevance of the developed solution for the needs of industrial departments and the ability to support asynchronous collaboration among them. This article delivers qualitative findings on the value of VR technology and presents guidelines on how to develop virtual tools for digital content creation within VR, adaptable to other industrial contexts. We suggest providing embedded guidance and design consistency to ensure smooth interactions with virtual tools and further discuss the importance of proper positioning, the transparency of operations and the information property of generated content.}

These technologies facilitate working personnel and make it more appealing to complete their duties efficiently and accurately. The main aim of this paper is to understand the concept of Management 4.0, its technologies and applications for proper management systems. As Management 4.0 enhances process control, the chance of human error is reduced, leading to increased efficiency. It enables rapid and intelligent decision-making, reduces costs, accelerates growth, and raises profitability. Management 4.0 technologies and advanced data analytics are helpful to make smart supply chain management well suited to fulfil industry 4.0. Thus, to overcome various obstacles and effectively deploy Management 4.0 technologies in manufacturing industries, top management must establish a clear asset performance management plan with the help of process engineers familiar with industrial system failure occurrences and what operators need to improve. Management 4.0 involves advanced technologies, system connectivity, data collection & analysis at the organisation level. Management 4.0 is expected to be a critical component in the long-term survival of any business, either manufacturing or service-providing organisations. This paper explores the development of Management 4.0 and its dimensions and transformations through Management 4.0 perspectives. Finally, the significant role of Management 4.0 for appropriate private management system in manufacturing industries are identified. Organisations require a system that seamlessly meets the company's expectations, consumers, investors, and other stakeholders to remain competitive, and Management 4.0 will enable this.

So far, traditional nostrification processes face challenges related to high process cycle times, elevated fees, and fraud incidents. In the higher education domain, blockchain-based approaches have emerged to revitalize the verification of academic qualifications, but they mostly rely on closed concepts offering their facility to a limited circle of entities. As a result, the verification of degrees is not publicly available to any third party. Moreover, in most cases, a concise process-aware approach describing the intended functionality with appropriate models is missing; this absence raises ambiguity and trust issues in the implemented application. This paper presents the design and early implementation of the VerDe (Verified Degrees) platform; a proposed blockchain-based application for registration and verification of academic qualifications. The novelty of the approach presented in this paper is the implementation of VerDe as a decentralized application utilizing Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN). This work demonstrates that usage of BPMN constructs provides an efficient method in addressing blockchain usability and complexity issues and facilitates the design and implementation of blockchain-based applications. The benefits of deploying VerDe in conjunction with BPMN are an efficient and transparent facility able to handle mobility consequences, detect fraud, and overcome administrative barriers by offering the verification capability to any third-party, and employing a custom-made token that emulates the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).}

Accordingly, electronic procurement systems (EPSs) have benefits that improve the economic, environmental and social initiatives for sustainable construction. However, the slow rate of EPSs uptake evinces the need for strategic approaches towards their widespread implementation. Scoping the previous studies on EPSs, there is a lack of research on the influence dynamics of these strategies for effective promotion of EPSs in the built environment. Therefore, this study investigates the dynamic influences of strategies by using the neurofuzzy model for the effective promotion of EPSs implementation. Through a comprehensive literature review, 14 strategies were employed in an expert survey. A total of 121 datasets were collected and analyzed in the study. From the data analysis, five groups were derived: technology education, innovation culture management, technological stimulation environment, incentives and partnership mechanism and organizational integration support. Further, the neurofuzzy model and sensitivity analysis were used to predict and determine optimal strategies for promoting EPSs implementation. The findings showed dynamic ways of hybridizing the strategies for EPSs promotion. Two hybrid-approaches, in addition to other strategies, that actively enhance effective EPS implementation are ‘innovation culture management – technology education’ and ‘innovation culture management – incentives and partnership mechanism’. Additionally, the combinations of strategies that result in low promotion of EPSs were also highlighted. This study provides a deepened understanding of the dynamic influences of strategies for researchers and practitioners to effectively promote the widespread implementation of EPSs in the built environment.}

Building on the market-driven view and the dynamic capabilities view of competitive strategy, we examine SM use in a framework of market-sensing and customer-linking capabilities that influence firm performance. Our research model posits that market orientation stimulates SM use to enhance market-sensing capability thereby facilitating two customer-linking capabilities, namely customer relationship management and brand management, which collectively contribute to greater marketing performance and financial performance. Our research model is empirically tested using a survey of 143 UK B2B SMEs. The findings broadly support our theorization in which the strategic use of SM, an essential part of market-sensing capability, enhances customer-linking capabilities. Interestingly, although SM use influences brand management capability, its suggested influences on both customer relationship management capability and marketing performance occur only through the mediation of brand management capability. Both customer-linking capabilities positively influence marketing performance and in turn financial performance. Our findings provide novel conceptual and empirical advancement of how market-centric B2B SMEs strategically use SM to enhance their market-sensing and in turn customer-linking capabilities, and hence firm performance.}

abstract = {Development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key approach to achieving economic growth in the Middle East and successful adoption of technology is vital for SMEs' success and continuity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is part of a new generation of technologies that can facilitate competitive advantage but currently there is a lack of evidence regarding AI applications in relation to B2B SMEs in Middle East countries. Therefore, this study empirically examines antecedents to, and consequences of, successful acceptance of AI practices by B2B SMEs in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model based on the technology-organisation-environment framework is developed which considers the impact of AI enablers and AI readiness on the acceptance of AI practices, and the impact of this on relational governance, performance, and SMEs' AI-based business customer interaction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling of survey data collected from B2B SMEs (n = 392). The results showed that, of the AI enablers, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by both technology roadmapping and attitude but not professional expertise. Of the AI readiness variables, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by infrastructure and awareness but not technicality. The acceptance of AI practices was found to significantly affect AI-enabled relational governance and performance, and SME's business customer AI-based interaction. This study provides a broader base for theoretical and practical understanding of issues related to AI practices in SMEs and the B2B sector in general.}

One of the core value propositions is a dedicated Digital Innovation environment comprising several toolkits and workspaces, designed to support Product-Service Systems (PSS) prototyping – a key ingredient for PSS lifecycle management. At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin – a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation. For design-oriented, artifact building research, a higher Technology Readiness Level can thus be achieved (compared to the level that idea development methods typically attain).}

Organizational resilience models are either conceptual and/or mainly derived from studies on large organizations focusing on their strategic and operational capabilities, with the resource and capabilities constraints faced by SMEs largely ignored. This study applies the Herringbone model of organizational resilience to evaluate the internal and external factors that enable SMEs to (re)build resilience during COVID-19. In-depth interviews with owner-managers of tourism organizations in Christchurch, New Zealand reveal several themes and sub-themes that reflect not only a close influence of the owner/manager PsyCap on organizational resilience, but also the role of internal (ISC) and external (ESC) social capital in facilitating and hindering organizational resilience. As such, the study highlights the interplay between psychological and social resources in facilitating organizational recovery during COVID-19 using resilience capacities and activities.

This paper presents examples on how the digitalisation of chemical processes as graphs can facilitate their study and analysis for developing alternative process designs. In a process graph, inputs, outputs and unit operations are represented as nodes and streams are edges which can be weighted using process variables such as flow rate. Once a process is represented as a graph, community detection algorithms can be applied to identify process modules and obtain their modularity. The novel approach presented is based on modular decompositions to identify highly related unit operations in a flowsheet which can be analysed for insightful directions to improve a chemical process. The approach showed to be helpful in analysing a biofuel production process by adopting a combined economic and greenhouse gas emissions analysis at a modular level for hot spot analysis and identification of opportunities for decarbonisation. In an application to process integration, CO2 capture and utilisation networks are analysed in terms of its modularity and efficiency in processing CO2. In both cases, the improved designs had higher modularity values suggesting a correlation between modularity and technical performance which needs to be investigated further. Finally, prospective applications of modularity and modular decomposition approaches to realise several digitalisation tasks are presented.}

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.}

abstract = {Manufacturers, especially SMEs, are increasingly adopting digitalization to improve their agility to respond to the fluctuating market dynamics and to be transparent. To achieve sustained competitiveness, SMEs are shedding their reluctance to invest in technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics. Further, Manufacturing Execution System (MES) can serve as the intelligence hub, integrating product lifecycle with manufacturing, augmenting the IoT investments to orchestrate their facilities to be aligned to deliver what the customer needs. MES is a pivotal function integrating virtual and physical worlds and that makes it worthy of deeper examination. Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) is the evolved state of standalone MES, and it consolidates production processes to facilitate quality management, scheduling, manufacturing execution and more. The motivation of this research is to study the potential barriers of implementing MOM/MES that reduces its effectiveness and it has three goals. Firstly, the current knowledge associated with MOM/MES needs to be examined to derive its relevance, functions and benefits. Secondly, potential barriers of MOM/MES are to be identified that can reduce its effectiveness. Thirdly, approaches need to be established to overcome the barriers and improve the overall value of the initiative. SMEs cannot afford delayed returns on their digital investments; therefore, it is crucial to mitigate the barriers of implementing MOM/MES. This study resulted in calling attention to five barriers and its corresponding mitigations - constructive closed-loop, cross-functional integration, flexible operations orchestrations, high-availability cloud connection and insightful data contextualization. Most barriers discussed in the past studies can be classified as readiness related, i.e. funding, expertise, compatibility, priority, capacity, security, whereas the barriers discussed in this research paper are directly related to implementation. Knowing the barriers and its mitigation approaches, manufacturers can now pre-empt measures to neutralize the challenges and make MOM/MES adoptions successful.}

abstract = {This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs – those available – to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data – if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy – in the absence of BIM – are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures.}

DT is rapidly diffusing in numerous industries with the interdisciplinary advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research trends in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G-and-Beyond networks) and design tools, and current computational intelligence paradigms (e.g., edge and cloud computing-enabled data analytics, federated learning). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT’s adoption.}

Questionnaires have been distributed to collect employees’ preferences concerning the circular supply chain management criteria (profit, innovation, sustainability, and optimization). The responses have been organized into three clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique is adopted to evaluate these technologies since it constitutes a reliable managerial tool when vagueness impacts the smooth operation of the supply chain. Results indicate the ranking order of the investigated digital technologies (CPS>IoT>CM>BDA) as well as the circular benefits and the supply chain attributes imparted upon implementing these technologies. Such benefits and attributes are provided to assess the impact of these digital technologies on a circular economy. Lastly, the perspective of the selection process affected by other factors, such as the enterprise’s extroversion level and its internal structure, are discussed.}

Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways. The advent of new information technologies, such as Digital Twin, is promoting industrial digital transformation. Effective lifecycle management must now consider all phases of the project, especially Operations and Maintenance (O&M), where the use of the 3D model is no longer the digital model, but the digital duplicate of the Infrastructure.

abstract = {Applications of digital twin (DT) contribute to smart manufacturing via the integration of the cyber domain and the real world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is based on machine learning (ML) is generally recognized as being among the most promising technological developments in the manufacturing industry. Despite this, machine learning techniques call for enormous quantities of high-quality training datasets, and in the case of supervised ML, human labeling of such datasets is often necessary. Collecting and analyzing historical performance data to uncover operational insights has been a long-standing driver of efficiency and innovation for a wide variety of businesses, across all industrial sectors and even farther afield. However, the possible advantages of this method have not yet been leveraged to their maximum. There is a tendency for vast volumes of data, spanning anything from the current state of subsurface assets to the attitude that customers express on social media postings, to go mostly unrecorded and unanalyzed. This may be a problem for businesses. However, due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, supporting production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently quite costly. Cyber Twins (CTs) are an extension of DTs that we propose using to facilitate the rapid and low-cost creation of Industry 4.0 applications. CTs may incorporate machine simulators and provide semantic descriptions of the machines they model, which makes it possible to test applications without putting the production line at risk or incurring additional costs. The applications for Industry 4.0 are based on CT and the accompanying cost models are the primary topics of this research. Second, the paper provides empirical results that connect existing academic literature to the interdependencies between edge components and internal and external services and systems in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The novel aspect of this research is a new method for creating a DT, or a virtual representation that acts as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process as defined by a conceptual model. This is the chapter’s primary contribution. The approach that was used to conduct the research for this article was conceptually similar to an investigation of complex, linked, and coupled systems using the grounded theory. This research provides an outline of how to increase AI development in IoT networks via integrating human-computer interactions across different knowledge management systems. These interactions take place in different information management systems. In addition, the previously used real-time controllable method has been improved, as well as optimized. Additionally, it performs simulation testing on the method in both a serial and a parallel fashion. The relevant mining time of the improved algorithm is shown to be substantially less than the time required by the conventional data mining method when applied to the same dataset, as shown by the test results when the ideal scenario of the parallel algorithm has been achieved. The amount of time required for conventional mining is around three and a half times as long as the amount of time required for data mining in this study, and the amount of power that the optimization method requires to operate has been decreased to 20W. With the help of AI, the manufacturing model (DT) and the decision support system are able to include all of the information generated by these subsystems. DT data technology facilitates the identification of pertinent information that can be processed and used to inform managerial decision-making. Applications of AI may open a wide variety of doors in the manufacturing industry, leading to the creation of new business models and the improvement of existing procedures. A formal model was used to define the landscape to guarantee the feasibility of conducting an in-depth analysis of the status and progression of the landscape, while taking into account DT and other technologies. The adoption of DT and Industrial Internet of Things for modeling of a real enterprise’s production process was taken into consideration. However, Digital Twin Store (DTS) has stricter standards, particularly in regard to the real-time engagement that is expected. A new technique that satisfies the aforementioned characteristics may be found in the use of AI, which is an efficient way of boosting the intelligence of the physical shop floor. In this piece of research, a conceptual framework for AI-enhanced DTS in interaction is presented. The real-time engagement is significantly increased by AI-enhanced DTS, thanks to its predictive control. The AI-enhanced interaction implementation technique in DTS is also discussed in length in this presentation. Finally, the DTS has implemented the necessary technology to support interaction.}

This paper fills that gap by analyzing the impact of external factors on the implementation of circular economy and technology, and their influence on sustainable-oriented innovation and sustainable performance. Responses from 165 Mexican SMEs have been collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling to test direct and indirect effects between constructs. Findings reveal that while both governmental support and customer pressure facilitate the adoption of circular economy, only governmental support contributes directly to technology implementation. They also highlight the value of circular economy to support the adoption of sustainable-oriented innovation and to mediate the relationship between technology implementation and sustainable-oriented innovation. The overarching finding is that circular economy promoting sustainability-oriented innovation has a positive impact on financial, environmental, and social performance. This is a key implication to inform managers in SMEs on the potential benefits of investing in sustainable solutions.}

abstract = {The port industry is constantly evolving and this evolution brings about change in many different areas. Some of these areas are: operational and infrastructural capabilities, governance models and administrative frameworks, the introduction of new technologies or alliances and business strategies. Nowadays, one of the main drivers of changes in the ports sector is the digital transformation that smart ports are experiencing. The level of integration of different devices, agents and activities, together with an increasing connectivity between different ports has created a new ecosystem in which new risks have appeared. Cybersecurity is one of the challenges of the industry and policymakers should work alongside the private sector to ensure these critical infrastructures are adequately protected while facilitating the full development of new technologies in a sector that has relatively lagged behind others in transitioning to the new ‘4.0 world’.}

abstract = {The digital economy, driven by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), has emerged as a significant contributor to economies worldwide. However, accurately defining and measuring its impact on national economies remains a complex endeavor. This paper explores the definition, measurement, role, and impacts of the digital economy across various economies. It also examines the involvement of governments and telecommunication regulators in assessing the digital economy and identifies future directions for developing countries. A systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA Model is employed to investigate the factors and indices used to measure the digital economy. The findings highlight ongoing efforts to harmonize the definition and metrics; nonetheless, challenges persist due to the scarcity of appropriate datasets and variations in country-specific definitions. Additionally, the effectiveness of existing digital economy indices and toolkits in assessing the level of digitalization in developing countries is evaluated. The paper concludes that despite ongoing efforts to bridge the gaps, the concept of the digital economy remains defined and measured differently, necessitating a new definition that accounts for various contextual peculiarities. Furthermore, a roadmap is proposed to develop a toolkit that ensures comprehensive measurement, thus preventing an underestimation of the digital economy's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in developing countries. The paper underscores the need for international and multi-stakeholder dialogue to establish a common understanding of the digital economy's definition and measurement. Developing countries, such as Nigeria, are urged to develop or adopt new metrics tailored to their unique circumstances, facilitating an accurate and efficient quantification of the digital economy's impact on crucial indicators like GDP. Improved statistical data collection and recording methodologies are recommended for both governments and the private sector. Moreover, the paper advocates for the establishment of a Digital Economy Advisory Board (DEAB) in developing countries to maximize the benefits of the ongoing global transition to the digital economy.}

abstract = {Following the unprecedented outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), educators and students have shifted from conventional face-to-face lectures to fully virtual sessions that were delivered via video conferencing software. This research investigates the facilitating conditions and the students' perceptions toward using these interactive resources to continue their learning journey. The data was gathered through a structured questionnaire among 777 students in tertiary education. The survey instrument comprised valid measures that are frequently utilized in academia, to evaluate the individuals' acceptance of interactive educational technologies. A partial least squares (PLS) approach revealed that there were very significant factors that were predicting the students' dispositions to utilize synchronous learning programs. The findings underlined the importance of providing appropriate facilitating conditions to improve perceptions and attitudes toward interactive conferencing software. These results reflect the latest developments, as COVID-19 has inevitably accelerated the digital transformation in the realms of education. This contribution implies that students adapted well to a new normal. It confirmed that they are willing to participate and engage in virtual meetings through video conferencing programs.}

In today's turbulent landscape, organizational resilience has emerged as a key variable for responding to external challenges and facing uncertainty. In this context, our study aims to analyze the role of social media use as an antecedent of corporate entrepreneurship and firm performance in Spanish SMEs, while also examining the mediating role of organizational resilience in this process. Analyzing data from a sample of 259 firms, we tested our proposed hypotheses using structural equation modeling. The results confirm that use of social media tools positively impacts the entrepreneurial capabilities of the SMEs examined. The findings also stress the strategic relevance of organizational resilience, which exerts a perfect mediating impact on firm performance. These findings have significant implications for managers, as they show the path managers must take to benefit from social media use, become more entrepreneurial and resilient, and achieve business success in these turbulent times.}
