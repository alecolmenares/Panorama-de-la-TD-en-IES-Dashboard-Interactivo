abstract = {With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.}

A deconstruction evaluation model for deconstruction feasibility prediction indicates that the unique non-contact scanning technology can evaluate the deconstruction, improve the safety of deconstruction, and facilitate the transformation from destructive demolition to optimal deconstruction. One case study demonstrates that the accuracy of the structural information less than 1.94 mm can be controlled within the effective deviation range by combining the building information modelling (BIM) and the digital technology.

Promising applications include asset management as well as peer-to-peer networks for the transparent exchange of data and information. International climate finance stands to benefit in particular ways from these new opportunities in financial technology. Distributed ledger technologies could be leveraged to support climate action, for example by facilitating transparent and standardized transactions, or by enabling more efficient monitoring and accreditation processes. In view of these promising opportunities, we focus our inquiry on the case of the Green Climate Fund to explore how distributed ledger technologies can be used for innovative climate finance. Based on our analysis of different digital system models and potential use cases, we then discuss some of the technical and political challenges that may arise, for example with regard to standards and safeguards, governance processes, country ownership, and further capitalization. Our findings show that distributed ledger-based systems could benefit the work of the fund in key areas such as multi-stakeholder coordination and impact assessment. However, our analysis also points to the concrete limitations of technology driven solutions. Digital technologies are not a standalone solution to persistent resource allocation and governance challenges in international climate finance, especially because the design and deployment of these digital systems is inherently political.}

In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process.

In the domain of land administration, like others, the process is challenging: complex laws and regulations, lengthy process descriptions, shared organisational responsibilities, differing information encodings and formats, and seeking compliance with the LADM ISO 19152 standard, must be considered. Between 2016 and 2018, The Netherlands’ Cadastre, Land Registry and Mapping Agency – in short, Kadaster – successfully undertook the renewal of the information system supporting its deeds registration. The previous system dated back to the 1980s. In-house data modelling specialists led the program, the most extensive undertaken in decades. Inspired by action-research principles, the process and resultant lessons are documented using a case study approach. It is shown that beyond Model Driven Architectures, other model-driven methodologies, such as Domain-Driven Design, are entirely useful in the land administration domain. A domain is usually more extensive than a few objects, and to make it more manageable, DDD divides a domain into subdomains. The DDD term ‘problem domain’ is used to define a functional area within a context such as an organisation or department. The terms domain in DDD and LADM have common characteristics as considering contexts such as a land registry and a cadastre. Evans (2003) and Vernon (2013) articulate how DDD is a set of design practices, techniques and fundamental principles, terms, and implications to facilitate the development of software projects within complex domains, used to guide software developers and domain experts to share and represent models of knowledge from the domain. In DDD, the ubiquitous language is also essential in intersecting the jargons between domain experts and IT experts. The LADM provides a formal language for describing similarities and differences for describing the many aspects of the land administration domain. The approach demands greater participation from domain experts: they lead modelling of the current state and its evolution: the events. The Annex N of ISO 19152 describes that LADM covers both event-based and state-based modelling via LA_Source and VersionedObject. The application of Event-Based Modelling and Event Sourcing is still relatively novel to the LA domain. Event Sourcing ensures that all current state changes are stored as a sequence of events, enabling querying and state reconstruction. The new information system is considered futureproof, delivering improvements for deed registration times, monitoring, traceability/auditing, history management and interoperability. Further research suggestions include undertaken Domain-Driven Design in other contexts, particularly those implementing LADM.}

This research innovatively calculates ICT capital in China from 2001 to 2018 and explores how ICT capital affects carbon emission efficiency and its spatial spillover effects from a digital investment perspective. The empirical results prove that ICT capital contributes to improvement of carbon emission efficiency, pure technical efficiency, scale efficiency and technological progress. Furthermore, interestingly, ICT communication capital was found to have the strongest effect on improving carbon emission efficiency, while ICT hardware capital and software capital have a weaker effect. The spatial effect demonstrates that ICT capital not only helps improve the local carbon emission efficiency but also has spatial spillovers to the surrounding areas and has the most prominent effect on the carbon emission efficiency of the central region. The mediation tests illustrate that ICT capital improves carbon emission efficiency by promoting technological innovation, alleviating industrial structure distortions, enhancing resource allocation efficiency and accelerating human capital accumulation. These findings have important policy guiding significance for the region to stimulate the potential of ICT capital and facilitate the low-carbon transformation of the economy.}

abstract = {Summary
This article outlines the need for, and possible solutions to the problem of third parties’ legally untrammelled ability to collect and use identified or identifiable personal, sometimes very sensitive, health data. A solution would be implementation of a comprehensive legal framework – from international treaties through national legislation to operationalising data privacy and ethics by design at the level computer software (algorithmic) instructions. At least since the last decade of the twentieth century, digitisation of health data and creation of national electronic health records infrastructure has held the promise of enabling the attainment of such public health goals as personal health management, health care delivery, health-related research, and population health surveillance. Great advances in Big Data technology, and even more so, the algorithmic revolution, has facilitated these four goals, though not necessarily in the ways envisaged by scholars and policy-makers of the time. Thus, personal health management is supported by apps such as Apple Health; telemedicine and teleradiology systems enable health care delivery to patients wherever they are located. Health-related medical, commercial, socio-economic and socio-political research based on Big Data is booming, while national electronic health record systems allow national and international agencies to track and scrutinize health of individuals and populations. However, unregulated and rampant “datafication” of identified or identifiable personal health information about individuals collected, managed, and disseminated without their knowledge and informed consent effectively treats data subjects – us – as mere means to an end. The law has been lagging a long way behind technical and commercial development, yet it is possible to safeguard privacy and other fundamental rights of data subjects. For example, as part of the European Union's Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Parliament adopted Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the “protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data”, and the Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the “protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data”. The Regulation shall apply, and the Directive will enter into force (requiring EU Member States to transpose it into their national law) in May 2018. In the United Kingdom, the Investigative Powers Act (UK) 2016 has systemically incorporated approach to statutory controls in form of proportionality and necessity tests on powers that national security and law enforcement agencies must intercept, communications, access, collect and manage massive volumes of data (known as “bulk powers”). These controls aim to create privacy safeguards for intentionally or inadvertently targeted individuals. Thus, the law seems to be “awakening”. However, a comprehensive and systematic regulatory framework of controls and protections is yet to be postulated. This article outlines an approach consisting of vertical tiers that can be implemented separately or in total. The article has two parts. The first part provides background to the interface between developments in technology and unconsented to “datafication” of our personal health from which, unbeknown to us, third party algorithms create our digital identity. The second part outlines proposal that envisages a five-tier legal framework for protection of identifiable personal health data. Protections at each tier would be discrete yet capable of integration. At the base – the design level – it possible for software engineers and computer programmers to specify precisely defined algorithmic instructions for processing personal data in accordance with privacy laws and ethical standards. At the next level – data operators and/or analysts (whether human or an automated algorithmic program) – legal tests of proportionality and necessity and ethical conduct could be implemented by legislation and embedded in the algorithm design. At the third level – individuals and organizations storing and using the data – responsibility for its integrity and security as well as privacy and ethics could be governed by legislation. At the top level, international treaties could provide for uniform standards and approach.
Résumé
Cet article étudie le problème et propose des pistes de solutions au problème de tierces personnes ayant la capacité, légalement incontrôlable, d’accumuler et d’utiliser des données identifiées ou identifiables, parfois très confidentielles, sur la santé. Une des solutions qui s’offre serait la mise en place d’un cadre réglementaire exhaustif – des traités internationaux, en passant par la législation nationale, puis à la mise en place d’un système de données confidentielles et d’éthique à partir d’un logiciel d’instruction (algorithmique). Depuis au moins la dernière décennie du vingtième siècle, la digitalisation des données sur la santé et la création de dossiers de santé en ligne à l’échelle nationale permettent d’atteindre des objectifs de santé publique tels la gestion de la santé personnelle, la prestation de soins, la recherche en santé et la surveillance de la santé de la population. Les avancées dans la technologie des mégadonnées, et qui plus est, la révolution algorithmique, a facilité l’accomplissement de ces quatre objectifs, quoique d’une façon différente à celle envisagée par les chercheurs et les responsables politiques de l’époque. En effet, la gestion de la santé personnelle est encouragée par des applications comme Apple Health ; des systèmes de télémédecine et de téléradiologie permettent la livraison de soins aux patients n’importe où. Les recherches médicale, commerciale, socioéconomique et sociopolitique liées à la santé et basées sur les mégadonnées sont en plein essor, alors que des systèmes nationaux de dossiers de la santé électroniques permettent aux agences nationales et internationales de tracer et d’examiner la santé des individus et des populations. Cependant, la « datafication » non réglementée et rampante d’information personnelle sur la santé des individus qui est accumulée, gérée et diffusée sans qu’ils ne le sachent et sans leur consentement traite les sujets de ces données – nous – comme le simple moyen une finalité autre. Le droit a pris du retard face aux développements techniques et commerciaux, mais il demeure possible de protéger la confidentialité et autres droits fondamentaux des sujets de ces données. À titre d’exemple, dans le cadre de la stratégie pour un marché unique numérique de l’Union européenne, le Parlement européen a adopté le règlement (UE) 2016/679 relatif à la « protection des personnes physiques à l’égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel et à la libre circulation de ces données » et la directive (UE) 2016/680 relative à la « protection des personnes physiques à l’égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel par les autorités compétentes à des fins de prévention et de détection des infractions pénales, d’enquêtes et de poursuites en la matière ou d’exécution de sanctions pénales, et à la libre circulation de ces données ». Le règlement s’applique et la directive entrera en vigueur (lorsque les membres de l’UE auront transposé cette loi dans leur loi nationale) en mai 2018. Au Royaume-Uni, l’Investigatory Powers Act (UK) 2016 a systématiquement incorporé une approche à ce contrôle statutaire par l’entremise de tests de proportionnalité et de nécessité sur les pouvoirs conférés à la sécurité nationale en matière d’interception, de communication, d’accès, de collection et de gestion de quantité massive de données (connus sous le nom de « Bulk powers »). Ce contrôle a pour but de créer des mesures appropriées pour la protection de la vie privée pour les individus qui sont intentionnellement ou involontairement ciblés. Ainsi, le droit semble s’éveiller. Toutefois, un cadre réglementaire exhaustif et systématique de contrôle et de protection n’a pas encore été instauré. Cet article propose une approche en étages verticaux qui pourraient être mis en œuvre séparément ou ensemble. Cet article est divisé en deux parties. La première partie donne de l’information sur l’interface entre les développements en technologie et notre non-consentement à la « datafication » de notre santé personnelle, à partir de laquelle, à notre insu, les algorithmes de tierces parties créent notre identité digitale. La deuxième partie émet une proposition qui envisage un cadre légal en quatre temps pour la protection des données identifiables sur la santé. Les protections à chaque étage seraient discrètes mais capables d’intégration. À la base – au niveau de la conception – il est possible pour les ingénieurs informatiques et les programmeurs informatiques de spécifier des algorithmes d’instructions définis de façon précise pour traiter les données personnelles conformément aux lois sur la confidentialité et les standards éthiques. Au niveau suivant – les opérateurs de données et les analystes (humains ou un programme algorithmique automatisé) – des tests légaux de proportionnalité et de nécessité et de conduite éthique pourraient être mis en place par la législation et intégrés dans la conception algorithmique. Au troisième niveau – les individus et organisations qui stockent et utilisent – la responsabilité de l’intégrité, la sécurité ainsi que la confidentialité et l’éthique pourraient être gouvernés par la législation. Et au plus haut niveau, les traités internationaux pourraient établir des standards et une approche uniformes.}

The application of novel technologies such as pervasive sensing, widespread internet of the things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics aims to sense, calculate, and actuate by employing data-driven architectures and automated decisions for reaching more efficient processes that reduce environmental impacts and transform manpower workloads. This work introduces a cyber-physical system (CPS) towards more innovative operations within the mining industry’s mine-to-mill process, whereby the operations’ decision-making and executions are often done by human intelligence. However, the increasing use of autonomous machines or mechatronics (MEC) such as trucks, drills, drones, and conveyor belts, combined with advanced modelling and solving algorithms (MSA), can achieve the necessary autonomous operations for handling such hazards and harsh environments, where no or reduced manpower is required. For that, information and computing technologies (ICT) facilitate innovative solutions to re-shape and re-design production systems. The interplaying of advanced technologies of the I4 mandate and circular economy (CE) ideology towards the mines of the future creates a smart connected mining industry that embeds vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent systems. This paper discusses how I4’s technological developments in mining sector applications generate opportunities to re-design and re-execute stockpiling to conveyor-belt processes into enhanced production states from a CE perspective (environmental, economic, and social). CE theories within I4-S5 offer innovative sustainable industrial concepts driven by safer, more environmentally friendly towards precision and autonomous mining.}

Based on qualitative research methods, this study analyzes pandemic prevention policy documents issued during the pandemic by China's national economic and technological development zones and their localities to reflect the complete process of governance. The findings indicate that a mandatory policy network, guided by a local governance framework, facilitated the rapid achievement of collaboration in development zones in responding to the crisis. Top-down leadership developed over time in the public sector, and the responsiveness and innovation of enterprises and social organizations played an important role in collaborative governance.

The aim of this research is to develop a framework for the integration of BIM and structure verification to improve the application of BIM in road engineering and thus reduce the mistake and repetition in pavement design. Relying on the capabilities of Dynamo, a three-dimensional road model with pavement controllable parameters was first established. Successful implementation of this step can facilitate the designer with more flexible and convenient needs in design process. Secondly, a subroutine is developed based on Python to combine Dynamo with the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) which provides the pavement structure analysis. As a response to long-term development between BIM and road engineering, this paper contributes by offering innovative and practical solutions for integration of road design and pavement analysis, which effectively solves the long-existing defect that the pavement structure cannot be analyzed in the environment of BIM, and thus, will significantly promote the further application of BIM technology in the road industry.}

Moreover, with the utilization of VR, engineers are capable of visualizing the simulation results from the Digital Twin and collaborate with their colleagues for improving new product designs. Towards this direction, the contribution of this research work is focused on the design and development of a framework for including customers in the design phase of new products under the mass personalization paradigm. The Digital Twin of the new product will accept as input information regarding the user-defined requirements, as well as data from previous similar design cases. Through the development of a VR application, engineers can visualize the simulation results and remotely collaborate during the design of new products. Finally, the development of an Augmented Reality (AR) application for the requirement elicitation from customers and the visualization of simulation results is provisioned.}

The new generation of Southeast Asian Chinese society, who were locally born and grew up, have largely weakened their interaction with China. However, the growing business opportunities presented from the Belt and Road Initiative (the BRI), which was launched in 2013, serve as a big impetus for the new generation entrepreneurs to reengage China. Drawn upon an empirical case study of the new generation of Malaysian Chinese entrepreneurs, this paper argues that, the entrepreneurs regard institutional embeddedness as a critical channel to enhance their abilities to accumulate transnational social capital and strengthen their socio-economic networks with China. The transnational networks facilitate them to seize business opportunities from the BRI, and simultaneously reinforce their Malaysian national identity. Moreover, this study demonstrates the emergence of knowledge networks in the transnational space. It not only reflects the increasing interests of the new generation entrepreneurship in China's innovation and technology, but also reveals the developmental strategies of both the Malaysian and Chinese states.}

The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda. Critical perspectives are also offered for future practitioners.}

Although blockchain and machine learning technologies (especially deep learning and deep reinforcement learning) may provide the next promising use case for IIoT, they are working in an adversarial way to some extent. While blockchain facilitates the data collection that is critical for machine learning under the premise of data regulation rules like privacy protection, it may suffer from privacy leakage due to big data analytics with the help of machine learning. To make machine learning and blockchain useful and practical for diversified services in industrial sectors, it is of paramount importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the development of both technologies in the context of IIoT. To this end, in this paper we summarize and analyze the applications of blockchain and machine learning in IIoT from three important aspects, i.e., consensus mechanism, storage and communication. This survey provides a deeper understanding on the security and privacy risks of the key components of a blockchain from the perspective of machine learning, which is useful in the design of practical blockchain solutions for IIoT. In addition, we provide useful guidance for future research in the area by identifying interesting open problems that need to be addressed before large-scale deployments of IIoT applications are practicable.}

However, many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, do not apply the technology, because the generation of a digital twin in a built environment is cost-, time- and resource-intensive and IT expertise is required. These obstacles will be overcome by generating a digital twin using a scan of the shop floor and subsequent object recognition. This paper describes the approach with multiple steps, parameters, and data which must be acquired in order to generate a digital twin automatically. It is also shown how the data is processed to generate the digital twin and how object recognition is integrated into it. An overview of the entire process chain is given as well as results in an application case.}

To ensure potential affordances are leveraged and potential limitations and risks are identified and addressed, a structured approach for identifying opportunities and challenges for people, plant and procedures could be beneficial. A literature review revealed that for process safety management there is a gap associated with exploring the utility of frameworks that facilitate a structured approach for thinking about data, information, knowledge and wisdom from a people, plant and procedures perspective. This article explores work done to answer the research question – Can the data-information-knowledge-wisdom-action (DIKWA) cycle and people-plant-procedures (P3) model help identify important considerations associated with ‘Big Data’ applications within the process industries especially in terms of process safety management? We apply these frameworks to an industry case study on high temperature hydrogen attack and find that it revealed insights into options for and affordances and limitations associated with adopting ‘Big Data’ technology and tools. The implications of these insights for process safety management are discussed then recommendations are made about future research which includes the need to use this work to inform the development of a useful and usable knowledge processing model for process safety applications.}

WHO has recommended the use of such imaging devices in 2021 and many partnerships have helped propose benchmark analysis and technology comparisons to facilitate their “market access”. Our aim is to examine the socio-political and health issues that stem from using AI-CAD technology in a global health context conceptualized as a set of practice and ideas organizing global intervention “in the life of others”. We also question how this technology, which is not yet fully implemented in routine use, may limit or amplify some inequalities in the care of tuberculosis. We describe AI-CAD through Actor-Network-Theory framework to understand the global assemblage and composite activities associated with detection through AI-CAD, and interrogate how the technology itself may consolidate a specific configuration of “global health”. We explore the various dimensions of AI-CAD “health effects model”: technology design, development, regulation, institutional competition, social interaction and health cultures. On a broader level, AI-CAD represents a new version of global health's accelerationist model centered on “moving and autonomous-presumed technologies”. We finally present key aspects in our research which help discuss the theories mobilized: AI-CAD ambivalent insertion in global health, the social lives of its data: from efficacy to markets and AI-CAD human care and maintenance it requires. We reflect on the conditions that will affect AI-CAD use and its promises. In the end, the risk of new detection technologies such as AI-CAD is indeed that the fight against TB could be reduced to one that is purely technical and technological, with neglect to its social determinants and effects.}

Current research reveals that co-production-based interfaces dominated neither by knowledge producers nor policymakers succeed in facilitating the transformation of knowledge into politics. From this point of view, this paper explores how Izmir Development Agency (IZKA), a regional development agency in Turkey, utilizes scientific knowledge and science-policy interfaces in its activities on climate change. Based on the analysis of agency documents and semi-structured interviews with experts from and outside IZKA, the findings indicate that IZKA thrives in integrating scientific knowledge on climate change in its activities drawing from multi-stakeholder and multi-level science-policy interfaces that have significant similarities with the co-production model. In these interfaces, international, national, regional, and local stakeholders share their resources, knowledge, and experience on climate change. Although legal, geographical, and demographic conditions also have an impact, the main reason behind IZKA’s success is the agency’s climate-focused vision that shapes decisions, strategies, organizational structure, and activities. In parallel to the indicated finding, this paper also discloses that the perspective of not prioritizing climate change and considering the potential benefits as only “co-benefit” does not yield results with the desired efficiency. Another finding is that even though the national government is the main actor on climate in Turkey, development agencies are capable of carrying out transformative activities in their regions, albeit limited.}

Both concepts have an enormous impact on all aspects of life, not in the least quality of life. This chapter provides a brief history to prove the challenge of health and well-being in the built environment. It provides a strong integration of sustainability and health with intelligence as this is needed in the years ahead. The combination of urban intelligence and digital twins as a planning tool to optimize the performance of cities and communities coveys the message that urbanization requires artificial intelligence by using smart technologies and data-driven planning solutions to enhance human and nature intelligence, not to replace them. This approach requires a holistic partnership that promotes human-centric design and intelligence into the built environment to address infrastructure challenges in cities and facilitate sustainability, health, pandemic response, adaptability, therapy, and knowledge.}

However, it has been a long-standing challenge due to the complex building shading effects and diversified rooftop availabilities. To overcome the challenge, this study proposed a novel 3D-geographic information system (GIS) and deep learning integrated approach, in which a 3D-GIS-based solar irradiance analyzer was developed to predict dynamic rooftop solar irradiance by taking shading effects of surrounding buildings into account. A deep learning framework was developed to identify the rooftop availabilities. Experimental validations have shown their high accuracies. As a case study, a real urban region of Hong Kong was used. The results showed that the annual solar energy potential of the entire building group was reduced by 35.7% due to the shading effect and the reduced rooftop availability. The reductions of individual buildings varied from 13.4% to 74.5%. In spite of the substantial reductions of the annual solar energy, the shading effect could only slightly reduce the peak solar power. In fact, the annual solar energy reduction could be five times higher than the peak solar power reduction. Further analysis showed that simple addition of the respective solar energy potential reductions, caused by the shading effect and the rooftop availability, tends to highly overestimate the total reduction by up to 26%. For this reason, their impacts cannot be considered separately but as joint effects. The integrated approach provides a viable means to accurately characterize rooftop solar energy potential in urban regions, which can help facilitate solar energy applications in high-density cities.}

The SISE development requires considering the service requirement from both the complex industrial context and service ecosystem manners. This study proposes a systematic framework for stakeholder requirement evaluation in SISE. The first part of the framework is the industrial context-viable system model with ecological thinking (IC-VESM) to elicit the service requirements for the SISE, which facilitates a systematic analysis of the service value proposition and service requirement elicitation in the operational lifecycle of an entire industrial context. This second part of the framework proposes a method for evaluating service requirements that is both feasible and systematic. This is achieved by combining the Fuzzy Kano and AHP methods in a Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) environment. The PF Kano computes the categories and determines the weights of service requirements from a consumer perspective, while the PF AHP hierarchically analyzes the service requirements and provides pairwise comparison paths for design experts. Finally, an illustrative case study in a renewable energy context was used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. The proposed theoretical model provides more reliable and systematic outcomes than traditional methods when eliciting service requirements and evaluating complex smart industrial service solutions. The study has practical implications by providing useful insights for companies to recognize key smart service requirements in complex industrial contexts and to improve sustainable development.}

We combined SSM with interviews, media content analysis and focus groups made possible by snowballing. The responses were analyzed using rich pictures and validated through a conceptual model. The results reveal a fragmented government where ministries, agencies, and personalities assert power in single window implementation through I.T. vendor contracts. The situation results in a high cost of doing business at the port for shippers due to non-transparent and questionable contracts. The public’s attitude towards the controversies reflects fears, hopes and expectations and legitimate concerns about important political and social goals. Using SSMs focus on relations and attitudes, we can document how controversies attributed to new technology is not a question of technology but of perceived political interference.}

Thus, we identify 73 quantitative peer-reviewed empirical studies in this field and categorize them according to a legitimacy-theory-based framework. Our four main contributions offer new insights into this emerging research field and provide guidance for the development of new research models: First, we help future researchers to structure this emerging field of research with respect to the interactions of the phenomenon itself (carbon performance vs. disclosure), its determinants (country- and firm-related governance), and its financial consequences (value relevance, information asymmetry, financial performance, and cost of capital). Second, we provide a comprehensive overview of variables and proxies used in the studies and list their main statistical effects, which facilitates building novel models. There are indications that 1) board composition positively influences both carbon performance and disclosure, 2) carbon performance and carbon disclosure are positively connected, 3) carbon disclosure reduces information asymmetry, and 4) carbon performance increases financial performance. Third, we develop a research agenda with concise suggestions for future studies. Fourth, we argue that due to the under-theorization of concepts the comparability of included studies is challenging, this research field may be characterized as a vibrant field for extensive future research.}

We find that the ecosystem, which comprises actors who hold resources and interact to coevolve, could be leveraged to facilitate a BM launch in manners beyond relying on activity-sharing synergies across BMs. Specifically, three configurations, each of which consists of a BM launch challenge, an ecosystem facet (i.e., Learning Club, Home Court, or Magnetic Field), and a leveraging strategy (i.e., Knowledge Orchestrator, Capability Bundler, or Service Aggregator), are identified to depict the associated process. Our findings offer a dynamic understanding of BM portfolio extension by integrating the actor-orientation of ecosystem and the activity-based view of BM.

However, the tiny size of the eyes makes sampling difficult and invasive studies costly and ethically constrained. Developing ocular formulations following conventional trial-and-error formulation and manufacturing process screening procedures is inefficient. Along with the popularity of computational pharmaceutics, non-invasive in silico modeling & simulation offer new opportunities for the paradigm shift of ocular formulation development. The current work first systematically reviews the theoretical underpinnings, advanced applications, and unique advantages of data-driven machine learning and multiscale simulation approaches represented by molecular simulation, mathematical modeling, and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling for ocular drug development. Following this, a new computer-driven framework for rational pharmaceutical formulation design is proposed, inspired by the potential of in silico explorations in understanding drug delivery details and facilitating drug formulation design. Lastly, to promote the paradigm shift, integrated in silico methodologies were highlighted, and discussions on data challenges, model practicality, personalized modeling, regulatory science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and talent training were conducted in detail with a view to achieving more efficient objective-oriented pharmaceutical formulation design.}

This study seeks to investigate the exposure to different risks presented by the built environments of current neighbourhoods and the valuation of the benefits attained through the development of lifetime neighbourhoods. Ambient assisted living technologies embedded in lifetime neighbourhoods can significantly decrease the risk of falls and other accidents. Digital social networks and other support to the community can facilitate inclusion and mitigate loneliness. The spatial planning, development, and management of lifetime neighbourhoods with embedded ambient intelligence as a risk mitigation strategy in fast ageing cities are of specific interest. We wish to evaluate how the development of lifetime neighbourhoods mitigates the risk of accidents and social exclusion, thereby creating value for the community. The creation of value by the mitigation of the risk of falls, diseases, and social exclusion will be measured with the actuarial present value generated using the multiple decrement model approach, which is a novelty. The actuarial present value will provide scientific evidence of the benefits of the development and management of various lifetime neighbourhoods and housing arrangements.}

Nevertheless, transitioning from the “electronic” to the stage of “transformational” domain – coined as t-Government – is posing the greatest challenge of how government services respond to changes in the broader economy and society. Despite considerable investments and the wide use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), research literature on e-Government suggests that government services have yet to reach the full potential of seamless integration, where all transactions are completed electronically. Through a detailed analysis of the extant e-Government literature and a case study based empirical research, this paper explores the domain of e-Government in identifying the possible reasons for this potential shortfall in achieving full integration. Furthermore, the paper intends to highlight an aspect of complexity surrounding crossing the integration gap as the authors denote by “eChasm” in the e-Government conceptual model that leads to transformation. In addition, it focuses on radical change through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and the call for strategic style of leadership, for cross-agency collaboration leading to a successful realisation of transformational government (t-Government). It is interesting to note that researchers and public sector leaders have started to realise that implementing and managing the transformation of public services, copiously satisfying the users and stakeholders, is a task of multi-dimensional complexity.}

Electronic health records (EHRs) are transforming and revolutionizing the healthcare industry. However, whereas developed countries have a high EHR penetration rate, adoption of EHRs in developing countries is lagging behind. Recently, the Korean and Russian governments have been pursuing economic cooperation in the Russian Far East. Thus, since 2009, Russia’s EHR market and healthcare system have been maturing in tandem.
Objective
To qualitatively investigate and analyze the current status of EHRs in the Russian Far East and derive implementation plans for nationwide EHRs.
Methods
A qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and administrative officers in the Russian Far East was conducted to illuminate the current status of EHRs and to collect various perspectives on barriers and facilitators to implementation.
Results
The analysis revealed six major barriers and five major facilitators for implementation of nationwide EHRs in the Russian Far East. The barriers include lack of communications, an insufficient system development environment, poor adoption of standard terminology, poor infrastructure, resistance to a new system, and poor functionality. Facilitators include strategic government planning, centrally managed systems, health information exchange, willingness to use new functions, and well-established work processes.
Conclusions
This study’s results, along with the experiences of developed countries that have already successfully introduced EHRs, will help support successful introduction of EHRs in the Russian Far East.}

Although the advantages of applying DLT in construction projects are numerous, several barriers and limitations are associated with its application. The difficulties are even more exacerbated when examining the uses of DLT for achieving more sustainable buildings. In this context, this article conducts a comprehensive literature review on blockchain, the most discussed DLT technology nowadays, for sustainability, focusing on extending key applications discussed in various fields to the construction industry and real estate. The novelty of this review paper is the presentation of an in-depth discussion of what the next steps in blockchain research should be in order to integrate its applications for achieving a sustainable construction environment with cleaner production and resource use efficiency. A conceptual framework is also proposed to showcase the integration of blockchain with other applications for facilitating the goal of achieving sustainable buildings, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA).}

However, existing research on CRBCs primarily focuses on outcome-based sustainability analysis, neglecting production-based evaluation. To bridge this gap, our study investigates sustainability of CRBC using the inclusive wealth index (IWI), IWI per capita, and IWI density. We find substantial variations in CRBCs' inclusive wealth influenced by regional distribution and life stages. Regionally, sustainable development capacity follows the sequence “east > west > central > northeast”, with the northern region benefiting from abundant non-renewable natural capital. In terms of life stage sustainable development, the sequence is “growing > regenerative > grown-up > recessionary”. The decline in wealth performance from growing to recessionary types confirms the negative impact of the “resource curse” phenomenon, where resource dependence hampers growth. However, the regenerative type demonstrates the potential for transformation through sustainable development strategies. Our study presents practical strategies to enhance regional policies by adopting the IWI accounting indicator system proposed by the United Nations Environment Programme and localizing it to align with the characteristics of CRBCs in China. This innovative approach facilitates the evaluation of CRBCs' sustainable development performance.}

Currently, most companies tend to outsource productive resources, taking advantage of the virtualization capacity of their jobs, thanks to the extensive coverage of connectivity networks deployed in cities. This situation facilitates the entry of new agents that can solve this growing demand into the market. In this chapter, we analyze the different business platforms capable of implementing compatible self-employment activities, to facilitate labor insertion through sustainable and quality self-employment that responds to the demand for services in cities.}

Blockchain is a promising technology that provides immutable and traceable data storage with a decentralized architecture. However, the transparency of blockchain conflicts with the confidentiality nature of cost information. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework based on blockchain and encryption to preserve both data accountability and confidentiality in construction cost management. The proposed new framework involves the development of a cost data model containing the required confidential cost information to facilitate partially transparent recordings on the blockchain. An access control model based on symmetric and asymmetric encryption as well as proxy re-encryption mechanisms is developed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive cost data on the blockchain and transfer data access in dynamic construction projects (i.e., construction projects involving new members continuously). Subsequently, encryption-integrated smart contracts are developed for automatic and secure cost activities on the blockchain. The framework is validated with a desirable latency (at the millisecond level), throughput (at the hundred level), and storage cost (at the MB level) in three illustrative cost management scenarios. The results indicate that project members can have accountable and confidential cost data for dispute resolution and cost analysis, respectively, as well as efficient cost data access transfer.}

Although similar in physical appearance to pedestrians, e-scooter riders follow distinctly different characteristics of movement and can reach speeds of up to 45 kmph. The challenge of detecting e-scooter riders is exacerbated in urban environments where the frequency of partial occlusion is increased as riders navigate between vehicles, traffic infrastructure and other road users. This can lead to the non-detection or mis-classification of e-scooter riders as pedestrians, providing inaccurate information for accident mitigation and path planning in autonomous vehicle applications. This research introduces a novel benchmark for partially occluded e-scooter rider detection to facilitate the objective characterization of detection models. A novel, occlusion-aware method of e-scooter rider detection is presented that achieves a 15.93% improvement in detection performance over the current state of the art.}

abstract = {Introduction
Dementia is characterized by global cognitive dysfunction, which can cause difficulties in performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), leaving people with dementia (PwD) who do not have the proper support extremely vulnerable. Dementia management should involve preventative methods, including during the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Lay-caregivers are found to have poorer health in all three domains of the biopsychosocial model, as a result of the burden of care. New assistive technologies (ATs) have been designed to help care for PwD. ATs aim to be more affordable and widely available than human workers, achieving greater health equity and quality of life for all.
Methods
To identify relevant articles, a literature search using PubMed was undertaken by one independent reviewer: S.L.C. The keywords of “dementia”, “technology”, and “management” were used, with no date of publication limitations, which revealed 571 results.
Results
44 articles were included in this review. Articles regarding new technologies to diagnose dementia or MCI were not included. ATs aim to help facilitate aging-in-place, reduce medical costs, and rates of caregiver burnout, by helping maintain patient functioning.
Discussion
Legal issues in the form of workplace safety laws, data privacy laws and regulations, and health care ethics are major barriers to implementation that need to be resolved. The hope is that artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be able to advance what they are able to perceive and help uncover new knowledge and management options for dementia and MCI.}

abstract = {This article discusses a number of key issues concerning simulation-based digital twins in the domain of multistage processes. Almost all production processes are multistage in nature, and so most digital twins involve multiple physical phenomena, process steps and different solvers for the simulations. Good interoperability between model solvers and processes are key to achieving a functional digital twin. Passing information between steps can be challenging, complex and time consuming, especially for material data, because the constitutive model interacts with the full modeling environment: material behavior is interdependent with the history of the process, the solver subroutines and the boundary conditions. This work proposes a flexible yet robust standardization approach, called FlexMM, for dealing with material data, constitutive models, measurement data or mathematical models to overcome part of the abovementioned complexity. The implementation of FlexMM consists of a general rule structure in which constitutive behavior is described, as well as its interaction with the subroutines used by the finite element solver. The definition of the constitutive model is stored in a separate file, in which the material behavior can be described in a user selected format, such as look-up tables, standard statistical models, machine learning or analytical expressions. After a calculation step, the new local material properties are mapped to a file to facilitate the next history-dependent step. In this way, the interaction between the different fabrication steps and processes can be incorporated. A material/process case study is presented to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of FlexMM.}

An e-health two-sided market needs to offer sustainable structures, i.e., an ecosystem to support a flexible model that must meet unexpected demand and at the same time be able to handle high demand peaks and long periods if needed. In this chapter we introduce key concepts and factors that are of relevance in two-sided markets. We further discuss the fundamental role of two-side market ecosystem in enabling parties to realize gains from trade or other interactions by reducing the transactions costs of finding each other and interacting. Hence, e-health market ecosystems first and foremost need to be designed for adaptability and network effects.

We investigate these research questions by utilizing probabilistic machine learning models trained on thousands of expert ratings, provided by both healthcare practitioners and automation experts. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze the desirability of automating healthcare work activities (human workforce preferences) in combination with current technological capabilities. We present a succinct four quadrant model, the Automatability-Desirability Matrix, based on our findings. It can be used to support policymakers and organizational leaders in developing practical strategies on how to harness the positive power of AI, while accompanying change and empowering stakeholders in a participatory fashion. Furthermore, we observe that healthcare professionals desire a surprisingly high proportion of their work activities to be fully automated, while being less optimistic about the current automation potential of healthcare work than technical experts. Our results represent the first detailed quantitative empirical evidence of healthcare practitioners’ preferences regarding the automation of work and the first direct comparison of the potential for automation as based on the perspectives of technical experts and those working as healthcare practitioners.}

abstract = {For many years, transatlantic cooperation between the EU and the US in the area of personal data exchange has been a subject of special interest on the part of lawmakers, courts – including supranational ones – NGOs and the public. When implementing recent reform of data protection law, the European Union decided to further strengthen guarantees of the protection of privacy in cyberspace. At the same time, however, it faced the practical problem of how to ensure compliance with these principles in relation to third countries. The approach proposed in the GDPR, which is based on a newly-defined territorial scope of application, clearly indicates an attempt to apply EU rules extraterritorially in relation to data processors in third countries. Irrespective of EU activity, the United States has also introduced its own regulations addressing the same problem. An example is the federal law adopted in 2018, specifying how to execute national court orders for the transfer of electronic data. The CLOUD Act was established in response to legal doubts raised in the Microsoft v United States case regarding the transfer of electronic data stored in the cloud by US obliged entities to law enforcement authorities, as well as in cases where this data is physically located in another country and its transfer could result in violating the legal norms of a foreign jurisdiction. The CLOUD Act also facilitates bilateral international agreements that enable the cross-border transfer of e-evidence for the purposes of ongoing criminal proceedings. Both the content of the new regulations and the model proposed by the US legislature for future agreements concluded on the basis of the CLOUD Act can be seen as an alternative to regulations arising from EU law. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the CLOUD Act and CLOUD Act Agreements from the perspective of EU law and, in particular, attempt to answer the question as to whether this new legal mechanism brings the EU and the USA closer to finding common ground with regard to a coherent model of exchange and protection of personal data.}

abstract = {Background
Reducing waste, improving quality, boosting treatment efficacy, and providing safe patient-centered health care are the top priorities for most healthcare organizations. A reliable incident reporting system is a method that can help decision-makers stay aware of any incidents that violate patient safety guidelines, examine the probable causes, and come up with new policies that can prevent future patient safety violations.
Methods
In this study, we present our newly developed electronic Occurrence Variance Reporting system (eOVR), made specifically for low-income countries with a cost as low as 5 USD/month, along with the steps required for the reporting and the potential benefits to the whole healthcare system. This system was developed using a third-party application, AppSheet, which provides already established customizable forms that would help any hospital to develop its reporting system without the need for programming experts or the expensive infrastructure needed for it.
Results
Our system is composed of three main stages that allow the participating members to report, taking a decision, and evaluating the need for further actions. We implemented a mixture of electronic tools designed to fulfill the purpose of reporting incidents and facilitating the analysis of the system gaps, especially in times of crisis using an incident report that can be generated automatically and immediately using this system.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first electronic model of OVR developed to be used in individual hospitals in low-income countries without the need for expensive infrastructure or hiring a professional programmer. This model could save time and offer more flexibility and versatility to both the incident reporter and the decision-makers. Lastly, offering a low-cost solution, as low as 5 USD/month, would encourage the hospitals to participate in incident reporting, as well as enhance the digitalization process in low-income countries.}

Addressing an industry need for improved knowledge sharing and collaboration, the BIM Safety Risk library tool aligns with a Prevention through Design (PtD) approach that links safety risks to treatments via different risk scenarios. Motivated by continuing sub-optimal health and safety management processes, the research employs a conceptual framework rooted in construction guidance: structuring data via a 7-stage ontology to improve designer knowledge of issues and give access to an expanding safety knowledge base (the BIM Safety Risk Library). The tool facilitates tacit and explicit knowledge sharing in visual environments, enabling the construction industry to benefit from their health and safety data while providing an interactive learning tool for designers. The structuring of data also opens up possibilities for other digital advances (e.g. via automatic rule checking).}

That is why various countries have set up plans to move towards the Circular Economy (CE) leading the construction sector to adopt new approaches for ensuring to close the loop of building materials. This paper explores the socio-economic and environmental barriers for the implementation of the CE, in a BIM environment. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with a range of stakeholders involved in the asset lifecycle, experts in BIM or in sustainable approaches, to understand the obstacles to the holistic consideration of the asset lifecycle in the CE context. A descriptive interpretative analysis was used for the interviews' transcripts to identify common themes and sub-themes. A pattern-matching method was used for seeking the similarities and differences between the twenty stakeholders’ views and the literature. The study shows thirty-four new barriers identified by the interviewees and not found in the literature. Recommendations are given for accelerating the asset lifecycle reconsideration and the CE embracement.}

abstract = {With data being generated at an unprecedented rate, monetizing data has become a paramount issue in this era of the digital economy. Firms have traditionally leveraged consumer data to improve their product or service offerings and increase their sales revenue, which is indirect data monetization. The recent emergence of online data markets and the data brokerage industry have facilitated direct data monetization, enabling firms to obtain additional revenue by selling their anonymized data directly to data brokers. This study develops a game-theoretic model to investigate the impact of direct data monetization on competition between firms. Our results show that in equilibrium, high-value firms with competitive advantages in product or service value often sell less data than low-value firms, implying that high-value firms rely less on direct data monetization than low-value firms. Surprisingly, as direct data monetization prevails, high-value firms further dominate the market for selling products or services, especially when the data broker's analytics capability is high. This result reveals that data brokers with high analytics capabilities can hinder, rather than facilitate, market competition. Finally, direct data monetization may benefit both consumer surplus and social welfare because it facilitates data-sharing between firms, allowing firms to obtain additional insights to improve their product or service offerings. These findings are explored in-depth, along with different model extensions and their relevant managerial implications.}

Further understanding and guidelines for firms are needed. Design thinking is a promising problem solving approach capable of facilitating the innovation process. However, design thinking does not necessarily include sustainability considerations, and it has not been sufficiently explored for application in business model innovation. Given the additional challenges posed by the need for time-efficiency and a digital environment, we have therefore developed a design thinking-based framework to guide the early development of circular business models in an online and efficient manner. We propose a new process framework called the Circular Sprint. This encompasses seven phases and contains twelve purposefully adapted activities. The framework development follows an Action Design Research approach, iteratively combining four streams of literature, feedback from sixteen experts and six workshops, and involved a total of 107 participants working in fourteen teams. The present paper describes the framework and its activities, together with evaluations of its usefulness and ease-of-use. The research shows that, while challenging, embedding sustainability, circularity and business model innovation within a design thinking process is indeed possible. We offer a flexible framework and a set of context-adaptable activities that can support innovators and practitioners in the complex process of circular business model innovation. These tools can also be used for training and educational purposes. We invite future researchers to build upon and modify our framework and its activities by adapting it to their required scenarios and purposes.

The objective of this research is to identify the value proposition, value creation, value capture and value provided to users by the healthcare 3DP service providers and to identify the resources and capabilities needed by the healthcare 3DP service providers and the clinical team to co-create value. Interviews are conducted with seven healthcare 3DP service providers, three surgeons, and a healthcare 3DP design expert along with secondary data collected from the service providers to answer the research questions. The results show that healthcare 3DP service providers utilise their exploitative capabilities while the surgeons used both explorative and exploitative capabilities to engage in the co-creation process and to create perceived value for patients. The findings also show that integrated healthcare 3DP service providers by providing knowledge, expertise, insights and training to the surgical teams are better suited to improve the absorptive capacity of hospitals to adopt 3D Printing than specialised implant developers.}

Paper is an excellent natural substrate for emerging low-cost, ecologically acceptable analytical devices. Flexibility, three-dimensional fibre structure, mechanical characteristics, ease of manufacturing and customization are the key advantages of cellulose as preferable materials for green analytical devices. This article overviews the advances in paper-based optical and electroanalytical devices, including manufacturing, validation of functions, detection methodology, and applications. The renewable resources hold the potential to accomplish the biodegradable analytical techniques due to their climate neutral waste management. The paper-based electrodes have demonstrated excellent performance for diagnostics while being eco-friendly at the same time. Therefore, the forthcoming sustainable diagnostics approaches require integrating paper-based analytical devices (PADs) built out of disposable electrodes. The diverse green materials and methods facilitate climate neural point-of-care products for the net-zero market. Numerous researches have been conducted in recent years to develop innovative technologies capable of analysing clinical samples quickly, accurately, simply, and sensitively, with the primary objective of offering competent tools for illness diagnosis and treatment efficacy follow-up. The micro-PADs show excellent abilities for quick onsite diagnostics within μ-level detection range. The sensitivity, stability, and reliability of analytical devices are the essential factors enabling larger-scale production and commercialization. The projected fabrication and analytical methods in the direction of paper-based devices could be nicely and reliably utilized for understanding and adaptation of climate neutral diagnostic technologies in healthcare sector. This detailed article discusses the sustainable framework that integrates green bioelectronics and sensor technologies adhering to diverse functionality for health and the environment. The paper-based digital technology (PDigiT) could be employed as a simple, cost-effective, and efficient net-zero technology for real-time monitoring of outbreaks and bio-surveillance.}

In order to explore the reuse opportunities offered by IoT frameworks we have performed a case study and analyzed 503 components reused by 35 IoT projects. We examined (a) the types of functionality that are most facilitated for reuse (b) the reuse strategy that is most adopted (c) thequality of the reused components. The results of the case study suggest that the main functionality reused is the one related to the Device Management layer and that Black-box reuse is the main type. Moreover, the quality of the reused components is improved compared to the rest of the components built from scratch.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of things (IoT) are progressively entering our daily lives, from food, medicine, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment to smart manufacturing, smart security, and smart retail. In this chapter, we discuss the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) (AI+IoT) to analyze the objectives of future smart city construction in Taiwan and explain the supporting technologies. Subsequently, we detail the technical framework of a future smart city and use information collected by the IoT through the AI open collaboration mechanism to discuss model evaluation and optimization, which provide functions such as AI application and facilitating interactive relationships. Next, we analyze the needs of future smart cities and the advantages and challenges they bring. The future development of smart cities in Taiwan that are under planning is then analyzed, and the formation, operation, and development of the smart city system are revealed.}

abstract = {South Korea became the first country in the world to launch a nationwide 5G network and commercialize 5G services. The Korean government played an essential role in the development of 5G, creating a tailored institutional arrangement that allowed South Korea to be at the forefront of 5G. In particular, the government set up a detailed time plan on how to go about 5G deployment and commercialization. The government also facilitated collaborative work between companies, research institutes, and academia, and strongly promoted R&D work for the development of 5G equipment, devices, and applications, providing financial and administrative support, opportunities for field trials, and various forms of incentive, including tax benefits to companies. This study analyzed the 5G socio-technical system in South Korea through the lens of technology systems theory, identifying and discussing crucial factors that have propelled 5G development and major latent aspects, such as the lack of killer applications for consumers and in vertical industries, which may potentially hinder the further growth and stabilization of the 5G system in South Korea.}

abstract = {This study examines the effect of digitalization on the internationalization of new ventures and further investigates the influence of a home country's presence of institutional voids and digital infrastructure on the extent of internationalization by new ventures, with the prediction that a home country's institutional voids and a weak digital infrastructure strengthen the positive relationship between new ventures' digitalization and internationalization. Applying multilevel modeling on a sample of more than 6000 entrepreneurs from 62 countries the study offers empirical support for these predictions. The findings are robust to alternative specifications. Entrepreneurs using the internet to sell their products and services are more likely to focus on customers in foreign markets when they face institutional voids and a lack of digital infrastructure in their home countries. The study contributes as follows: From a theoretical view, it provides a better understanding of the boundary conditions of the digitalization-new venture internationalization linkage. From a practical perspective, the findings of the study suggest the complementary roles of institutional voids and digital infrastructure at home to help entrepreneurs grow domestically and facilitate their internationalization.}

abstract = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in risk-sensitive environments is still in its infancy because it lacks a systematic framework for reasoning about risk, uncertainty, and their potentially catastrophic consequences. In high-impact applications, inference on risk and uncertainty will become decisive in the adoption of AI/ML systems. To this end, there is a pressing need for a consolidated understanding on the varied risks arising from AI/ML systems, and how these risks and their side effects emerge and unfold in practice. In this paper, we provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of a broad array of inherent risks that can arise in AI/ML systems. These risks are grouped into two categories: data-level risk (e.g., data bias, dataset shift, out-of-domain data, and adversarial attacks) and model-level risk (e.g., model bias, misspecification, and uncertainty). In addition, we highlight the research needs for developing a holistic framework for risk management dedicated to AI/ML systems to hedge the corresponding risks. Furthermore, we outline several research related challenges and opportunities along with the development of risk-aware AI/ML systems. Our research has the potential to significantly increase the credibility of deploying AI/ML models in high-stakes decision settings for facilitating safety assurance, and preventing systems from unintended consequences.}

abstract = {The notion of Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) and similar concepts using different acronyms emerged as a major paradigm shift to facilitate the interaction between human and Cyber-Physical System (CPS). However, human interaction behaviour is the result of multiple social dimensions governed by complex environmental, cultural and contextual factors which are not yet fully understood. Additionally, works in this direction still lack a well established systemic foundation. Thus, handling properly the social factor in Human-CPS interaction remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a new perspective and a formalisation for the CPSS paradigm, which is grounded on the theory of systems. The aim of this is to provide a general framework to handle social dimensions in Human-CPS interactions. We propose a meta-model, which provides a conceptual ground to design CPSS spaces where CPS are enhanced with social capabilities.}

abstract = {The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is one of the most used by large-scale companies Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks. It contains the Architecture Development Method (ADM) to represent knowledge used to analyze and build the EA for an organization. It is a very detailed method and covers all phases of EA construction and maintenance. However, the described guidelines are hard to follow as they are rich and numerous. Our goal is to provide a process-based knowledge representation of the ADM method to better guide EA professionals using TOGAF and to facilitate the TOGAF teaching with students. In our previous work, we have already proposed the process-oriented graphical representation of the requirements management (RM) phase of TOGAF-ADM. In this work, we carried out a questionnaire to evaluate the process representation of the TOGAF-ADM RM phase in comparison with its textual representation issue from the TOGAF documentation. The obtained results confirmed that process models are helpful to better represent the knowledge included in TOGAF-ADM textual guidelines; thus, practitioners have a more complete description of how to proceed while using TOGAF.}

abstract = {As Industry 4.0 technologies are increasing in manufacturing, more and more applications emerge, covering different aspects of product lifecycle. Following the digitization trend that characterized the last decades, manufacturers integrate Information and communications technologies in their approaches that support their progression towards this new era. New solutions that facilitate the integration of customers in the product design and manufacturing, integrating unique regional requirements become part of the standard design procedure followed by modern manufacturing. The wide infiltration of mobile devices in end- users’ life creates an open stream of valuable data that may affect product design and drive the design of manufacturing networks. To support this process, it is important to classify the novel integrations that act on different parts of the lifecycle using state of the art Industry 4.0 architectures, facilitating manufacturers to keep track on how its development may affect their production. This paper presents how a set of tools designed to integrate customers in the product design and manufacturing that consider Industry 4.0 technologies may be classified using the RAMI 4.0 architecture. The tools affect different parts of the product’s lifecycle, connecting the end-user with the product design and manufacturing network design and RAMI 4.0 was selected to model the information flow between the different levels that provide increased sustainability that benefits both the manufacturer and the customers. Classifying the tools using standardized models aims to support their integration in future developments that consider Internet of Things. The aforementioned tools are applied in a refrigerator production use case provided by a large white goods manufacturer.}
