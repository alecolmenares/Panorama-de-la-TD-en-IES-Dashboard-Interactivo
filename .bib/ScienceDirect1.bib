This study aims to determine and analyze different DT strategies (DTSs) with the help of an integrated SWOT-based fuzzy AHP-MARCOS methodology that is proposed for the first time in the literature for this purpose. This methodology is validated with a case study concerning the airline industry in Turkey. The weights of the SWOT factors are determined with the fuzzy AHP method. The fuzzy MARCOS approach is used to select the most suitable DTS. The most appropriate strategy is obtained as “focusing on differentiated digital customer experience and service quality by the adaptation of business models to DT to provide benefits”.}

However, the experience and challenges of the Saudi healthcare system in adopting digital transformation have received little attention in the literature. Thus, this chapter aims to provide an overview of the digital transformation process in the Saudi healthcare system. The authors also shed light on the major challenges and suggested technology-based solutions. This chapter was written in light of the available global and local literature discussing the digitization of the health sector. Moreover, the Saudi governmental documents and official reports were utilized to include the latest updates and future plans for the local digital transformation strategy. In paving the way toward digital transformation, many challenges have been faced in areas such as medical records unification, technical infrastructure, and workforce capability. Solutions such as telemedicine applications, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and blockchain have been gradually applied to achieve the goal of transformation by 2030. Saudi Arabia's digital transformation began in 2018, with the implementation of the Vision 2030’s rapid digital change. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, a leap in utilizing digital health solutions has been noticed locally. Nevertheless, more action plans are needed to address the challenges and implement suitable solutions accordingly.}

abstract = {Greening, Digitizing and Redefining Aims in an Uncertain and Finite World: the triad facing the world in the immediate future as climate change, pandemic, digitization and the scramble for energy resources mark the challenges of an uncertain and finite world.
Purpose
Keeping in line with previous research on the social, commercial, and industrial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper has a dual objective: to extend the analysis in a common time frame by exploring additional indicators based on existing data sources and to analyse the relationships between EIDaD and R&D, comparing the pre- and post-COVID-19 scenarios.
Methodology
Numerous primary data sources within multiple available databases were studied, such as the EU dataset. These sources provide a range of indicators which, despite the scarcity of available literature, facilitate an empirical approach involving the quantitative analysis of the information they contain. A set of subsequent correlation analyses during Pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 were elaborated in order to explore the possible relationships between selected variables.
Structure
Previous research has shown that the IDR dataset facilitates the identification of early indicators of EIDaD and the expansion of EIDaD-related early indicators to key business ratios. This in turn allows comparisons between EIDaD and R&D to offer additional insight into how organizations can change the approach of their R&D and investment initiatives from reactive to proactive.
Findings
This paper sheds light on how R&D investments impact EIDaD initiatives and strongly suggests that organizations rethink how they approach entrepreneurship, innovation, digitization and digital transformation, using early indicators to facilitate better long-term decisions.
Originality
This paper shows that certain pre-pandemic strategic activities, such as R&D investments, may have influenced the behaviour of businesses, customers and society during the pandemic, and how wealth and economic value can be generated in a post-pandemic environment in the framework of a new economic model.
Practical implications
Organizations that succeed during a pandemic will serve as leadership models for the next generation of businesses, shaping the future of society as a whole. When early R&D investments bring about changes in the metrics that influence the recovery from the impact of a pandemic, they enhance the growth that can create jobs and offer new business opportunities in the new digital context.}

abstract = {As GovTech solutions are steadily entering the public sector, they have yet to find their way into the mainstream literature. GovTech refers to socio-technical solutions – that are developed and operated by private organisations – intertwined with public sector components for facilitating processes in the public sector. GovTech solutions promise a superior customer journey for citizens and businesses compared to current government portals and front desks. GovTech solutions can be a blessing in disguise for governments struggling in their digital transformation journey, carrying the burden of public service innovation and replacing legacy systems with modern GovTech solutions. Yet, there are also concerns that GovTech solutions are a Trojan horse, exploiting the lack of technical knowledge at public agencies and shifting decision-making power from public agencies to market parties, thereby undermining digital sovereignty and public values. This paper develops a research agenda for GovTech based on a conceptual framework. This framework reveals four interrelated design areas for GovTech: institutional, governance, technical and human-centred design. Governments can employ the conceptual framework to further align and develop their strategies by focussing on GovTech governance, referring to the ability to manage the various interdependencies between the four design areas.}

Yet, the use of AI in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. Prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of AI has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of AI technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of AI, particularly in public organizations. Building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop AI capabilities. To answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in Europe about factors that influence their development of AI capabilities. We collected data from 91 municipalities from three European countries (i.e., Germany, Norway, and Finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that five factors – i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support – have an impact on the development of AI capabilities. We also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of AI solutions are not important determinants of AI capability formation. Our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of AI supporting managers in public organizations to develop AI capabilities.}

The sharp resource consumption by manufacturing firms predominantly causes them to meet public demands and maximize their revenue. The United Nations (UN) has urged businesses to follow eco-friendly practices to protect and revive nature. In this regard, it is imperative to investigate which factors facilitate firms in achieving the UN sustainable development goals. Using the lens of the stakeholder theory, this study delves into investigating the role of environmental and organizational factors in firms’ green innovation and sustainable development activities. Considering the imperative role of organizational capabilities to absorb and capitalize on the knowledge, the authors took knowledge absorptive capacity (KAC) as the moderating variable in the main model. The authors received data from manufacturing firms in Turkey and analyzed it through the PLS-SEM technique. It is found that organizational and environmental factors significantly help firms achieve green innovation and sustainable development goals. Moreover, the organizational capacity to absorb knowledge bolsters the relationship between the main hypotheses. However, an insignificant moderating role of KAC was identified between environmental factors and sustainable development. Considering environmental and organizational factors as driving forces of firm performance, this study links them with green innovation and sustainable development activities by integrating KAC as an acute boundary condition. The findings provide practical implications to industrialists and stakeholders for complying with the United Nations' sustainable development goals by capitalizing on studied variables.}

The VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) in Engineering Education has to be observed, studied, analysed and reformed and that too very soon. Higher Education is unable to evolve in pace with the technological developments, global economics, and digital transformations. Global networking has shrunk the world and established inter-connectedness breaking barriers of language, geography, societal cultures, and perceptions. However such rapid changes have not impacted Engineering Education much. Academicians prophecies about attributes that an engineer should possess are turning volatile. This uncertainty leads to unemployed engineers. The chaos has emerged with various levels of complexities. With under-skilled employees, the future of the Engineers and Engineering Education looks bleak and ambiguous. Jack of all trades will have more employable possibilities than the Master of a particular skill. The faculty who teach the 21st Century Learner therefore must make a conscious, intentional choice to enhance his competencies to prepare students for the future. This study emphasizes the need to reawaken our educational policies and teaching-learning pedagogy. Certain learning strategies like flipped learning, project-based learning, problem-based learning will adapt the andragogic method. The teaching trends will be metamorphosed and establish good networking for inter/transdisciplinary research. Case studies and scenario building will churn in opportunities for the students to communicate, collaborate, critically think, and be creative. The empowered faculty will have his multi-skilled students placed well, the student will be industry ready and the industry will have the employee come along with his 21st Century skill set. The beneficiaries: the school, university, teacher now a facilitator, the student and the community at large will build not only a sustainable future but a thriving one too!}

Drawing on a case study of Ghana's paperless port digital transformation and the technology affordance theory, we address the research question: “How can digital platformisation facilitate public sector transformation?” Based on the findings and the technology affordance theory, this study develops a transformational affordance framework (TAF) and offers propositions on how digital platforms can enable public sector transformation.}

For this, integrated and efficient capture, management, sharing, and use of agricultural and environmental data from multiple sources is essential. However, there are challenges to understand and efficiently use different types of agricultural and environmental data from multiple sources, which differ in format and time interval. In this regard, the role of emerging technologies is considered to be significant for integrated data gathering, analyses and efficient use. In this study, a concept was developed to facilitate the full integration of digital technologies to enhance future smart and sustainable agricultural systems. The concept has been developed based on the results of a literature review and diverse experiences and expertise which enabled the identification of stat-of-the-art smart technologies, challenges and knowledge gaps. The features of the proposed solution include: data collection methodologies using smart digital tools; platforms for data handling and sharing; application of Artificial Intelligent for data integration and analysis; edge and cloud computing; application of Blockchain, decision support system; and a governance and data security system. The study identified the potential positive implications i.e. the implementation of the concept could increase data value, farm productivity, effectiveness in monitoring of farm operations and decision making, and provide innovative farm business models. The concept could contribute to an overall increase in the competitiveness, sustainability, and resilience of the agricultural sector as well as digital transformation in agriculture and rural areas. This study also provided future research direction in relation to the proposed concept. The results will benefit researchers, practitioners, developers of smart tools, and policy makers supporting the transition to smarter and more sustainable agriculture systems.}

Learning objectives for existing courses were analysed to establish product opportunities. SWOT and Matrix methods were applied to a range of eXtended Reality solutions to establish product fit. Further, project resources were measured to define constraints and opportunities. It was established that competencies that develop basic familiarity, operating and reporting skills are important in the undergraduate curriculum of chemical engineering students, whilst facilitating the development of many of these skills is possible using eXtended Reality solutions. In January 2022, four 360-VR unit operation experiments were fully commissioned for use by students and other stakeholders as part of the courses offered at the pilot-scale plant facilities of DTU.CBE.

Today, Industry 4.0 technologies, such as Big Data analytics and mobile technologies, are forcing firms to seek new ways to create and deliver customer value. We argue that the Android project, one of the most successful open-source digital platforms, reflects a new business model in the age of digital transformation. In the Android community, application developers create and sell applications for the Android operating system provided by the open-source firm (Google), and share the profit with Google. Such an open-source strategy forces the open-source firm to give up the profits from selling the operating system to customers. A firm generally chooses an open-source strategy to increase its user network size. Using the concept of creative intensity, or the speed of idea generation, we offer a new explanation regarding the benefits of an open-source strategy in the age of digital transformation. We investigate how to enhance creative intensity and profit on the open-source digital platform. Our model suggests that an open-source strategy effectively manages the diminishing value of ideas and, thus, facilitates the dynamic capability of an open-source firm.}

A validated digital transformation framework was applied to 346 companies for data collection and subsequent statistical treatment. Almost 60% of the Brazilian MSEs are at primary levels of digital maturity, with 19.1% being unconscious about the digitization process. Digital maturity was shown to be statistically correlated with innovations (p = 0.000) and business revenue (p = 0.009), suggesting that these factors are facilitators in the MSEs digitization. This paper pointed to the urgency of efforts on the part of companies and policy makers in Brazil to implement actions that can foster behaviors, capabilities, and enablers to digital transformation. These findings can allow in-depth discussions and aligned strategies among emerging economies to point out best practices for companies inserted in markets with similar characteristics and challenges.}

Following a survey strategy (n = 244), the study demonstrates that both individual interests and organisational challenges define the shared domain of interest and constitute the motivational factors for joining a VCoP. We identify four roles of engagement: knowledge provider, practitioner, facilitator, and learner, appreciating both self-paced learning and peer interaction facilitated by multiple digital tools. The organisational type as an exemplary characteristic of members correlates with various VCoP elements. An open member structure results in volatile requirements of the VCoP, why we finally discuss agile project management methodology for VCoP delivery.}

These include telemedicine, which extends the boundaries of care and creates new opportunities for relationships between patients and physicians. Despite widespread enthusiasm, at the heart of the process of recognizing these innovations is the patient. Consequently, understanding those variables and acceptance factors that promote good telemedicine practices is crucial. Using a qualitative research approach and relying on multiple case studies, our research demonstrates the role of telemedicine as a vehicle for social impact and translation of medical knowledge. Furthermore, by testing the technology acceptance model with the selected case studies, we find that telemedicine projects should include critical variables such as social influence, facilitating conditions, trust between physicians and patients, privacy, perceived risk technology anxiety, and resistance towards technology. Only by understanding and correctly designing acceptance factors, it will be possible to promote positive telemedicine experiences and obtain the proper cooperation from patients. Although pieces of research aim to have theoretical implications, we like to think that these results are intended for policy-makers, health care managers, medical doctors and nurses who aim to introduce technological advances in health care.}

But it also entails recruiting new employees, as well as re- and upskilling current employees of diverse ages groups for new and increasingly more complex tasks to manage increasingly more complex information. In this article we present an overview and meta perspective on serious games as a human-centric methodology. We discuss how these can contribute to 1) learning how operators react to complex situations and how they deal with incomplete, uncertain, or fuzzy information, 2) understanding how operators of production systems and production networks can be supported by human-centric industrial user interfaces, and 3) enable operators to act appropriately in complex and dynamic cyber-physical production systems. We present an actionable adaptable iterative process model for designing serious games and exemplify this model using a supply chain and quality management serious game. Further, we present empirical studies that illustrate the application of the model and suggest the utility of serious games as a learning environment, to evaluate industrial user interfaces, and to investigate human behavior in complex production environments. As such, we propose serious games as a versatile methodology to facilitate transitioning from Industry 4.0 (data-driven and interconnected) to Industry 5.0 (humane work and sustainability).}

abstract = {In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), rapid development in innovative technologies facilitates the adoption of smart facilities management (FM) in the built environment industry to improve sustainability and digitalization. The Singapore government has realized the enormous potential of smart FM in developing a sustainable city and has implemented several initiatives to promote its adoption. However, the adoption of smart FM in the built environment industry is still in its early stage. Therefore, this study aims to (1) investigate drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM; and (2) explore whether there are significant differences in the perceived importance of the drivers, barriers, and strategies by designations and years of experience. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted to identify 6 drivers, 13 barriers, and 10 strategies. A survey questionnaire was designed and then validated by pilot interviews to collect data from practitioners in the built environment industry. Post-survey interviews were also carried out to validate the analysis results from the questionnaire survey. The study identified that increased energy savings, improved sustainability, and reduced downtime are the three most important drivers. Poor data management, high initial cost, and high cybersecurity risks are the three most important barriers. Development of technology selection mechanisms, improvement of smart FM system, and increased amount of funding are the three most effective strategies to address the challenges. Designations and years of experience have been proved to affect the perceptions of the importance of drivers, barriers, and strategies. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM, offering a starting point for organizations to consider its adoption. This study also enriches the knowledge of smart FM in the built environment industry with the expectations of facilitating the digital transformation and sustainable development of the built environment industry.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics.
OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance.
METHODS
This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world.
SIGNIFICANCE
Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers.}

The transfer of experience-based knowledge in a flexible and self-optimizing production and process planning offers the potential to meet these challenges. Biological systems solve conceptually similar challenges pertaining to the transfer of knowledge, flexibility of individual reactions and adaptation over time. Thus, in the context of digital transformation, mechanisms derived from biology are interpreted and applied to the knowledge domain of production technology. To be able to exploit the potential of bio-inspired production systems, genetic and intelligent properties of technical components and machines were identified and brought together under the concept of “Gentelligence”. Expanding upon this concept with the new idea of process-DNA and biologically inspired optimization algorithms facilitates a more flexible, learning and self-optimizing production, which is shown in three different applications. By using the new concept of gentelligent process planning it is possible to determine machine-specific process parameters in turning processes in order to ensure appropriate roughness within the requirements. Furthermore, the combination of the concept with a material removal simulation allows the determination of the resulting process force in tool grinding for subsequent unknown workpiece geometries. As a result of using the process-DNA, a workpiece-independent knowledge transfer and thus process adaptation for shape error compensation becomes possible. Gentelligent production scheduling enables a process-parallel, holistically optimized machine allocation, and as a result, a significantly reduced lead time.}

We collected data from 198 United Arab Emirate users who had previously used mHealth apps to improve their self-healthcare. The findings suggested that the intention of using this technology is positively influenced by: (1) the levels of performance expectancy and facilitating conditions concerning the use, (2) the level of gamification impact, and (3) the degree of personal innovativeness in the simple design of mHealth apps. These findings extend the theoretical concept of the UTAUT model in mobile healthcare technology. The value of the study lies in constructing an integrated digital transformation model that will assist healthcare companies in comprehending the influence of available resources and lead them to invest significantly in the incumbent digital infrastructure. The findings shall help healthcare practitioners identify critical drivers and key challenges faced by stakeholders concerning mobile health app use in an emerging Arab country that has the vision to improve its healthcare through digital transformation.}

Although process informatics has attracted much attention, physical models are essential to realizing the digital twins. However, building a physical model of an industrial process takes much toil. We aim to facilitate the physical model building by developing an automated physical model building AI, named AutoPMoB, which performs five tasks: 1) retrieving documents about a target process from literature databases, 2) converting the format of each document to HTML format, 3) extracting information required for building a physical model from the documents, such as variables, equations, and experimental data, 4) judging the equivalence of the information extracted from different documents, and 5) reorganizing the information to output a desired physical model. This study focuses on task 4, especially judging the equivalence of variable definitions, i.e., whether two noun phrases represent the same variable. We created a large-scale corpus consisting of papers on chemical engineering, and built ProcessBERT, which is a domain-specific language model pre-trained on the corpus. We proposed a method for judging the equivalence of variable definitions based on ProcessBERT. When judging the equivalence, our proposed method first uses ProcessBERT to obtain the embeddings of the variable definitions. Then, the method calculates the cosine similarity between the embeddings. The method judges that the two definitions are equivalent when the similarity is larger than a threshold. Our proposed method judged the equivalence with higher accuracy than the method based on original BERT and SciBERT.}

In this article, I present a framework intended to assist efforts to address one of the first of these challenges: assessment of organizational AI readiness—that is, an organization’s ability to deploy AI technologies to enable digital transformation, in four key dimensions: technologies, activities, boundaries, and goals. I show that this framework can facilitate analysis both of an organization’s current sociotechnical AI status and of the prospects for the technology’s fuller value-adding, sociotechnical deployment.

In terms of identifying and recommending advertisements, improving the accuracy of advertisement promotion and identification is an urgent need. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are of practical application to facilitate digital transformation in the advertising industry. Among the many AI methods, the network model based on the genetic algorithm back propagation (GABP) neural network is the most compatible with applications in the advertising industry. In this work, the GABP neural network is applied in the construction of social networks to predict the click-through rate (CTR) of website advertising applications through the optimization of advertising promotion strategies. In the processes of optimizing and improving the system model using AI methods, the technological focus is the accuracy of advertising promotion and identification for the developing advertising industry. First, background information on the era of internet and AI development is analyzed. The new media technology is discussed through AI research and traditional advertising industry literature. In addition, a CTR prediction model is created for advertising applications based on the GABP network. In the neural network improvement process, the performance of GABP is enhanced through multiple iterations by optimizing the application strategy of advertising scenarios according to the topology of network connections. The study results demonstrate that different algorithms' recognition accuracy and precision show an increasing trend as the number of model iterations increases. The recognition accuracy of GABP increases from 49 % to 72 %, and the recognition precision of the algorithm increases from 69 % to 86 %. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the GABP network is only 0.6 before the number of neurons increases. When the number of neurons is 400, the AUC value of the algorithm reaches 0.82, and the comprehensive diagnostic value of the system dramatically improves. This research has significant reference value for reforming the traditional advertising work mode, enhancing intellectual development and promoting resource efficiency in the advertising industry.}

The interface of a component is deliberately defined separately from the component’s implementation to define entry points, and at the same time prevent access to the component’s internal resources and logic. Another advantage is that replacing the implementation of one component with another that has a same interface enables continuous consumption because how a component internally meets the requirements of the interface is irrelevant to its consumer. This paper investigates the possibilities to introduce the notion of interface in capability-oriented IS engineering. Capability Driven Development (CDD) is an example of a methodological approach for configuring dynamic, context aware, re-deployable business capabilities on top of existing enterprise information systems to enable continuous delivery of business for varying situational contexts. CDD relies on capability as the central component that integrates other elements of organizational design such as goals, KPIs, context information, processes, resources, and software services. These elements produce and use lot of different data, internal as well as external. In order to facilitate the uptake and use of capabilities, most of the necessary data should be made available for the use by the consumers of the capability. In this study, we provide an initial view on how the data interface of the capability component should be defined. The proposal is illustrated on the service concerning a regional roads maintenance.}

Digital technology (DT) is considered to be a crucial enabler of a PSS that facilitates CE integration in businesses. While discussions concerning the capacity of DT to overcome the main challenges posed by CE are growing, the specific evolution path of a PSS that can evolve to the level required by a CE and for the development of DT for each PSS type have not been widely explored. This paper reviewed a multiple-case study involving three manufacturing firms that each used PSS in business evolution projects and proposes guiding principles that can be used to support an effective approach to using the PSS to facilitate a CE at the business evolution stage. Moreover, in this systematic approach, DT impacts PSS deployment by acting as an enabler. The results contribute to theory by advancing the discussion exploring the potential relation between business evolution and circular principles through the mapping of PSS types. Explicit knowledge of the design principles behind PSS approaches can be obtained by analyzing this relationship. In addition, precise DT adaptation has been found in this study to be able to integrate toolsets that satisfy a variety of product demands and productivity plans by using specific technology to develop iterations for increasing service quality. From a practical perspective, this paper can help practitioners navigate the evolution of their businesses through the PSS model to enable a CE that is based on their existing digital and business capabilities.}

We then develop a preliminary theoretical model based on the interview findings and conduct a survey to test our research model. The empirical results suggest that three platform mechanisms, namely member credibility, blockchain certificate, and structural assurance, significantly facilitate the three trust targets, which subsequently enhance individuals' behavioral intentions. A mediation analysis further demonstrates that the three trust targets partially or fully mediate the influences of three platform mechanisms on behavioral intentions through different path relationships. Our study contributes to the extant literature by uncovering the nomological network among three specific trust targets and explicating their antecedents as well as behavioral outcomes in the emerging context of blockchain-enabled applications.}

New management approaches, flexibility of operations as well as product- and service-related innovativeness determines SMEs survival and development. As service SMEs start to compete more openly, rather than locally, their owners and managers have to stay alert and ready for changes. As digitization is beginning the factor which strongly influence how innovation processes are or can be implemented, also service SMEs should be actively aware of how digital transformation affects their environment. Emerging digital tools that aim to support the innovation process also influence its possible modifications, bringing a number of possible benefits and optimisations.

Furthermore, the combination of the concept with a material removal simulation allows the determination of the resulting process force in tool grinding for subsequent unknown workpiece geometries. As a result of using the process-DNA, a workpiece-independent knowledge transfer and thus process adaptation for shape error compensation becomes possible. Gentelligent production scheduling enables a process-parallel, holistically optimized machine allocation, and as a result, a significantly reduced lead time.}

Our systematic literature review identifies key trends in advanced maintenance techniques and the consolidation of traditional maintenance concepts, which are driven by the increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the need to optimize manufacturing systems' performance and reliability. In light of our findings, we highlight the importance of addressing sustainability factors, human aspects, and the implementation of environmental KPIs in future research. Building upon these insights, we introduce the Maintenance 5.0 framework, which emphasizes the integration of human-centered and AI-driven strategies for achieving efficient and sustainable maintenance in Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) systems. We propose a novel framework that links traditional and advanced maintenance policies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in the maintenance field. This work underscores the need for future research to bridge the gap between these policies, enabling a seamless transition for SMEs towards Industry 4.0 maintenance practices, while fostering sustainable and socially responsible operations.}

It also facilitates work and improves work outcomes in care systems. Currently, in European Union member states, many older adults seek acceptance to nursing homes too early. Current capacities of available nursing homes are in several member states insufficient to cater to increasing demand from the ageing population. How to prolong living in the community and postpone the reallocation to the nursing home is a major challenge in the European ageing society. According to the Web of Science, in the last 20 years, there has been growing research interest in ambient assisted living. Until now, the field of nursing and the field of social care in many member states are not integrated sufficiently, resulting in increased expenditures for nursing and social care on one hand and lack of services provided for a growing number of older adults with declining functional capabilities on the other hand. This paper aims to review the literature on the ambient assisted living and introduce the multiple decrement model for the measurement of efficiency of developed ambient assisted living technologies that are incorporated into the systems for management and control of long-term care services. Based on the proposed model, the future research agenda is outlined.}

Through a systematic literature review, a holistic business model framework is developed, which is then used to analyse the empirical evidence from the creative industries. The research found that digital technologies have facilitated pervasive changes in business models, and some significant trends have emerged. However, the reconfigured business models are often not ‘new’ in the unprecedented sense. Business model innovations are primarily reflected in using digital technologies to enable the deployment of a wider range of business models than previously available to a firm. A significant emerging trend is the increasing adoption of multiple business models as a portfolio within one firm. This is happening in firms of all sizes, when one firm uses multiple business models to serve different markets segments, sell different products, or engage with multi-sided markets, or to use different business models over time. The holistic business model framework is refined and extended through a recursive learning process, which can serve both as a cognitive instrument for understanding business models and a planning tool for business model innovations. The paper contributes to our understanding of the theory of business models and how digital technologies facilitate business model innovations in the creative industries. Three new themes for future research are highlighted.}

Many consumers are adopting and using AI-based apps, devices, and services in their everyday lives. However, research examining consumer behavior in using AI apps is scant. We examine critical factors in AI app adoption by extending and validating a well-established unified theory of adoption and use of technology, UTAUT2. We also explore the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in consumers’ behavior, including potentially relevant segments of AI app adopters. To augment the knowledge of end users’ engagement and relevant segments, we have added two new antecedent variables into UTAUT2: technology fear and consumer trust. Prediction-orientated segmentation was used on 740 valid responses collected using a pre-tested survey instrument. The results show five segments with different behaviors that were influenced by the variables of the proposed model. Once known, the profiles were used to propose apps to AI developers to improve consumer engagement. The moderating effects of the added variables—technology fear and consumer trust—are also shown. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings and propose priorities for future research.}

The results show that IoT and Big Data are predominantly reengineering factors for business processes, products and services; however, a lack of widespread knowledge and adoption has led research to evolve into multiple, yet inconsistent paths. The study offers interesting implications for managers and marketers, highlighting how the digital transformation enabled by IoT and Big Data can positively impact many facets of business. By treating IoT and Big Data as faces of the same coin, this study also sheds light on current challenges and opportunities, with the hope of informing future research and practice.}

The paper aims to explore the underpinning mechanisms of a Higher Education Institution in managing digital transformation and capitalizing upon the benefits of digital technologies amidst extreme uncertainty. We engage in a qualitative, in-depth case study of a UK-based Higher Education Institution to empirically explore the combination of digital technologies and transfiguration of its organizational dimensions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight three mechanisms: fostering technologies to stay afloat, scaling functionalities to create new value, and justifying value to design change. Our contribution is threefold. First, we capture the conjugation of digital technologies and transfiguration of business processes, strategy, and culture in a paradigmatic case of digital transformation. Second, we articulate the mechanisms through which our case organization managed such transformation.

Accordingly, this study explores the Data Science Roadmapping (DSR) to guide organizations in aligning their business strategies with data-related, technological, and organizational resources. The proposed approach is built on the widely adopted technology roadmapping framework and customizes its context, architecture, and process by synthesizing data science, big data, and data-driven organization literature. Based on industry collaborations, the framework provides a hybrid and agile methodology comprising the recommended steps. We applied DSR with a research group with sector experience to create a comprehensive data science roadmap to validate and refine the framework. The results indicate that the framework facilitates DSR initiatives by creating a comprehensive roadmap capturing strategy, data, technology, and organizational perspectives. The contemporary literature illustrates prebuilt roadmaps to help businesses become data-driven. However, becoming data-driven also necessitates significant social change toward openness and trust. The DSR initiative can facilitate this social change by opening communication channels, aligning perspectives, and generating consensus among stakeholders.}

This work adopts a resource-based view (RBV) to explore the potential role that digital technologies play in the cultivation of a manufacturing firm's competitive advantage, and the deployment of existing internal resources and core competencies to achieve net-zero manufacturing emissions and CE. Two questions are addressed: (1) What competitive advantage(s) may be derived from the integration of digital technologies to achieve net-zero manufacturing emissions, and (2) does adopting an RBV facilitate the development of meaningful (and novel) competitive advantage? Engaged scholarship is used to analyse and apply theory to an empirical, real-world dataset documenting the perspectives and experiences of 13 manufacturing firms. Applying the VRIO framework, 21 identified digital technology-based core competencies are categorised as forms of competitive advantage that may be possible for manufacturing firms pursuing net-zero emissions. Four scenarios of digital technology adoption pathways are proposed, differentiated by the degree of radical vs. incremental interests and options available to the firm. This study highlights the critical need for firms to incorporate intangible asset management and development, including the labour and supply chain relationships, as part of their digital transformation strategies. Further, we demonstrate the potential of RBV as a lens for evaluating the competitive advantage potential of corporate sustainability initiatives, and facilitating the development of related strategies.}

GS countries are trying to leverage their growing demand for innovative products and services to negotiate the uptake of novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).

However, a misaligned AI-adoption strategy entails the risk of alienating the social, economic, and even cultural requirements of such countries, ultimately leading to the incorporation of technologies not serving the needs of their users. Subsequently, we conduct a study whose goal is to provide guidelines on how to perform a comprehensive analysis of the AI ecosystems in GS countries, to determine their readiness to adopt and utilize beneficially these technologies. For this, we performed a qualitative case study of two GS countries, namely Senegal and Cambodia. The depiction of their AI ecosystems unveiled the need to stimulate their societies (i.e., by media exposure, education, etc.) in discerning the practical effects of AI. However, an impactful AI implementation requires a reciprocated satisfaction of the needs of multiple contributing actors. Finally, particular recommendations are offered at the level of these countries’ academic, industrial, and governmental constitutions, suggesting to focalize their resources in order to better energize (and optimally disperse) their research and entrepreneurial capabilities that could help identify the ways in which AI solutions can be of added-value within the premises of these two countries.}

A survey was administered to patients who had used a teleconsultation platform during the pandemic period. As one of the largest studies to date, a sample of 1233 respondents was collected and analyzed using a partial least squares approach, often mobilized in the information systems (IS) domain. Furthermore, a deep analysis using all recommended metrics was performed. The results highlight the significance of trusting beliefs, and self-efficacy in the adoption of digital healthcare services.

Faced with increasing difficulties in financing transport infrastructure, many countries are seeking to allocate their resources in such a way as to maximize net returns. In order to facilitate such distribution, it is necessary to fully understand all the large–scale consequences of infrastructure investments. Transport infrastructure can be defined as a factor that guarantees growth and economic development, thanks to the functions of crossing space in terms of the movement of people and the exchange of goods. The effect of the impact of transport infrastructure on the economy largely depends on how society uses the services offered by infrastructure facilities (Mottaeva & Nechaeva, 2021). Infrastructure, as a factor that activates socio–economic progress, is also one of the important factors determining the living conditions of the population. It is widely believed that improper planning and implementation of an infrastructure project can have a negative impact on the economy and environment of the region. In some cases, infrastructure investments may pose a threat to communities that will be directly affected by this project.}

abstract = {Digital Transformation (DT) is increasingly vital for healthcare organisations. It is yielding new ways to address quality of care, medical practice, management and, generally, value creation for all the various actors of a healthcare ecosystem. However, implementing DT in healthcare is not straightforward. It requires simultaneously considering technological, political, social, cultural and economic aspects in innovating and delivering services. Moreover, it entails listening to and involving the heterogeneous set of actors in the healthcare ecosystem, in line with user-driven and open innovation logic. Recently Innovation Labs have been acknowledged as an initiative to facilitate innovation, supporting users, customers, and organisations in tackling and providing solutions to business changes and DT challenges. However, there is still a lack of understanding to what extent Innovation Labs can support the digital transformation of healthcare organisations. Through an in-depth case study of a Health Innovation Lab, this paper sheds more light on the role of Innovation Labs and their management as catalysers of innovation and DT in healthcare settings. The research contributes to defining and enhancing the understanding of the structure, functioning and management of Innovation Labs in healthcare organisations. Thus, it explores the potential of Innovation Labs in healthcare settings. From a practical perspective, the study provides suggestions and guidelines for managing healthcare Innovation Labs. It identifies common pitfalls to avoid, as well as best practices and tools to foster DT.}

Although these sectors rely heavily on product customization and short manufacturing cycles, they are still not able to take full advantage of the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 surfaced to address the current challenges of shorter product life-cycles, highly customized products and stiff global competition. The new manufacturing paradigm supports the development of modular factory structures within a computerized Internet of Things environment. With Industry 4.0, rigid planning and production processes can be revolutionized. However, the computerization of manufacturing has a high degree of complexity and its implementation tends to be expensive, which goes against the reality of SMEs that power the traditional sectors. This paper reviews the main scientific-technological advances that have been developed in recent years in traditional sectors with the aim of facilitating the transition to the new industry standard.}

A model is proposed to determine which aspects of principal leadership influence EDR use, and factor analysis is conducted with all the items included in the model. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) variance analysis is then used to perform a factor analysis of the resulting dimensions. The model is tested with a sample of 142 Spanish school principals. The results show that how useful school principals perceive EDRs to be is the most influential variable in the digital transformation of schools. Other key factors include school contextual variables, the technical support and service related to the EDRs, and the principal's professional and personal profile. Educational policies for digital transformation should thus integrate principals into their core definition, considering factors such as their age or teaching and leadership experience. They should also consider contextual factors, such as school size and complexity and the school's digital culture. School principals' leadership can facilitate a digital culture transformation, not through their authority or bureaucratic influence, but rather their capacity to foster an open debate that allows educational communities to see the integration of EDRs into pedagogical models as an opportunity to improve outcomes.}

Due to this network connectivity between people, organizations, resources and entire industries, value and economic growth can be generated within the interactive ecosystem of digital platforms. The special feature of this business model is that competitive advantages, contrary to dominant paradigms, do not primarily rely on the physical infrastructure or the control over scarce and valuable resources. Despite the high practical relevance, little systematic knowledge exists on why platform-based business models often outperform traditional pipeline businesses in many respects. We contribute to this research gap by exploring the critical success factors of platform business models. Based on a qualitative analysis on digital platforms in the metal and steel industry, we identify six key success factors of platform-based business models: We relate these success factors to the design of the three dimensions of business models as described in the literature: (1) value creation, (2) value delivery, and (3) value capture dimensions. Furthermore, our analysis could extend these and design features of the business model by three additional success factors (4) the promotion and sensitization of digital transformation, (5) a suitable platform architecture and strategic judgement of platform providers, as well as (6) the promotion of a start-up culture as central success factors.}

Digital transformation in the banking sector is a continuous process that affects both the external and internal environment by redesigning internal processes and existing methods. There are many reasons that digital transformation takes place, such as servicing remote areas without physical branches, differentiation from competitors or reduction of operating costs. In any case, there are a lot of doubts about the acceptance of digital technologies. Thus, this article examines the acceptance rate of digital transformation in the banking sector in Greece. One hundred and sixty-one employees at Greek banks completed the survey. A Multivariate Regression Analysis was implemented to analyze the items of the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings of this paper indicate the perception of bank employees with regard to new technologies. This paper provides a practical contribution for executives of Greek banking organizations to schedule targeted educational programs to facilitate the transition to the new digital era for their employees. Executives are curious if employees are ready to accept and implement digitalization in their daily job routine. Therefore, the Technology Acceptance Model can provide answers to executives in facing these challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Currently, health care is expert-centric, especially with regard to decision-making. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) or interconnected electronic health records (EHRs) suffer from low adoption rates. In the rare cases of technically successful implementation, they often result in inefficient or error-prone processes.
Aim & Methods
This paper explores the state of the art in AI-based digital decision support systems (DDSSs). To overcome the low adoption rates, we propose a systematic strategy for bringing DDSS research into clinical practice based on a design science approach. DDSSs can transform health care to be more innovative, patient-centric, accurate and efficient. We contribute by providing a framework for the successful development, evaluation and analysis of systems for AI-based decision-making. This framework is then evaluated using focus group interviews.
Results
Centred around our framework, we define a systematic approach for the use of AI in health care. Our systematic AI support approach highlights essential perspectives on DDSSs for systematic development and analysis. The aim is to develop and promote robust and optimal practices for clinical investigation and evaluation of DDSS in order to encourage their adoption rates. The framework contains the following dimensions: disease, data, technology, user groups, validation, decision and maturity.
Conclusion
DDSSs focusing on only one framework dimension are generally not successful; therefore, we propose to consider each framework dimension during analysis, design, implementation and evaluation so as to raise the number of DDSSs used in clinical practice.
Public Interest Summary
The digital transformation of the healthcare sector creates the potential for the sector to be more accurate, efficient and patient-centric using AI, or so-called digital decision support systems. In this research, we explore why these systems are needed and how they can be successfully implemented in clinical practice. For this, we propose a systematic approach based on our conceptual framework. Against this background, we present our vision for further advancing these technologies. We see our systematic AI support as a primary driver, with the possibility to facilitate the much-needed breakthrough of decision support systems in health care.}

Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer’s buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.}

The C♭-model is a theoretical framework that systematizes contextual factors, which influence students‘ learning activities as the most important facilitator of students’ learning success. Using a self-assessment instrument with anchored scenarios in a sample of 1625 higher education teachers, we were able to identify three levels at which higher education teachers initiated digital learning activities: a low level (powerpointers), a moderate level (clickerers), and a high level (digital pros). The findings also support the relevance of the contextual factors specified in the C♭-model for initiating a high level of digital learning activities, namely digitalization policy and commitment of university administration, institutional equipment, technical and educational support, self-assessed basic digital skills, and self-assessed technology-related teaching skills. All of these factors explain a substantial amount of variance in the level of initiated digital learning activities. We conclude that a comprehensive approach rather than isolated measures might contribute to successful teaching and learning in higher education.}

Owing to the lack of research in emerging Asian nations, this research aimed to unearth the determinants of blockchain acceptance for supply chain financing by a Bangladeshi financing company called IPDC. Centred on a technology acceptance framework called UTAUT (unified theory of acceptance and use of technology) and open innovation research, an expanded model with a mediating variable is developed for this study. This research work employs the deductive inference method in conjunction with the positivism paradigm. A structural questionnaire was used to gather data, which were then processed through Smart-PLS (partial least square) for SEM (structural equation modeling). The survey includes all the people who are directly or indirectly involved in the supply chain financing platform of IPDC. The study consists of seven direct hypotheses and one mediating hypothesis. The results show that all the direct hypotheses except the impact of social influence on the behavioural intention to use (BINTU) blockchain are significant. The mediating hypothesis indicating the role of BINTU in the relationship between facilitating conditions (FCON) and the actual use of blockchain is also supported. FCON and BINTU together explain 88.7% variation in blockchain use behaviour for supply chain financing. The research advances past findings by employing an expanded UTAUT framework and validating observations with the other relevant studies throughout the world.}

It greatly facilitates the digitalization of user data, environment conditions, and interaction process, which makes digital transformation (DT) feasible in smart home context to help create innovative life services and additional user values. Cross-device interaction has thusly become an important measure in realizing DT in smart home areas, and related studies are growing rapidly. Unlike previous reviews, which mainly focus on the historical development, the applications and evaluation strategies of cross-device interaction, a user-centric perspective was proposed in this work to emphasize the user experience and user values. For the purpose, a systematic literature review approach was developed, and 130 articles in recent 15 years were obtained and reviewed. Through text mining and bibliometric analysis, the topics attracting higher research attention were identified. Following the identified research spots, the related works were analyzed from the aspects of (i) main services supported by cross-device interaction, (ii) common interaction configurations for different service purposes, and (iii) user-perceived values brought by cross-device interaction. Moreover, the challenges which hinder the deepened digitalization of smart home systems were discussed, including data quality, user experience and system safety issues. Accordingly, future development opportunities in the further integration of emerging digital technologies, attempts in natural interaction, and extension of smart home scenarios were suggested. This review is expected to help researchers better understand the role of cross-device interaction in digitalizing a complex smart home system, provide references on effective configuration of interaction systems for different purposes, and shed light on future development directions in this area.}

The C♭-model aims at systematizing research on digital teaching and learning and offers a roadmap for future research to understand the complex dynamic of factors that lead to successful digital teaching and learning in higher education via suitable learning activities. First, we introduce students' learning outcomes as central benchmarks of teaching and learning with digital technologies in higher education. Second, we want to focus on a major proximal factor for students' learning outcomes and thus apply a learning activities perspective. Learning activities involving digital technologies reflect cognitive processes of students when using digital technologies and are causally connected with students' learning outcomes. Third, we highlight several contextual facilitators for learning activities involving technology in the C♭-model: learning opportunities that result from higher education teachers' instructional use of technology and students' self-arranged learning opportunities involving digital technologies. Apart from these proximal facilitators, we include more distal factors, namely, higher education teachers' knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward digital technology; higher education teachers' qualification; students' and teachers’ digital technology equipment; and institutional, organizational, and administrative factors.}

abstract = {Recently, the NMBP-35 Horizon 2020 projects - NanoMECommons, CHARISMA, and Easi-stress - organised a collaborative workshop to increase awareness of their contributions to the industry "commons" in terms of characterisation and digital transformation. They have established interoperability standards for knowledge management in characterisation and introduced new solutions for materials testing, aided by the standardisation of faster and more accurate assessment methods. The lessons learned from these projects and the discussions during the joint workshop emphasised the impact of recent developments and emerging needs in the field of characterisation. Specifically, the focus was on enhancing data quality through harmonisation and standardisation, as well as making advanced technologies and instruments accessible to a broader community with the goal of fostering increased trust in new products and a more skilled society. Experts also highlighted how characterisation and the corresponding experimental data can drive future innovation agendas towards technological breakthroughs. The focus of the discussion revolved around the characterisation and standardisation processes, along with the collection of modelling and characterisation tools, as well as protocols for data exchange. The broader context of materials characterisation and modelling within the materials community was explored, drawing insights from the Materials 2030 Roadmap and the experiences gained from NMBP-35 projects. This whitepaper has the objective of addressing common challenges encountered by the materials community, illuminating emerging trends and evolving techniques, and presenting the industry's perspective on emerging requirements and past success stories. It accomplishes this by providing specific examples and highlighting how these experiences can create fresh opportunities and strategies for newcomers entering the market. These advancements are anticipated to facilitate a more efficient transition from Industry 4.0 to 5.0 during the industrial revolution.}

abstract = {Background: Mobile phone users have increased exponentially in the past decade. Present-day mobile phones can serve several functions with the help of applications, also known as apps. There is limited research on mobile application usage for healthcare delivery and health promotion. Purpose: This study evaluates the users’ perception of individuals using m-health apps to identify the reasons for using m-health apps, barriers preventing m-health adoption, and the type of rewards provided by application developers to encourage users. Additionally, this study tests the hypothesis model to assess the effects of social media influence, performance expectancy, and price on behavioral intentions to adopt m-health apps. Methodology: The study is descriptive and cross-sectional. Responses are collected from 192 m-health users selected with the help of a purposive sampling technique. Descriptive and frequency analysis was done with the help of Microsoft Excel 2016. Path analysis and hypothesis testing were done with the help of IBM SPSS V. 25 and Hayes Process Macro 3.5. Results: Primary reasons for using m-health apps included intentions to improve fitness (70.5%), followed by yoga and meditation (25.9%) and teleconsultation (23.2%). The top two barriers hindering the adoption of the m-health app were accuracy concerns (34%) and cost (21%). The variables influencing m-health selection decision include app reviews (40.5%) and ratings (28.8%). It was found that price dampens the relationship between social media influence and performance expectancy with β=−0.25, LLCI=−0.48, ULCI=−0.013, P=0.03. Practical Implications: M-health app developers and sellers should focus on improving the accuracy of the m-health apps in tracking fitness-related indicators; similarly, to increase the number of users, m-health developers should keep the prices reasonably low to enable interested users get m-health app user experience, scoring high on social media influence and having high-performance expectations. Additionally, m-health app developers should encourage satisfied users to give positive reviews and higher ratings at all sales points. Conclusions: M-health users primarily expect fitness improvement and facilitation in yoga and meditation with calorie monitoring from m-health usage. Social media influence and performance expectancy significantly affect behavioral intentions to use m-health apps. M-health app developers need to keep the prices reasonably low.}

The battle that was fought by institutions and their faculty members to move classes and programs from a face-to-face environment to an online one has resulted in a new set of challenges for them to overcome. In the context of online education, academics working in less developed countries are confronted with quite different realities than their peers working in more developed economies. This article investigates the effect that COVID-19 had on the higher education systems of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, three of the most important SAARC nations at a time when these countries were struggling with limited resources, unreliable infrastructure, and a pronounced “digital divide” in higher education. The literature review and in-depth interviews conducted for the purpose of this study uncovered six primary challenges. These challenges were identified as facilitating conditions, technology readiness, learning experience, mental health, concerns regarding performance improvement and sustainability. The findings presented here highlight the necessity for more government intervention and investment in order to: firstly, improve the quality of teaching and learning; and secondly, close the digital divide. Several recommendations are stated in this paper for future research to consider.}

The implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), a technology that allows replicating human actions in existing systems, given its benefits, can play an important role in achieving this goal, often referred as the digital transformation of organizations. However, the benefits of RPA implementation may not be perceived equally by managers, those responsible or that required its implementation, and lower-level employees. The work described in this paper aims not only to assess the perception that both groups have of the impacts of technology, but also to understand whether the use of robots by the employees of a shared services company positively influences their perception of the technology and whether it affects developments in additional robots in the future. A questionnaire, underpinned in a multidimensional evaluation model of the technology and given to all the company's employees, is used as the main research instrument, while results are analysed and interpreted using descriptive statistical techniques and hypothesis testing. We argue that this study may be an important contribution to the company for a better understanding of its employees' perception of RPA, allowing the tailoring of its future communication strategies to facilitate the acceptance of the technology and, thus, enhance the success and effectiveness of its implementation. Furthermore, the multidimensional evaluation model developed enhances the existing literature on the topic of RPA impacts, more specifically in terms of evaluating possible differences in perceptions between managers and other employees.}

Nevertheless, misalignment among digital initiative and existing operational routines are found in some companies, making the effectiveness of process digitalization initiative (PDI) uncertain. This research empirically investigates the effect of PDI on firm performance. Taking the perspective of dynamic operational capability, this study considers three key organizational factors, i.e., differentiation strategy, absorptive capability and lean production mechanism, that can facilitate firms to align their existing operational processes with digital technology and examine how they affect the implementation of PDI. We employ the long-horizon event study approach using the panel data collected from 168 firms adopting PDI in China during the period between 2006 and 2018. The findings of this study demonstrate that PDI implementation enhances firm performance. The results also show that differentiation strategy and absorptive capacity can enhance the effect of PDI implementation, but lean production has a substitution role in the effect of PDI. This research contributes to the literature on digital transformation and dynamic capability by investigating the actual effects of PDI implementation and exploring the key elements for its success from a novel perspective (i.e., dynamic capability development). This research also provides practical guidelines to enterprises how to conduct effective process digitalization and valuable insights to governments how to support enterprises for digitalization.}

abstract = {The current planetary crisis and the perceived urgency necessitates more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Businesses, particularly the multinationals, play a key role in transitioning to a circular economy, which provides a promising approach to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Industry 4.0 technologies can theoretically support this transition and enable circular economy through, for example, data-driven and smart business processes. However, merging these new technologies with a circular economy is not a straightforward and well-established process and it fundamentally changes the business value chain. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic overview to help better understand the transition process to circular business models and the enabling role of industry 4.0. Merging these concepts underlines that many factors are interrelated and should be investigated in a holistic way instead of siloes. The findings imply that changes transcend business boundaries, including new value chain characteristics and operation models and indicate the interconnected nature of certain factors along the product lifecycle, including service-based models, circular design, reverse flows, consumers and users, and collaborations. This paper proposes a conceptual transition framework to address how new circular business models can integrate digitally adaptive transformations and proposals for future research are reflected upon.}

Building on organizational adaptation theory and institutional theory, this study examines the impact of digital technology usage on business model innovation, the mediating role of strategic flexibility, and the moderating role of the institutional environment, including policy support and regulatory turbulence. The results based on a sample of 236 traditional manufacturing firms show that there is a significant association between digital technology usage and business model innovation in which strategic flexibility plays a mediating role. The institutional environment has a dual role in this association: policy support strengthens the impact of digital technology usage on strategic flexibility, but regulatory turbulence weakens it. The findings enrich the existing research on the mechanisms and boundary conditions of digitally driven business model innovation and support manufacturing business model innovation in the digital context.}

However, extensive use of organizational ICTs presents the potential for employee monitoring, control, and surveillance, which could be viewed adversely by employees leading to negative outcomes. Motivated by this dilemma about the mixed influence of organizational ICTs on employee outcomes, we first draw upon the literature on spatial intrusion to identify the two dimensions of employee technological spatial intrusion (TSI) — employee accessibility and employee visibility. Next, taking a locus of causality perspective, we examine the mechanisms through which the two dimensions of TSI impact ICT enabled employee innovation. Our research suggests that TSI may advance or inhibit employee innovation depending on the interactional meaning that the employees attach to the experienced intrusions. We test the proposed research model via a survey of 163 employees from diverse organizations who regularly use ICTs for their work. Results indicate that employee accessibility generally has positive, while employee visibility has negative relationships with employee innovation. Further, we demonstrate that ‘ICT usefulness perceptions’ mediate the relationships between accessibility and ICT-enabled innovation. Our research is among the first to conceptualize TSI and theorize its impact on employee innovation. Demonstrating the positive and negative influence of TSI may help organizations to design technologies that are perceived as more useful by employees. Together, the results from our study have implications for undertaking technological assessments for facilitating employee innovation.}

We draw on the organizational sense making literature to identify the organizational enablers of circular supply chains and their relationships with the environmental performance of supply chains. Data was collected from various supply chains within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was adopted to test the hypothesis derived from a systematic review of the literature. Originality of this work stems from the conceptualisation and validation of a framework for circular supply chains and sustainable performance as a combination of process facilitators and a persuasive organizational narrative that enables organizations to embrace the circular economy practices. The validated framework has implications for both academia and the industry because of its emphasis on the joint effects of a) the discursive ability of organizational actors to articulate a paradigm shift towards circular supply chains b) the process facilitators comprising of actions and practices that enable circular supply chains.}

abstract = {Over the past years, Malang (Indonesia) has encountered environmental problems due to municipal solid waste (MSW) overgeneration. Nevertheless, the increasing volume and complexity of MSW management in the city could be tackled using digital solutions. As a key location of ICT development, China is a key partner for Indonesia to improve its MSW management using digital technologies. As a miniature of China's sustainable waste management, Nanning represents a model of smart city that applies resource recovery paradigms using digitalization. Using a case-study approach, this work critically investigates how to strengthen waste recycling industry in Malang using digitalization-based circular economy (CE) according to Nanning's experiences in digitalizing waste recycling. It was found that lessons learnt from Nanning in MSW management were transferable and applicable for Malang to replicate its model, while paving the way forward for a transition towards a CE in waste sector. Traditionally, waste segregation at source was not properly conducted in Malang due to lack of environmental awareness and less public participation, while the waste management in Nanning is time-efficient and cost-effective. Nanning's experiences in digitalizing recyclable materials and/or recycled goods could facilitate Malang to shift towards a digitalization-based CE. Integrating automatic segregation and digitalization at waste banks is efficient in terms of time. With digitalization, over 90% of the solid waste in Malang is segregated properly, while diverting 60% of its non-biodegradable trash from landfills. Overall, the use of digital technologies has enabled waste banks to revolutionize waste industry, while promoting sustainable development at local level. To contribute their share to the UN SDGs, other cities in Indonesia are at their transition towards a digitalization-based CE. There is still a long way for them to attain full circularity and reap the benefits of digital transformation in the waste sector. Hence, it is necessary for stakeholders to promulgate effective policies and strengthen CE implementation on non-biodegradable waste through digital technologies.}

Expectations regarding the opportunities that Industry 4.0 offers for sustainable manufacturing are significantly high, but the lack of accurate understanding of the process through which Industry 4.0 technologies enable sustainable manufacturing is a fundamental barrier for businesses pursuing digitalization and sustainable thinking. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a roadmap that explains how Industry 4.0 and the underlying digital technologies can be leveraged to support and facilitate the triple bottom line of sustainable manufacturing. To this purpose, the study conducted a systematic literature review and identified 15 sustainability functions through which Industry 4.0 contributes to sustainable manufacturing. Interpretive structural modeling was further applied to identify the relationships that may exist within the sustainability functions. The resulting sustainable manufacturing roadmap explains how, and in which order, various Industry 4.0 sustainability functions contribute to developing the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. The resulting implications are expected to serve manufacturers, industrialists, and academia as a strategic guide for leveraging Industry 4.0 digital transformation to support sustainable development.}

Additionally, they have the potential to become the foundation of sustainable economic growth if given the right tools and support. In order to stay competitive, SMEs have to adapt permanently both in products and production. Approaches related to the vision of Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) and Smart Factories can help SMEs to address these challenges. The use cases, implementation examples and recommendations of the “Plattform Industrie 4.0” provide a basis for these approaches. However, the success of these approaches will depend on whether or not SMEs will adopt and implement them. Nevertheless, the barriers for adopting I4.0 approaches and technologies are still high. Specialized research institutions in Germany – so-called I4.0 test environments – have a broad infrastructure for developing and testing I4.0-relevant technologies, such as production machines and equipment or ICT testing facilities. This paper introduces an approach to facilitate the collaboration between SMEs and I4.0 test environments for creating new smart products enabled by I4.0 technologies. The overarching aim is enhancing business growth for manufacturing SMEs. Key aspects of this approach are: a) A competence-based matching mechanism implemented in an online platform, b) A funding scheme provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and c) Initiating, planning, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for funded SME projects. This approach will allow the rapid and targeted development of innovative Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and innovative smart products. In addition, this approach enables the cooperation between various I4.0 test environments and the continuous improvement of their offerings to manufacturing SMEs.}

COVID-19 impacted social-distancing measures forced an abrupt switch to online learning in most universities, putting immense pressure on the students to creatively adapt to new ways of online learning. Despite the purported positives of online learning, in the COVID-19 scenario, students reported mixed outcomes. While some students could adapt to the ‘new normal’, others struggled to adjust to the transformed IT-enabled learning scenario. Grounding our work in IT mindfulness literature, we posit that an IT-enabled learning environment may have differential impact on students’ productivity- and creativity-in-learning, depending on the extent of their IT mindfulness. Besides leveraging the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, we hypothesize the mediating role of techno eustress in the relationship between student IT mindfulness and learning effectiveness. We test the theorized model through data collected via a two-wave survey in a university student population exclusively using IT-enabled learning environments during the pandemic lockdown period. Results indicate that IT mindfulness has significant positive relationships with both productivity- and creativity-in- learning. Moreover, these relationships are mediated by the students’ techno eustress perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications arising from our study are also discussed.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determining factors of the high levels of NEETs both in EU member states and in partner countries, to support policy steering and increase socio-economic cohesion. The use of longitudinal data (2005–2020) from Eurostat and World Bank databases and selected and the testing of a number of 19 factors likely to influence the rate of NEETs show us that the effectiveness of public policy solutions focused on this category of population increases when complex factors and not singular elements are targeted. From a methodological point of view, we will use MARS models and fixed effects panel models. To account for countries’ heterogeneity, these models are applied to homogeneous groups of countries, identified through cluster analysis. Social cohesion and sustainability measures for policy steering have higher chances if the action of the responsible institutions targets both meso and macro levels, if it acts not only on a factor but also on the causes that favor its manifestation. Our analysis demonstrated that the measures aimed at increasing the chances of NEETs in order to facilitate their access to education, the labor market, and social inclusion must be coordinated with those of support for combating poverty and any type of exclusion, the support given to employers (subsidizing jobs, for example), the family and the community to which the young person belongs or local authorities. Also, the research results show us that there are more common elements between countries when we analyze the factors likely to increase the rate of NEETs than when we focus on their analysis by geographical criteria, based on EU membership status or EU partner status, etc.}

abstract = {The concept of the 4th industrial revolution is becoming a strategic determinant of sustainability, success and competitiveness in the modern mining sector. The importance of digital transformation in the mining industry has long been debated, hampered in part by the conservative nature of the mining sector. Much of the debate has focused on choosing suitable mining techniques that provide acceptable levels of ore/waste selectivity, the scale of implementation, cost reduction and suitable metallurgical extraction techniques. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the digital transformation of the minerals and extractive industry with a focus towards energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. We address: (a) geological elements that influence the level of selectivity during mining, and technologies that deal with waste rejection; (b) eco-friendly techniques, such as tunnel-boring machines, or the use of non-explosive techniques that can assist fragmentation of ores, thereby decreasing energy requirements during mineral processing and improving mineral recovery; (c) use of low-water-consumption automated ore-waste sorting systems; (d) selective metal leaching using coarse particle percolation as an alternate method for treating complicated low-grade ores; and (e) assessing new technological boundaries for the mineral sector. A combination of these aforementioned processes will significantly reduce mining waste. Orebody features, mining methods and equipment, desired scales of implementation, alignment with circular strategies, ore extraction efficiency, and socio-economic factors all play a role in the development and implementation of new technologies and techniques.}

Traffic monitoring and control at major airports is facilitated by the Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS).

This paper provides statistics for airport accidents caused by overland traffic safety violations. We highlight the factors related to the overland vehicle drivers’ traffic safety violations and list the airport environment factors that may endanger drivers. We also provide a rationale for a cognitive approach to dynamic situation analysis, aimed at predicting driver violations and based on cognitive analysis within the Decision Support System (DSS) algorithm. We design a functional DSS model that can be used to control overland traffic safety at major airports, and elaborate on the sources of data for the predictive algorithm.}

The need for supporting companies in this transformation is currently covered by several maturity models, generally operationalized through standardized questionnaires, which provide, as an outcome, an assessment of the current maturity stage and a set of general improvement recommendations according to it. However, to provide companies with a more tangible support, there is a need for more individual approach. In order to deal with this need, this paper proposes, following a design science research framework, a novel approach based on Problem-Based Learning for structuring the assessment procedure as a dialectic process. This approach aims at facilitating the contextualization of the assessed company and, consequently, the identification of context-specific improvement recommendations. The proposed approach, supported by a maturity model used for framing information collected during the assessment process, is tested in three industrial cases. Although these have been assessed at the same maturity stage, different improvement recommendations have been proposed according to contextual factors such as strategic goals, core processes and key performance indicators.}

Enabled by artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain technology, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and the Internet of Things, this digital transformation is creating a paradigm shift in how we manage our GW resources. The next generation GW management tools are emerging with web-based GW management platforms following FAIR Data Principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. These web-based platforms can improve participation, cooperation, and collective action, and enable alternative forms of GW management such as commons-based peer management of GW resources. These web-based platforms not only provide comprehensive and timely information about the GW system with simulation and gaming tools, but also enable agents to work cooperatively. In this chapter, we discuss GW sustainability in a digital world using examples from both developing and developed countries. We show how these web-based platforms can provide historical and future-scenario information for strategic planning and development, and real-time information for daily decision-making. These web-based platforms can additionally facilitate cooperation among GW users through a blockchain-based system for GW credit, GW trading, and GW policy incentives, as an example. Furthermore, these we-based platforms do not only inform on GW systems, but also can be useful for other smart technologies such as smart agriculture, and smart city. Insights regarding the prospects of digital GW and the anticipated transformation of GW management practices are important for researchers, GW regulators, GW managers, GW users, and technology providers to plan for tomorrow.}

This paper builds on dynamic managerial capabilities theory to argue that managerial human capital—composed of leadership and entrepreneurial skills—is a critical facilitator of DBMT and resultant firm performance. Further, the research model proposes that managers' social capital and cognition positively moderate the relationship between human capital and DBMT. The study's findings from a sample of German Industry 4.0 firms provide new insights into the significance of managerial capabilities in a digital economy. This study advances management literature by demonstrating that the benefits of managers' human capital for DBMT are contingent on its form: entrepreneurial skills facilitate digital transformation integral for firm performance, while leadership skills have no impact on firm performance—neither directly nor indirectly through DBMT. Thus, this study provides strong evidence of the importance of entrepreneurial skills in driving DBMT to increase firm performance. Further, the findings offer a nuanced account of the interrelationships between dynamic managerial capabilities, revealing that higher levels of social capital and lower levels of cognition increase the positive effect of entrepreneurial skills on DBMT. This study altogether reaffirms the significance of managers' dynamic capabilities for strategic change enabled by DBMT and their performance benefits, yet it reveals that the effect mechanisms differ from those found in nondigital research settings.}

abstract = {Digital traceability (DT), as an important application of technology in the supply chain visibility field under digital transformation in manufacturing, is critical for food producers to guarantee food safety. The success of DT requires closer collaboration among all supply chain members. A big challenge for food producers is that most supply chain members show a disinclination to participate in DT initiatives. The involvement of participants through effective governance approaches oriented around the supply chain—either via formal contracts or informal relational governance—is therefore needed. Unfortunately, the way in which food producers can facilitate the success of DT through such governances is still unclear and lacks sufficient studies. Drawing upon the transaction cost theory and relational exchange theory, this study develops a conceptual model assuming that the contractual governance food producers adopt over their supply chain members can promote the success of DT, and the relationship between contractual governance and DT success is contingent on relational governance. The hierarchical regression method is employed to test hypotheses based on survey responses from 280 Chinese food producers in four provinces with national demonstration projects for the digital technology-enabled traceability system. The statistical results demonstrate that contractual governance has an inverse-U curvilinear effect (from positive to negative) on DT success. Moreover, relational governance moderates the impact of contractual governance on DT success. Specifically, a high level of relational governance mitigates the negative impact of contractual governance, and the joint use of relational governance and contractual governance could facilitate successful DT—but only in cases with higher relational governance. This study contributes to the literature by applying two theories to reveal how food producers can drive DT success through the adoption of governance approaches. It also provides useful managerial implications for food producers to effectively employ both types of governances over their supply chain members to achieve large-scale successful DT.}

To this end, Higher Education institutions reacted rather vastly to this unpreceded situation although many issues have been reported in the international literature since the emergence of the first global lockdown. As we are now transitioning back to the ‘normality’, universities and businesses consider the so-called ‘blended’ or ‘hybrid’ model as a means of facilitating the transition phase. In view of this decision, several studies can be identified wherein blended learning scenarios are proposed and described. The present work constitutes such an effort. Precisely, while adjusting the lens to the didactic of Robotics courses, we propose a blended learning model via which the laboratory activities are performed without the physical presence of the students in the physical context. The aforementioned objective is attained under the aid of the Virtual Reality technology coupled with the Digital Twin model. We hope that the ideas presented in this manuscript will motivate and inspire more researchers, instructional designers, and educators to consider the adoption of such alternative instructional techniques to mitigate the shortcomings that the remote education setting brings and further to improve the overall learning experience.}

In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period. A conceptual model was created by combining the diamond framework, the technology enactment framework, and enterprise architecture scope to facilitate the chronological analysis of these events and reflect upon the creation of flexibility. The findings indicate that DT in government spreads in waves with adaptations in different organizational elements, impacting the whole administrative system from the provincial level to the country level and including both radical and incremental changes. Flexibility increases alongside progress in DT and can be technology-enabled or policy-enabled. The creation of flexibility also depends on organizational elements and bureaucratic levels. This study advocates a cross-level view to comprehensively understand DT and offers insights to help other governments craft DT agenda.}

Thus, a twin transition is in motion facilitated by the New Industrial Strategy supporting the adoption of green business strategies across industrial ecosystems. This paper investigates whether the digital transformation and the decision to participate in public procurement as a transparent external funding source support adoption of business actions fostering sustainability transition. Data over more than 20,000 SMEs in the EU-28 over the period 2015–2019 complemented by country-specific attributes towards sustainability and institutional business environment are combined. Econometric results indicate that digital transformation fosters sustainability transition. Although participation in public tenders exerts a positive and systematic effect on the adoption of a sustainability supporting strategy, the two decisions appear independent indicating that SMEs are determined to shift the production paradigm irrespectively. Business operational problems affect but not deter sustainability transition. Business corruption in countries of low levels of sustainability impedes sustainable business actions, yet evidence favors higher transparency. The latter highlights the necessity towards building a coherent although adaptable institutional framework. This study contributes to SDGs 7, 12, 13 and 16.}

This research was conducted using a survey on a stratified random sample and the data was subsequently analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, and eta-coefficient. Multivariate analysis was applied to data obtained from 172 companies. The results showed that a number of factors determine the ways in which companies apply digital marketing and use differing levels of influence, amongst which the period of implementation, the abilities of people in charge for its usage, perception of digital marketing cost-effectiveness, measurability of its effects and sufficiency of traditional marketing have a key role. The period in which digital marketing is used was especially significant and notably affects the choice of digital marketing instruments, the way its performances are measured and the managers’ perception of its cost-effectiveness. Social networks were the most commonly used form of digital marketing in the market under analysis, and Google analytics was the most common way to measure the effects of digital marketing. Furthermore, the results showed that the more a company relies on the use of digital marketing in its business, the more significant its impact on promotion and brand positioning.}

Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

In this research we explore what are the key factors in the creation of collaborative networks between teachers. As a case study, we focus on the first steps of building a network of schools to promote digital education in Cantabria (northern Spain). With the participation of 11 schools, we conducted 22 interviews and 2 focus groups to analyze the learning environments of the teaching staff, the personal collaboration networks in the professional field, and the factors perceived as relevant in the design of the digital action plan of each school. The results showed the existence of teachers in each school who were pioneers in the digitization process and who acted as intermediaries both with the public educational administration and with teachers from other schools. During the interviews with these pioneers, we evaluated their personal networks as well as the factors they deem significant for an effective digital transformation. The results were contrasted in a public forum in which 120 teachers participated. Based on these results, we discuss how the creation of a network of key actors could contribute in developing the digital capacity of schools in the region.}

abstract = {This study's primary objective is to assess the impact of a city's sustainability index on the production of green electricity within a selection of 30 Chinese cities spanning the timeframe from 2000 to 2020. The findings unequivocally demonstrate that cities with a strong commitment to sustainability exhibit a marked propensity for expanding their sustainable electricity generation infrastructure. Moreover, the research underscores the pivotal role played by the development of information and communication technology in facilitating sustainable electricity production across these Chinese urban centers. Conversely, variables such as population growth, industrialization, tourism appeal, and poverty rates emerge as significant hindrances to the advancement of sustainable electricity generation in these cities. The implications gleaned from these findings point to a range of actionable policies, including the cultivation of green financial markets within sustainable cities, the digital transformation of urban landscapes, the expansion of ecotourism initiatives, and the implementation of poverty alleviation strategies in the remote regions of China.}

abstract = {In the era of digital economy, the economic model combining “substantial economy” and “digitalization” has spurred China's innovation activities, in particular energy technology innovation (ETI), with digital transformation (DT) becoming necessary for enterprises to stay competitive. However, how DT contributes to ETI remains unclear in both literature and practice. Recognizing their importance in ultimately sustaining enterprises' competitiveness, in this study we explore the nexus and mechanism between enterprise DT and ETI. In our research methodology, the data collected pertains to 1747 enterprises listed in A-shares from 2011 to 2019. We develop both static and dynamic benchmark regression models and a moderation effect model to test the relationships between DT and ETI. In addition, to address the endogeneity issue in model application, we introduce exogenous instrumental variables and adopt the generalized method of moment and a two-stage least square method. Our findings highlight that DT has not only a positive impact on ETI but also a heterogeneous effect on ETI in the types of enterprise ownerships and bias of energy technology progress. Moreover, it affects ETI mainly through total agency costs, financial technology, and research and development investment. Based on the findings, we offer policy recommendations for the coordination of digital economy and energy transition, providing guidance for developing countries. For example, digital platforms are recommended to be implemented at both the enterprise and national levels, in attempting to facilitate the development of digital economy and smart energy.}

abstract = {Smart Farming Technologies (SFT) are smart devices part of a cyber-physical system able to improve farm management. Compared to other digital technologies' functionalities, SFT generate a multitude of data that once combined can be used not only on-farm but across the entire supply chain. Although recent studies highlighted how the lack of users’ resources and competences might hinder the diffusion of digital agriculture technologies overall, few studies so far focused specifically on SFT. Moreover, the extant literature interprets the adoption decision mostly as “one-off binary” process, and limited attention is given to individual aspects of users and farms. Therefore, this study investigates the adoption of SFT analyzing various aspects of its complex nature; on the one hand, the analysis considers the multi-step nature of the adoption decision process: first, intention formation and then, actual adoption decision. On the other hand, the SFT adoption process is interpreted as being determined by several typologies of determinants beyond the most studied ones, with a particular focus on the role that organizational conditions and the supply chain governance structure play in influencing farmers' adoption of SFT. An empirical analysis is run on a sample of 474 responses, collected through an on-line survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and a Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression (ZIP) were used to investigate respectively the intention to use and the actual adoption of SFT. Results show that farmers' intention to use mainly relies on technologies' performance expectancy, technologies' complexity and social influence exerted on farmers, while organizational supporting conditions do not play a significant effect. Nonetheless, when the actual adoption decision is observed, the likelihood that non-adopters intend to adopt SFT in their farms increases when formal integration along the supply chain is high and with the dimension of the farm (in terms of both land size and sales). When the adopters are analyzed instead, the decision to adopt is positively affected only by the individual intention to use and by farmers' specialization in the arable sector. Findings reveal what factors need to be considered to guarantee a fairer and more inclusive agricultural digitalization, such as the role of social influence exerted by some figures around farmers and the still weak facilitating organizational conditions.}
