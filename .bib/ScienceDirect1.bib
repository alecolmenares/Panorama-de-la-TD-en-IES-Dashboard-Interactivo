This study aims to determine and analyze different DT strategies (DTSs) with the help of an integrated SWOT-based fuzzy AHP-MARCOS methodology that is proposed for the first time in the literature for this purpose. This methodology is validated with a case study concerning the airline industry in Turkey. The weights of the SWOT factors are determined with the fuzzy AHP method. The fuzzy MARCOS approach is used to select the most suitable DTS. The most appropriate strategy is obtained as “focusing on differentiated digital customer experience and service quality by the adaptation of business models to DT to provide benefits”.}

However, the experience and challenges of the Saudi healthcare system in adopting digital transformation have received little attention in the literature. Thus, this chapter aims to provide an overview of the digital transformation process in the Saudi healthcare system. The authors also shed light on the major challenges and suggested technology-based solutions. This chapter was written in light of the available global and local literature discussing the digitization of the health sector. Moreover, the Saudi governmental documents and official reports were utilized to include the latest updates and future plans for the local digital transformation strategy. In paving the way toward digital transformation, many challenges have been faced in areas such as medical records unification, technical infrastructure, and workforce capability. Solutions such as telemedicine applications, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and blockchain have been gradually applied to achieve the goal of transformation by 2030. Saudi Arabia's digital transformation began in 2018, with the implementation of the Vision 2030’s rapid digital change. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, a leap in utilizing digital health solutions has been noticed locally. Nevertheless, more action plans are needed to address the challenges and implement suitable solutions accordingly.}

abstract = {Greening, Digitizing and Redefining Aims in an Uncertain and Finite World: the triad facing the world in the immediate future as climate change, pandemic, digitization and the scramble for energy resources mark the challenges of an uncertain and finite world.
Purpose
Keeping in line with previous research on the social, commercial, and industrial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper has a dual objective: to extend the analysis in a common time frame by exploring additional indicators based on existing data sources and to analyse the relationships between EIDaD and R&D, comparing the pre- and post-COVID-19 scenarios.
Methodology
Numerous primary data sources within multiple available databases were studied, such as the EU dataset. These sources provide a range of indicators which, despite the scarcity of available literature, facilitate an empirical approach involving the quantitative analysis of the information they contain. A set of subsequent correlation analyses during Pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 were elaborated in order to explore the possible relationships between selected variables.
Structure
Previous research has shown that the IDR dataset facilitates the identification of early indicators of EIDaD and the expansion of EIDaD-related early indicators to key business ratios. This in turn allows comparisons between EIDaD and R&D to offer additional insight into how organizations can change the approach of their R&D and investment initiatives from reactive to proactive.
Findings
This paper sheds light on how R&D investments impact EIDaD initiatives and strongly suggests that organizations rethink how they approach entrepreneurship, innovation, digitization and digital transformation, using early indicators to facilitate better long-term decisions.
Originality
This paper shows that certain pre-pandemic strategic activities, such as R&D investments, may have influenced the behaviour of businesses, customers and society during the pandemic, and how wealth and economic value can be generated in a post-pandemic environment in the framework of a new economic model.
Practical implications
Organizations that succeed during a pandemic will serve as leadership models for the next generation of businesses, shaping the future of society as a whole. When early R&D investments bring about changes in the metrics that influence the recovery from the impact of a pandemic, they enhance the growth that can create jobs and offer new business opportunities in the new digital context.}

abstract = {As GovTech solutions are steadily entering the public sector, they have yet to find their way into the mainstream literature. GovTech refers to socio-technical solutions – that are developed and operated by private organisations – intertwined with public sector components for facilitating processes in the public sector. GovTech solutions promise a superior customer journey for citizens and businesses compared to current government portals and front desks. GovTech solutions can be a blessing in disguise for governments struggling in their digital transformation journey, carrying the burden of public service innovation and replacing legacy systems with modern GovTech solutions. Yet, there are also concerns that GovTech solutions are a Trojan horse, exploiting the lack of technical knowledge at public agencies and shifting decision-making power from public agencies to market parties, thereby undermining digital sovereignty and public values. This paper develops a research agenda for GovTech based on a conceptual framework. This framework reveals four interrelated design areas for GovTech: institutional, governance, technical and human-centred design. Governments can employ the conceptual framework to further align and develop their strategies by focussing on GovTech governance, referring to the ability to manage the various interdependencies between the four design areas.}

Yet, the use of AI in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. Prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of AI has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of AI technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of AI, particularly in public organizations. Building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop AI capabilities. To answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework (TOE) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in Europe about factors that influence their development of AI capabilities. We collected data from 91 municipalities from three European countries (i.e., Germany, Norway, and Finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that five factors – i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support – have an impact on the development of AI capabilities. We also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of AI solutions are not important determinants of AI capability formation. Our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of AI supporting managers in public organizations to develop AI capabilities.}

The sharp resource consumption by manufacturing firms predominantly causes them to meet public demands and maximize their revenue. The United Nations (UN) has urged businesses to follow eco-friendly practices to protect and revive nature. In this regard, it is imperative to investigate which factors facilitate firms in achieving the UN sustainable development goals. Using the lens of the stakeholder theory, this study delves into investigating the role of environmental and organizational factors in firms’ green innovation and sustainable development activities. Considering the imperative role of organizational capabilities to absorb and capitalize on the knowledge, the authors took knowledge absorptive capacity (KAC) as the moderating variable in the main model. The authors received data from manufacturing firms in Turkey and analyzed it through the PLS-SEM technique. It is found that organizational and environmental factors significantly help firms achieve green innovation and sustainable development goals. Moreover, the organizational capacity to absorb knowledge bolsters the relationship between the main hypotheses. However, an insignificant moderating role of KAC was identified between environmental factors and sustainable development. Considering environmental and organizational factors as driving forces of firm performance, this study links them with green innovation and sustainable development activities by integrating KAC as an acute boundary condition. The findings provide practical implications to industrialists and stakeholders for complying with the United Nations' sustainable development goals by capitalizing on studied variables.}

The VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) in Engineering Education has to be observed, studied, analysed and reformed and that too very soon. Higher Education is unable to evolve in pace with the technological developments, global economics, and digital transformations. Global networking has shrunk the world and established inter-connectedness breaking barriers of language, geography, societal cultures, and perceptions. However such rapid changes have not impacted Engineering Education much. Academicians prophecies about attributes that an engineer should possess are turning volatile. This uncertainty leads to unemployed engineers. The chaos has emerged with various levels of complexities. With under-skilled employees, the future of the Engineers and Engineering Education looks bleak and ambiguous. Jack of all trades will have more employable possibilities than the Master of a particular skill. The faculty who teach the 21st Century Learner therefore must make a conscious, intentional choice to enhance his competencies to prepare students for the future. This study emphasizes the need to reawaken our educational policies and teaching-learning pedagogy. Certain learning strategies like flipped learning, project-based learning, problem-based learning will adapt the andragogic method. The teaching trends will be metamorphosed and establish good networking for inter/transdisciplinary research. Case studies and scenario building will churn in opportunities for the students to communicate, collaborate, critically think, and be creative. The empowered faculty will have his multi-skilled students placed well, the student will be industry ready and the industry will have the employee come along with his 21st Century skill set. The beneficiaries: the school, university, teacher now a facilitator, the student and the community at large will build not only a sustainable future but a thriving one too!}

Drawing on a case study of Ghana's paperless port digital transformation and the technology affordance theory, we address the research question: “How can digital platformisation facilitate public sector transformation?” Based on the findings and the technology affordance theory, this study develops a transformational affordance framework (TAF) and offers propositions on how digital platforms can enable public sector transformation.}

For this, integrated and efficient capture, management, sharing, and use of agricultural and environmental data from multiple sources is essential. However, there are challenges to understand and efficiently use different types of agricultural and environmental data from multiple sources, which differ in format and time interval. In this regard, the role of emerging technologies is considered to be significant for integrated data gathering, analyses and efficient use. In this study, a concept was developed to facilitate the full integration of digital technologies to enhance future smart and sustainable agricultural systems. The concept has been developed based on the results of a literature review and diverse experiences and expertise which enabled the identification of stat-of-the-art smart technologies, challenges and knowledge gaps. The features of the proposed solution include: data collection methodologies using smart digital tools; platforms for data handling and sharing; application of Artificial Intelligent for data integration and analysis; edge and cloud computing; application of Blockchain, decision support system; and a governance and data security system. The study identified the potential positive implications i.e. the implementation of the concept could increase data value, farm productivity, effectiveness in monitoring of farm operations and decision making, and provide innovative farm business models. The concept could contribute to an overall increase in the competitiveness, sustainability, and resilience of the agricultural sector as well as digital transformation in agriculture and rural areas. This study also provided future research direction in relation to the proposed concept. The results will benefit researchers, practitioners, developers of smart tools, and policy makers supporting the transition to smarter and more sustainable agriculture systems.}

Learning objectives for existing courses were analysed to establish product opportunities. SWOT and Matrix methods were applied to a range of eXtended Reality solutions to establish product fit. Further, project resources were measured to define constraints and opportunities. It was established that competencies that develop basic familiarity, operating and reporting skills are important in the undergraduate curriculum of chemical engineering students, whilst facilitating the development of many of these skills is possible using eXtended Reality solutions. In January 2022, four 360-VR unit operation experiments were fully commissioned for use by students and other stakeholders as part of the courses offered at the pilot-scale plant facilities of DTU.CBE.

Today, Industry 4.0 technologies, such as Big Data analytics and mobile technologies, are forcing firms to seek new ways to create and deliver customer value. We argue that the Android project, one of the most successful open-source digital platforms, reflects a new business model in the age of digital transformation. In the Android community, application developers create and sell applications for the Android operating system provided by the open-source firm (Google), and share the profit with Google. Such an open-source strategy forces the open-source firm to give up the profits from selling the operating system to customers. A firm generally chooses an open-source strategy to increase its user network size. Using the concept of creative intensity, or the speed of idea generation, we offer a new explanation regarding the benefits of an open-source strategy in the age of digital transformation. We investigate how to enhance creative intensity and profit on the open-source digital platform. Our model suggests that an open-source strategy effectively manages the diminishing value of ideas and, thus, facilitates the dynamic capability of an open-source firm.}

A validated digital transformation framework was applied to 346 companies for data collection and subsequent statistical treatment. Almost 60% of the Brazilian MSEs are at primary levels of digital maturity, with 19.1% being unconscious about the digitization process. Digital maturity was shown to be statistically correlated with innovations (p = 0.000) and business revenue (p = 0.009), suggesting that these factors are facilitators in the MSEs digitization. This paper pointed to the urgency of efforts on the part of companies and policy makers in Brazil to implement actions that can foster behaviors, capabilities, and enablers to digital transformation. These findings can allow in-depth discussions and aligned strategies among emerging economies to point out best practices for companies inserted in markets with similar characteristics and challenges.}

Following a survey strategy (n = 244), the study demonstrates that both individual interests and organisational challenges define the shared domain of interest and constitute the motivational factors for joining a VCoP. We identify four roles of engagement: knowledge provider, practitioner, facilitator, and learner, appreciating both self-paced learning and peer interaction facilitated by multiple digital tools. The organisational type as an exemplary characteristic of members correlates with various VCoP elements. An open member structure results in volatile requirements of the VCoP, why we finally discuss agile project management methodology for VCoP delivery.}

These include telemedicine, which extends the boundaries of care and creates new opportunities for relationships between patients and physicians. Despite widespread enthusiasm, at the heart of the process of recognizing these innovations is the patient. Consequently, understanding those variables and acceptance factors that promote good telemedicine practices is crucial. Using a qualitative research approach and relying on multiple case studies, our research demonstrates the role of telemedicine as a vehicle for social impact and translation of medical knowledge. Furthermore, by testing the technology acceptance model with the selected case studies, we find that telemedicine projects should include critical variables such as social influence, facilitating conditions, trust between physicians and patients, privacy, perceived risk technology anxiety, and resistance towards technology. Only by understanding and correctly designing acceptance factors, it will be possible to promote positive telemedicine experiences and obtain the proper cooperation from patients. Although pieces of research aim to have theoretical implications, we like to think that these results are intended for policy-makers, health care managers, medical doctors and nurses who aim to introduce technological advances in health care.}

But it also entails recruiting new employees, as well as re- and upskilling current employees of diverse ages groups for new and increasingly more complex tasks to manage increasingly more complex information. In this article we present an overview and meta perspective on serious games as a human-centric methodology. We discuss how these can contribute to 1) learning how operators react to complex situations and how they deal with incomplete, uncertain, or fuzzy information, 2) understanding how operators of production systems and production networks can be supported by human-centric industrial user interfaces, and 3) enable operators to act appropriately in complex and dynamic cyber-physical production systems. We present an actionable adaptable iterative process model for designing serious games and exemplify this model using a supply chain and quality management serious game. Further, we present empirical studies that illustrate the application of the model and suggest the utility of serious games as a learning environment, to evaluate industrial user interfaces, and to investigate human behavior in complex production environments. As such, we propose serious games as a versatile methodology to facilitate transitioning from Industry 4.0 (data-driven and interconnected) to Industry 5.0 (humane work and sustainability).}

abstract = {In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), rapid development in innovative technologies facilitates the adoption of smart facilities management (FM) in the built environment industry to improve sustainability and digitalization. The Singapore government has realized the enormous potential of smart FM in developing a sustainable city and has implemented several initiatives to promote its adoption. However, the adoption of smart FM in the built environment industry is still in its early stage. Therefore, this study aims to (1) investigate drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM; and (2) explore whether there are significant differences in the perceived importance of the drivers, barriers, and strategies by designations and years of experience. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted to identify 6 drivers, 13 barriers, and 10 strategies. A survey questionnaire was designed and then validated by pilot interviews to collect data from practitioners in the built environment industry. Post-survey interviews were also carried out to validate the analysis results from the questionnaire survey. The study identified that increased energy savings, improved sustainability, and reduced downtime are the three most important drivers. Poor data management, high initial cost, and high cybersecurity risks are the three most important barriers. Development of technology selection mechanisms, improvement of smart FM system, and increased amount of funding are the three most effective strategies to address the challenges. Designations and years of experience have been proved to affect the perceptions of the importance of drivers, barriers, and strategies. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM, offering a starting point for organizations to consider its adoption. This study also enriches the knowledge of smart FM in the built environment industry with the expectations of facilitating the digital transformation and sustainable development of the built environment industry.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics.
OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance.
METHODS
This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world.
SIGNIFICANCE
Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers.}

The transfer of experience-based knowledge in a flexible and self-optimizing production and process planning offers the potential to meet these challenges. Biological systems solve conceptually similar challenges pertaining to the transfer of knowledge, flexibility of individual reactions and adaptation over time. Thus, in the context of digital transformation, mechanisms derived from biology are interpreted and applied to the knowledge domain of production technology. To be able to exploit the potential of bio-inspired production systems, genetic and intelligent properties of technical components and machines were identified and brought together under the concept of “Gentelligence”. Expanding upon this concept with the new idea of process-DNA and biologically inspired optimization algorithms facilitates a more flexible, learning and self-optimizing production, which is shown in three different applications. By using the new concept of gentelligent process planning it is possible to determine machine-specific process parameters in turning processes in order to ensure appropriate roughness within the requirements. Furthermore, the combination of the concept with a material removal simulation allows the determination of the resulting process force in tool grinding for subsequent unknown workpiece geometries. As a result of using the process-DNA, a workpiece-independent knowledge transfer and thus process adaptation for shape error compensation becomes possible. Gentelligent production scheduling enables a process-parallel, holistically optimized machine allocation, and as a result, a significantly reduced lead time.}

We collected data from 198 United Arab Emirate users who had previously used mHealth apps to improve their self-healthcare. The findings suggested that the intention of using this technology is positively influenced by: (1) the levels of performance expectancy and facilitating conditions concerning the use, (2) the level of gamification impact, and (3) the degree of personal innovativeness in the simple design of mHealth apps. These findings extend the theoretical concept of the UTAUT model in mobile healthcare technology. The value of the study lies in constructing an integrated digital transformation model that will assist healthcare companies in comprehending the influence of available resources and lead them to invest significantly in the incumbent digital infrastructure. The findings shall help healthcare practitioners identify critical drivers and key challenges faced by stakeholders concerning mobile health app use in an emerging Arab country that has the vision to improve its healthcare through digital transformation.}

Although process informatics has attracted much attention, physical models are essential to realizing the digital twins. However, building a physical model of an industrial process takes much toil. We aim to facilitate the physical model building by developing an automated physical model building AI, named AutoPMoB, which performs five tasks: 1) retrieving documents about a target process from literature databases, 2) converting the format of each document to HTML format, 3) extracting information required for building a physical model from the documents, such as variables, equations, and experimental data, 4) judging the equivalence of the information extracted from different documents, and 5) reorganizing the information to output a desired physical model. This study focuses on task 4, especially judging the equivalence of variable definitions, i.e., whether two noun phrases represent the same variable. We created a large-scale corpus consisting of papers on chemical engineering, and built ProcessBERT, which is a domain-specific language model pre-trained on the corpus. We proposed a method for judging the equivalence of variable definitions based on ProcessBERT. When judging the equivalence, our proposed method first uses ProcessBERT to obtain the embeddings of the variable definitions. Then, the method calculates the cosine similarity between the embeddings. The method judges that the two definitions are equivalent when the similarity is larger than a threshold. Our proposed method judged the equivalence with higher accuracy than the method based on original BERT and SciBERT.}

In this article, I present a framework intended to assist efforts to address one of the first of these challenges: assessment of organizational AI readiness—that is, an organization’s ability to deploy AI technologies to enable digital transformation, in four key dimensions: technologies, activities, boundaries, and goals. I show that this framework can facilitate analysis both of an organization’s current sociotechnical AI status and of the prospects for the technology’s fuller value-adding, sociotechnical deployment.

In terms of identifying and recommending advertisements, improving the accuracy of advertisement promotion and identification is an urgent need. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are of practical application to facilitate digital transformation in the advertising industry. Among the many AI methods, the network model based on the genetic algorithm back propagation (GABP) neural network is the most compatible with applications in the advertising industry. In this work, the GABP neural network is applied in the construction of social networks to predict the click-through rate (CTR) of website advertising applications through the optimization of advertising promotion strategies. In the processes of optimizing and improving the system model using AI methods, the technological focus is the accuracy of advertising promotion and identification for the developing advertising industry. First, background information on the era of internet and AI development is analyzed. The new media technology is discussed through AI research and traditional advertising industry literature. In addition, a CTR prediction model is created for advertising applications based on the GABP network. In the neural network improvement process, the performance of GABP is enhanced through multiple iterations by optimizing the application strategy of advertising scenarios according to the topology of network connections. The study results demonstrate that different algorithms' recognition accuracy and precision show an increasing trend as the number of model iterations increases. The recognition accuracy of GABP increases from 49 % to 72 %, and the recognition precision of the algorithm increases from 69 % to 86 %. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the GABP network is only 0.6 before the number of neurons increases. When the number of neurons is 400, the AUC value of the algorithm reaches 0.82, and the comprehensive diagnostic value of the system dramatically improves. This research has significant reference value for reforming the traditional advertising work mode, enhancing intellectual development and promoting resource efficiency in the advertising industry.}

The interface of a component is deliberately defined separately from the component’s implementation to define entry points, and at the same time prevent access to the component’s internal resources and logic. Another advantage is that replacing the implementation of one component with another that has a same interface enables continuous consumption because how a component internally meets the requirements of the interface is irrelevant to its consumer. This paper investigates the possibilities to introduce the notion of interface in capability-oriented IS engineering. Capability Driven Development (CDD) is an example of a methodological approach for configuring dynamic, context aware, re-deployable business capabilities on top of existing enterprise information systems to enable continuous delivery of business for varying situational contexts. CDD relies on capability as the central component that integrates other elements of organizational design such as goals, KPIs, context information, processes, resources, and software services. These elements produce and use lot of different data, internal as well as external. In order to facilitate the uptake and use of capabilities, most of the necessary data should be made available for the use by the consumers of the capability. In this study, we provide an initial view on how the data interface of the capability component should be defined. The proposal is illustrated on the service concerning a regional roads maintenance.}

Digital technology (DT) is considered to be a crucial enabler of a PSS that facilitates CE integration in businesses. While discussions concerning the capacity of DT to overcome the main challenges posed by CE are growing, the specific evolution path of a PSS that can evolve to the level required by a CE and for the development of DT for each PSS type have not been widely explored. This paper reviewed a multiple-case study involving three manufacturing firms that each used PSS in business evolution projects and proposes guiding principles that can be used to support an effective approach to using the PSS to facilitate a CE at the business evolution stage. Moreover, in this systematic approach, DT impacts PSS deployment by acting as an enabler. The results contribute to theory by advancing the discussion exploring the potential relation between business evolution and circular principles through the mapping of PSS types. Explicit knowledge of the design principles behind PSS approaches can be obtained by analyzing this relationship. In addition, precise DT adaptation has been found in this study to be able to integrate toolsets that satisfy a variety of product demands and productivity plans by using specific technology to develop iterations for increasing service quality. From a practical perspective, this paper can help practitioners navigate the evolution of their businesses through the PSS model to enable a CE that is based on their existing digital and business capabilities.}

We then develop a preliminary theoretical model based on the interview findings and conduct a survey to test our research model. The empirical results suggest that three platform mechanisms, namely member credibility, blockchain certificate, and structural assurance, significantly facilitate the three trust targets, which subsequently enhance individuals' behavioral intentions. A mediation analysis further demonstrates that the three trust targets partially or fully mediate the influences of three platform mechanisms on behavioral intentions through different path relationships. Our study contributes to the extant literature by uncovering the nomological network among three specific trust targets and explicating their antecedents as well as behavioral outcomes in the emerging context of blockchain-enabled applications.}

New management approaches, flexibility of operations as well as product- and service-related innovativeness determines SMEs survival and development. As service SMEs start to compete more openly, rather than locally, their owners and managers have to stay alert and ready for changes. As digitization is beginning the factor which strongly influence how innovation processes are or can be implemented, also service SMEs should be actively aware of how digital transformation affects their environment. Emerging digital tools that aim to support the innovation process also influence its possible modifications, bringing a number of possible benefits and optimisations.

Furthermore, the combination of the concept with a material removal simulation allows the determination of the resulting process force in tool grinding for subsequent unknown workpiece geometries. As a result of using the process-DNA, a workpiece-independent knowledge transfer and thus process adaptation for shape error compensation becomes possible. Gentelligent production scheduling enables a process-parallel, holistically optimized machine allocation, and as a result, a significantly reduced lead time.}

Our systematic literature review identifies key trends in advanced maintenance techniques and the consolidation of traditional maintenance concepts, which are driven by the increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the need to optimize manufacturing systems' performance and reliability. In light of our findings, we highlight the importance of addressing sustainability factors, human aspects, and the implementation of environmental KPIs in future research. Building upon these insights, we introduce the Maintenance 5.0 framework, which emphasizes the integration of human-centered and AI-driven strategies for achieving efficient and sustainable maintenance in Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) systems. We propose a novel framework that links traditional and advanced maintenance policies for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in the maintenance field. This work underscores the need for future research to bridge the gap between these policies, enabling a seamless transition for SMEs towards Industry 4.0 maintenance practices, while fostering sustainable and socially responsible operations.}

It also facilitates work and improves work outcomes in care systems. Currently, in European Union member states, many older adults seek acceptance to nursing homes too early. Current capacities of available nursing homes are in several member states insufficient to cater to increasing demand from the ageing population. How to prolong living in the community and postpone the reallocation to the nursing home is a major challenge in the European ageing society. According to the Web of Science, in the last 20 years, there has been growing research interest in ambient assisted living. Until now, the field of nursing and the field of social care in many member states are not integrated sufficiently, resulting in increased expenditures for nursing and social care on one hand and lack of services provided for a growing number of older adults with declining functional capabilities on the other hand. This paper aims to review the literature on the ambient assisted living and introduce the multiple decrement model for the measurement of efficiency of developed ambient assisted living technologies that are incorporated into the systems for management and control of long-term care services. Based on the proposed model, the future research agenda is outlined.}

Through a systematic literature review, a holistic business model framework is developed, which is then used to analyse the empirical evidence from the creative industries. The research found that digital technologies have facilitated pervasive changes in business models, and some significant trends have emerged. However, the reconfigured business models are often not ‘new’ in the unprecedented sense. Business model innovations are primarily reflected in using digital technologies to enable the deployment of a wider range of business models than previously available to a firm. A significant emerging trend is the increasing adoption of multiple business models as a portfolio within one firm. This is happening in firms of all sizes, when one firm uses multiple business models to serve different markets segments, sell different products, or engage with multi-sided markets, or to use different business models over time. The holistic business model framework is refined and extended through a recursive learning process, which can serve both as a cognitive instrument for understanding business models and a planning tool for business model innovations. The paper contributes to our understanding of the theory of business models and how digital technologies facilitate business model innovations in the creative industries. Three new themes for future research are highlighted.}

Many consumers are adopting and using AI-based apps, devices, and services in their everyday lives. However, research examining consumer behavior in using AI apps is scant. We examine critical factors in AI app adoption by extending and validating a well-established unified theory of adoption and use of technology, UTAUT2. We also explore the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in consumers’ behavior, including potentially relevant segments of AI app adopters. To augment the knowledge of end users’ engagement and relevant segments, we have added two new antecedent variables into UTAUT2: technology fear and consumer trust. Prediction-orientated segmentation was used on 740 valid responses collected using a pre-tested survey instrument. The results show five segments with different behaviors that were influenced by the variables of the proposed model. Once known, the profiles were used to propose apps to AI developers to improve consumer engagement. The moderating effects of the added variables—technology fear and consumer trust—are also shown. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings and propose priorities for future research.}

The results show that IoT and Big Data are predominantly reengineering factors for business processes, products and services; however, a lack of widespread knowledge and adoption has led research to evolve into multiple, yet inconsistent paths. The study offers interesting implications for managers and marketers, highlighting how the digital transformation enabled by IoT and Big Data can positively impact many facets of business. By treating IoT and Big Data as faces of the same coin, this study also sheds light on current challenges and opportunities, with the hope of informing future research and practice.}

The paper aims to explore the underpinning mechanisms of a Higher Education Institution in managing digital transformation and capitalizing upon the benefits of digital technologies amidst extreme uncertainty. We engage in a qualitative, in-depth case study of a UK-based Higher Education Institution to empirically explore the combination of digital technologies and transfiguration of its organizational dimensions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight three mechanisms: fostering technologies to stay afloat, scaling functionalities to create new value, and justifying value to design change. Our contribution is threefold. First, we capture the conjugation of digital technologies and transfiguration of business processes, strategy, and culture in a paradigmatic case of digital transformation. Second, we articulate the mechanisms through which our case organization managed such transformation.

Accordingly, this study explores the Data Science Roadmapping (DSR) to guide organizations in aligning their business strategies with data-related, technological, and organizational resources. The proposed approach is built on the widely adopted technology roadmapping framework and customizes its context, architecture, and process by synthesizing data science, big data, and data-driven organization literature. Based on industry collaborations, the framework provides a hybrid and agile methodology comprising the recommended steps. We applied DSR with a research group with sector experience to create a comprehensive data science roadmap to validate and refine the framework. The results indicate that the framework facilitates DSR initiatives by creating a comprehensive roadmap capturing strategy, data, technology, and organizational perspectives. The contemporary literature illustrates prebuilt roadmaps to help businesses become data-driven. However, becoming data-driven also necessitates significant social change toward openness and trust. The DSR initiative can facilitate this social change by opening communication channels, aligning perspectives, and generating consensus among stakeholders.}

This work adopts a resource-based view (RBV) to explore the potential role that digital technologies play in the cultivation of a manufacturing firm's competitive advantage, and the deployment of existing internal resources and core competencies to achieve net-zero manufacturing emissions and CE. Two questions are addressed: (1) What competitive advantage(s) may be derived from the integration of digital technologies to achieve net-zero manufacturing emissions, and (2) does adopting an RBV facilitate the development of meaningful (and novel) competitive advantage? Engaged scholarship is used to analyse and apply theory to an empirical, real-world dataset documenting the perspectives and experiences of 13 manufacturing firms. Applying the VRIO framework, 21 identified digital technology-based core competencies are categorised as forms of competitive advantage that may be possible for manufacturing firms pursuing net-zero emissions. Four scenarios of digital technology adoption pathways are proposed, differentiated by the degree of radical vs. incremental interests and options available to the firm. This study highlights the critical need for firms to incorporate intangible asset management and development, including the labour and supply chain relationships, as part of their digital transformation strategies. Further, we demonstrate the potential of RBV as a lens for evaluating the competitive advantage potential of corporate sustainability initiatives, and facilitating the development of related strategies.}

GS countries are trying to leverage their growing demand for innovative products and services to negotiate the uptake of novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).

However, a misaligned AI-adoption strategy entails the risk of alienating the social, economic, and even cultural requirements of such countries, ultimately leading to the incorporation of technologies not serving the needs of their users. Subsequently, we conduct a study whose goal is to provide guidelines on how to perform a comprehensive analysis of the AI ecosystems in GS countries, to determine their readiness to adopt and utilize beneficially these technologies. For this, we performed a qualitative case study of two GS countries, namely Senegal and Cambodia. The depiction of their AI ecosystems unveiled the need to stimulate their societies (i.e., by media exposure, education, etc.) in discerning the practical effects of AI. However, an impactful AI implementation requires a reciprocated satisfaction of the needs of multiple contributing actors. Finally, particular recommendations are offered at the level of these countries’ academic, industrial, and governmental constitutions, suggesting to focalize their resources in order to better energize (and optimally disperse) their research and entrepreneurial capabilities that could help identify the ways in which AI solutions can be of added-value within the premises of these two countries.}

A survey was administered to patients who had used a teleconsultation platform during the pandemic period. As one of the largest studies to date, a sample of 1233 respondents was collected and analyzed using a partial least squares approach, often mobilized in the information systems (IS) domain. Furthermore, a deep analysis using all recommended metrics was performed. The results highlight the significance of trusting beliefs, and self-efficacy in the adoption of digital healthcare services.

Faced with increasing difficulties in financing transport infrastructure, many countries are seeking to allocate their resources in such a way as to maximize net returns. In order to facilitate such distribution, it is necessary to fully understand all the large–scale consequences of infrastructure investments. Transport infrastructure can be defined as a factor that guarantees growth and economic development, thanks to the functions of crossing space in terms of the movement of people and the exchange of goods. The effect of the impact of transport infrastructure on the economy largely depends on how society uses the services offered by infrastructure facilities (Mottaeva & Nechaeva, 2021). Infrastructure, as a factor that activates socio–economic progress, is also one of the important factors determining the living conditions of the population. It is widely believed that improper planning and implementation of an infrastructure project can have a negative impact on the economy and environment of the region. In some cases, infrastructure investments may pose a threat to communities that will be directly affected by this project.}

abstract = {Digital Transformation (DT) is increasingly vital for healthcare organisations. It is yielding new ways to address quality of care, medical practice, management and, generally, value creation for all the various actors of a healthcare ecosystem. However, implementing DT in healthcare is not straightforward. It requires simultaneously considering technological, political, social, cultural and economic aspects in innovating and delivering services. Moreover, it entails listening to and involving the heterogeneous set of actors in the healthcare ecosystem, in line with user-driven and open innovation logic. Recently Innovation Labs have been acknowledged as an initiative to facilitate innovation, supporting users, customers, and organisations in tackling and providing solutions to business changes and DT challenges. However, there is still a lack of understanding to what extent Innovation Labs can support the digital transformation of healthcare organisations. Through an in-depth case study of a Health Innovation Lab, this paper sheds more light on the role of Innovation Labs and their management as catalysers of innovation and DT in healthcare settings. The research contributes to defining and enhancing the understanding of the structure, functioning and management of Innovation Labs in healthcare organisations. Thus, it explores the potential of Innovation Labs in healthcare settings. From a practical perspective, the study provides suggestions and guidelines for managing healthcare Innovation Labs. It identifies common pitfalls to avoid, as well as best practices and tools to foster DT.}

Although these sectors rely heavily on product customization and short manufacturing cycles, they are still not able to take full advantage of the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 surfaced to address the current challenges of shorter product life-cycles, highly customized products and stiff global competition. The new manufacturing paradigm supports the development of modular factory structures within a computerized Internet of Things environment. With Industry 4.0, rigid planning and production processes can be revolutionized. However, the computerization of manufacturing has a high degree of complexity and its implementation tends to be expensive, which goes against the reality of SMEs that power the traditional sectors. This paper reviews the main scientific-technological advances that have been developed in recent years in traditional sectors with the aim of facilitating the transition to the new industry standard.}

A model is proposed to determine which aspects of principal leadership influence EDR use, and factor analysis is conducted with all the items included in the model. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) variance analysis is then used to perform a factor analysis of the resulting dimensions. The model is tested with a sample of 142 Spanish school principals. The results show that how useful school principals perceive EDRs to be is the most influential variable in the digital transformation of schools. Other key factors include school contextual variables, the technical support and service related to the EDRs, and the principal's professional and personal profile. Educational policies for digital transformation should thus integrate principals into their core definition, considering factors such as their age or teaching and leadership experience. They should also consider contextual factors, such as school size and complexity and the school's digital culture. School principals' leadership can facilitate a digital culture transformation, not through their authority or bureaucratic influence, but rather their capacity to foster an open debate that allows educational communities to see the integration of EDRs into pedagogical models as an opportunity to improve outcomes.}

Due to this network connectivity between people, organizations, resources and entire industries, value and economic growth can be generated within the interactive ecosystem of digital platforms. The special feature of this business model is that competitive advantages, contrary to dominant paradigms, do not primarily rely on the physical infrastructure or the control over scarce and valuable resources. Despite the high practical relevance, little systematic knowledge exists on why platform-based business models often outperform traditional pipeline businesses in many respects. We contribute to this research gap by exploring the critical success factors of platform business models. Based on a qualitative analysis on digital platforms in the metal and steel industry, we identify six key success factors of platform-based business models: We relate these success factors to the design of the three dimensions of business models as described in the literature: (1) value creation, (2) value delivery, and (3) value capture dimensions. Furthermore, our analysis could extend these and design features of the business model by three additional success factors (4) the promotion and sensitization of digital transformation, (5) a suitable platform architecture and strategic judgement of platform providers, as well as (6) the promotion of a start-up culture as central success factors.}

Digital transformation in the banking sector is a continuous process that affects both the external and internal environment by redesigning internal processes and existing methods. There are many reasons that digital transformation takes place, such as servicing remote areas without physical branches, differentiation from competitors or reduction of operating costs. In any case, there are a lot of doubts about the acceptance of digital technologies. Thus, this article examines the acceptance rate of digital transformation in the banking sector in Greece. One hundred and sixty-one employees at Greek banks completed the survey. A Multivariate Regression Analysis was implemented to analyze the items of the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings of this paper indicate the perception of bank employees with regard to new technologies. This paper provides a practical contribution for executives of Greek banking organizations to schedule targeted educational programs to facilitate the transition to the new digital era for their employees. Executives are curious if employees are ready to accept and implement digitalization in their daily job routine. Therefore, the Technology Acceptance Model can provide answers to executives in facing these challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Currently, health care is expert-centric, especially with regard to decision-making. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) or interconnected electronic health records (EHRs) suffer from low adoption rates. In the rare cases of technically successful implementation, they often result in inefficient or error-prone processes.
Aim & Methods
This paper explores the state of the art in AI-based digital decision support systems (DDSSs). To overcome the low adoption rates, we propose a systematic strategy for bringing DDSS research into clinical practice based on a design science approach. DDSSs can transform health care to be more innovative, patient-centric, accurate and efficient. We contribute by providing a framework for the successful development, evaluation and analysis of systems for AI-based decision-making. This framework is then evaluated using focus group interviews.
Results
Centred around our framework, we define a systematic approach for the use of AI in health care. Our systematic AI support approach highlights essential perspectives on DDSSs for systematic development and analysis. The aim is to develop and promote robust and optimal practices for clinical investigation and evaluation of DDSS in order to encourage their adoption rates. The framework contains the following dimensions: disease, data, technology, user groups, validation, decision and maturity.
Conclusion
DDSSs focusing on only one framework dimension are generally not successful; therefore, we propose to consider each framework dimension during analysis, design, implementation and evaluation so as to raise the number of DDSSs used in clinical practice.
Public Interest Summary
The digital transformation of the healthcare sector creates the potential for the sector to be more accurate, efficient and patient-centric using AI, or so-called digital decision support systems. In this research, we explore why these systems are needed and how they can be successfully implemented in clinical practice. For this, we propose a systematic approach based on our conceptual framework. Against this background, we present our vision for further advancing these technologies. We see our systematic AI support as a primary driver, with the possibility to facilitate the much-needed breakthrough of decision support systems in health care.}

Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer’s buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.}

The C♭-model is a theoretical framework that systematizes contextual factors, which influence students‘ learning activities as the most important facilitator of students’ learning success. Using a self-assessment instrument with anchored scenarios in a sample of 1625 higher education teachers, we were able to identify three levels at which higher education teachers initiated digital learning activities: a low level (powerpointers), a moderate level (clickerers), and a high level (digital pros). The findings also support the relevance of the contextual factors specified in the C♭-model for initiating a high level of digital learning activities, namely digitalization policy and commitment of university administration, institutional equipment, technical and educational support, self-assessed basic digital skills, and self-assessed technology-related teaching skills. All of these factors explain a substantial amount of variance in the level of initiated digital learning activities. We conclude that a comprehensive approach rather than isolated measures might contribute to successful teaching and learning in higher education.}

Owing to the lack of research in emerging Asian nations, this research aimed to unearth the determinants of blockchain acceptance for supply chain financing by a Bangladeshi financing company called IPDC. Centred on a technology acceptance framework called UTAUT (unified theory of acceptance and use of technology) and open innovation research, an expanded model with a mediating variable is developed for this study. This research work employs the deductive inference method in conjunction with the positivism paradigm. A structural questionnaire was used to gather data, which were then processed through Smart-PLS (partial least square) for SEM (structural equation modeling). The survey includes all the people who are directly or indirectly involved in the supply chain financing platform of IPDC. The study consists of seven direct hypotheses and one mediating hypothesis. The results show that all the direct hypotheses except the impact of social influence on the behavioural intention to use (BINTU) blockchain are significant. The mediating hypothesis indicating the role of BINTU in the relationship between facilitating conditions (FCON) and the actual use of blockchain is also supported. FCON and BINTU together explain 88.7% variation in blockchain use behaviour for supply chain financing. The research advances past findings by employing an expanded UTAUT framework and validating observations with the other relevant studies throughout the world.}

It greatly facilitates the digitalization of user data, environment conditions, and interaction process, which makes digital transformation (DT) feasible in smart home context to help create innovative life services and additional user values. Cross-device interaction has thusly become an important measure in realizing DT in smart home areas, and related studies are growing rapidly. Unlike previous reviews, which mainly focus on the historical development, the applications and evaluation strategies of cross-device interaction, a user-centric perspective was proposed in this work to emphasize the user experience and user values. For the purpose, a systematic literature review approach was developed, and 130 articles in recent 15 years were obtained and reviewed. Through text mining and bibliometric analysis, the topics attracting higher research attention were identified. Following the identified research spots, the related works were analyzed from the aspects of (i) main services supported by cross-device interaction, (ii) common interaction configurations for different service purposes, and (iii) user-perceived values brought by cross-device interaction. Moreover, the challenges which hinder the deepened digitalization of smart home systems were discussed, including data quality, user experience and system safety issues. Accordingly, future development opportunities in the further integration of emerging digital technologies, attempts in natural interaction, and extension of smart home scenarios were suggested. This review is expected to help researchers better understand the role of cross-device interaction in digitalizing a complex smart home system, provide references on effective configuration of interaction systems for different purposes, and shed light on future development directions in this area.}

The C♭-model aims at systematizing research on digital teaching and learning and offers a roadmap for future research to understand the complex dynamic of factors that lead to successful digital teaching and learning in higher education via suitable learning activities. First, we introduce students' learning outcomes as central benchmarks of teaching and learning with digital technologies in higher education. Second, we want to focus on a major proximal factor for students' learning outcomes and thus apply a learning activities perspective. Learning activities involving digital technologies reflect cognitive processes of students when using digital technologies and are causally connected with students' learning outcomes. Third, we highlight several contextual facilitators for learning activities involving technology in the C♭-model: learning opportunities that result from higher education teachers' instructional use of technology and students' self-arranged learning opportunities involving digital technologies. Apart from these proximal facilitators, we include more distal factors, namely, higher education teachers' knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward digital technology; higher education teachers' qualification; students' and teachers’ digital technology equipment; and institutional, organizational, and administrative factors.}

abstract = {Recently, the NMBP-35 Horizon 2020 projects - NanoMECommons, CHARISMA, and Easi-stress - organised a collaborative workshop to increase awareness of their contributions to the industry "commons" in terms of characterisation and digital transformation. They have established interoperability standards for knowledge management in characterisation and introduced new solutions for materials testing, aided by the standardisation of faster and more accurate assessment methods. The lessons learned from these projects and the discussions during the joint workshop emphasised the impact of recent developments and emerging needs in the field of characterisation. Specifically, the focus was on enhancing data quality through harmonisation and standardisation, as well as making advanced technologies and instruments accessible to a broader community with the goal of fostering increased trust in new products and a more skilled society. Experts also highlighted how characterisation and the corresponding experimental data can drive future innovation agendas towards technological breakthroughs. The focus of the discussion revolved around the characterisation and standardisation processes, along with the collection of modelling and characterisation tools, as well as protocols for data exchange. The broader context of materials characterisation and modelling within the materials community was explored, drawing insights from the Materials 2030 Roadmap and the experiences gained from NMBP-35 projects. This whitepaper has the objective of addressing common challenges encountered by the materials community, illuminating emerging trends and evolving techniques, and presenting the industry's perspective on emerging requirements and past success stories. It accomplishes this by providing specific examples and highlighting how these experiences can create fresh opportunities and strategies for newcomers entering the market. These advancements are anticipated to facilitate a more efficient transition from Industry 4.0 to 5.0 during the industrial revolution.}

abstract = {Background: Mobile phone users have increased exponentially in the past decade. Present-day mobile phones can serve several functions with the help of applications, also known as apps. There is limited research on mobile application usage for healthcare delivery and health promotion. Purpose: This study evaluates the users’ perception of individuals using m-health apps to identify the reasons for using m-health apps, barriers preventing m-health adoption, and the type of rewards provided by application developers to encourage users. Additionally, this study tests the hypothesis model to assess the effects of social media influence, performance expectancy, and price on behavioral intentions to adopt m-health apps. Methodology: The study is descriptive and cross-sectional. Responses are collected from 192 m-health users selected with the help of a purposive sampling technique. Descriptive and frequency analysis was done with the help of Microsoft Excel 2016. Path analysis and hypothesis testing were done with the help of IBM SPSS V. 25 and Hayes Process Macro 3.5. Results: Primary reasons for using m-health apps included intentions to improve fitness (70.5%), followed by yoga and meditation (25.9%) and teleconsultation (23.2%). The top two barriers hindering the adoption of the m-health app were accuracy concerns (34%) and cost (21%). The variables influencing m-health selection decision include app reviews (40.5%) and ratings (28.8%). It was found that price dampens the relationship between social media influence and performance expectancy with β=−0.25, LLCI=−0.48, ULCI=−0.013, P=0.03. Practical Implications: M-health app developers and sellers should focus on improving the accuracy of the m-health apps in tracking fitness-related indicators; similarly, to increase the number of users, m-health developers should keep the prices reasonably low to enable interested users get m-health app user experience, scoring high on social media influence and having high-performance expectations. Additionally, m-health app developers should encourage satisfied users to give positive reviews and higher ratings at all sales points. Conclusions: M-health users primarily expect fitness improvement and facilitation in yoga and meditation with calorie monitoring from m-health usage. Social media influence and performance expectancy significantly affect behavioral intentions to use m-health apps. M-health app developers need to keep the prices reasonably low.}

The battle that was fought by institutions and their faculty members to move classes and programs from a face-to-face environment to an online one has resulted in a new set of challenges for them to overcome. In the context of online education, academics working in less developed countries are confronted with quite different realities than their peers working in more developed economies. This article investigates the effect that COVID-19 had on the higher education systems of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, three of the most important SAARC nations at a time when these countries were struggling with limited resources, unreliable infrastructure, and a pronounced “digital divide” in higher education. The literature review and in-depth interviews conducted for the purpose of this study uncovered six primary challenges. These challenges were identified as facilitating conditions, technology readiness, learning experience, mental health, concerns regarding performance improvement and sustainability. The findings presented here highlight the necessity for more government intervention and investment in order to: firstly, improve the quality of teaching and learning; and secondly, close the digital divide. Several recommendations are stated in this paper for future research to consider.}

The implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), a technology that allows replicating human actions in existing systems, given its benefits, can play an important role in achieving this goal, often referred as the digital transformation of organizations. However, the benefits of RPA implementation may not be perceived equally by managers, those responsible or that required its implementation, and lower-level employees. The work described in this paper aims not only to assess the perception that both groups have of the impacts of technology, but also to understand whether the use of robots by the employees of a shared services company positively influences their perception of the technology and whether it affects developments in additional robots in the future. A questionnaire, underpinned in a multidimensional evaluation model of the technology and given to all the company's employees, is used as the main research instrument, while results are analysed and interpreted using descriptive statistical techniques and hypothesis testing. We argue that this study may be an important contribution to the company for a better understanding of its employees' perception of RPA, allowing the tailoring of its future communication strategies to facilitate the acceptance of the technology and, thus, enhance the success and effectiveness of its implementation. Furthermore, the multidimensional evaluation model developed enhances the existing literature on the topic of RPA impacts, more specifically in terms of evaluating possible differences in perceptions between managers and other employees.}

Nevertheless, misalignment among digital initiative and existing operational routines are found in some companies, making the effectiveness of process digitalization initiative (PDI) uncertain. This research empirically investigates the effect of PDI on firm performance. Taking the perspective of dynamic operational capability, this study considers three key organizational factors, i.e., differentiation strategy, absorptive capability and lean production mechanism, that can facilitate firms to align their existing operational processes with digital technology and examine how they affect the implementation of PDI. We employ the long-horizon event study approach using the panel data collected from 168 firms adopting PDI in China during the period between 2006 and 2018. The findings of this study demonstrate that PDI implementation enhances firm performance. The results also show that differentiation strategy and absorptive capacity can enhance the effect of PDI implementation, but lean production has a substitution role in the effect of PDI. This research contributes to the literature on digital transformation and dynamic capability by investigating the actual effects of PDI implementation and exploring the key elements for its success from a novel perspective (i.e., dynamic capability development). This research also provides practical guidelines to enterprises how to conduct effective process digitalization and valuable insights to governments how to support enterprises for digitalization.}

abstract = {The current planetary crisis and the perceived urgency necessitates more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Businesses, particularly the multinationals, play a key role in transitioning to a circular economy, which provides a promising approach to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Industry 4.0 technologies can theoretically support this transition and enable circular economy through, for example, data-driven and smart business processes. However, merging these new technologies with a circular economy is not a straightforward and well-established process and it fundamentally changes the business value chain. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic overview to help better understand the transition process to circular business models and the enabling role of industry 4.0. Merging these concepts underlines that many factors are interrelated and should be investigated in a holistic way instead of siloes. The findings imply that changes transcend business boundaries, including new value chain characteristics and operation models and indicate the interconnected nature of certain factors along the product lifecycle, including service-based models, circular design, reverse flows, consumers and users, and collaborations. This paper proposes a conceptual transition framework to address how new circular business models can integrate digitally adaptive transformations and proposals for future research are reflected upon.}

Building on organizational adaptation theory and institutional theory, this study examines the impact of digital technology usage on business model innovation, the mediating role of strategic flexibility, and the moderating role of the institutional environment, including policy support and regulatory turbulence. The results based on a sample of 236 traditional manufacturing firms show that there is a significant association between digital technology usage and business model innovation in which strategic flexibility plays a mediating role. The institutional environment has a dual role in this association: policy support strengthens the impact of digital technology usage on strategic flexibility, but regulatory turbulence weakens it. The findings enrich the existing research on the mechanisms and boundary conditions of digitally driven business model innovation and support manufacturing business model innovation in the digital context.}

However, extensive use of organizational ICTs presents the potential for employee monitoring, control, and surveillance, which could be viewed adversely by employees leading to negative outcomes. Motivated by this dilemma about the mixed influence of organizational ICTs on employee outcomes, we first draw upon the literature on spatial intrusion to identify the two dimensions of employee technological spatial intrusion (TSI) — employee accessibility and employee visibility. Next, taking a locus of causality perspective, we examine the mechanisms through which the two dimensions of TSI impact ICT enabled employee innovation. Our research suggests that TSI may advance or inhibit employee innovation depending on the interactional meaning that the employees attach to the experienced intrusions. We test the proposed research model via a survey of 163 employees from diverse organizations who regularly use ICTs for their work. Results indicate that employee accessibility generally has positive, while employee visibility has negative relationships with employee innovation. Further, we demonstrate that ‘ICT usefulness perceptions’ mediate the relationships between accessibility and ICT-enabled innovation. Our research is among the first to conceptualize TSI and theorize its impact on employee innovation. Demonstrating the positive and negative influence of TSI may help organizations to design technologies that are perceived as more useful by employees. Together, the results from our study have implications for undertaking technological assessments for facilitating employee innovation.}

We draw on the organizational sense making literature to identify the organizational enablers of circular supply chains and their relationships with the environmental performance of supply chains. Data was collected from various supply chains within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was adopted to test the hypothesis derived from a systematic review of the literature. Originality of this work stems from the conceptualisation and validation of a framework for circular supply chains and sustainable performance as a combination of process facilitators and a persuasive organizational narrative that enables organizations to embrace the circular economy practices. The validated framework has implications for both academia and the industry because of its emphasis on the joint effects of a) the discursive ability of organizational actors to articulate a paradigm shift towards circular supply chains b) the process facilitators comprising of actions and practices that enable circular supply chains.}

abstract = {Over the past years, Malang (Indonesia) has encountered environmental problems due to municipal solid waste (MSW) overgeneration. Nevertheless, the increasing volume and complexity of MSW management in the city could be tackled using digital solutions. As a key location of ICT development, China is a key partner for Indonesia to improve its MSW management using digital technologies. As a miniature of China's sustainable waste management, Nanning represents a model of smart city that applies resource recovery paradigms using digitalization. Using a case-study approach, this work critically investigates how to strengthen waste recycling industry in Malang using digitalization-based circular economy (CE) according to Nanning's experiences in digitalizing waste recycling. It was found that lessons learnt from Nanning in MSW management were transferable and applicable for Malang to replicate its model, while paving the way forward for a transition towards a CE in waste sector. Traditionally, waste segregation at source was not properly conducted in Malang due to lack of environmental awareness and less public participation, while the waste management in Nanning is time-efficient and cost-effective. Nanning's experiences in digitalizing recyclable materials and/or recycled goods could facilitate Malang to shift towards a digitalization-based CE. Integrating automatic segregation and digitalization at waste banks is efficient in terms of time. With digitalization, over 90% of the solid waste in Malang is segregated properly, while diverting 60% of its non-biodegradable trash from landfills. Overall, the use of digital technologies has enabled waste banks to revolutionize waste industry, while promoting sustainable development at local level. To contribute their share to the UN SDGs, other cities in Indonesia are at their transition towards a digitalization-based CE. There is still a long way for them to attain full circularity and reap the benefits of digital transformation in the waste sector. Hence, it is necessary for stakeholders to promulgate effective policies and strengthen CE implementation on non-biodegradable waste through digital technologies.}

Expectations regarding the opportunities that Industry 4.0 offers for sustainable manufacturing are significantly high, but the lack of accurate understanding of the process through which Industry 4.0 technologies enable sustainable manufacturing is a fundamental barrier for businesses pursuing digitalization and sustainable thinking. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a roadmap that explains how Industry 4.0 and the underlying digital technologies can be leveraged to support and facilitate the triple bottom line of sustainable manufacturing. To this purpose, the study conducted a systematic literature review and identified 15 sustainability functions through which Industry 4.0 contributes to sustainable manufacturing. Interpretive structural modeling was further applied to identify the relationships that may exist within the sustainability functions. The resulting sustainable manufacturing roadmap explains how, and in which order, various Industry 4.0 sustainability functions contribute to developing the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. The resulting implications are expected to serve manufacturers, industrialists, and academia as a strategic guide for leveraging Industry 4.0 digital transformation to support sustainable development.}

Additionally, they have the potential to become the foundation of sustainable economic growth if given the right tools and support. In order to stay competitive, SMEs have to adapt permanently both in products and production. Approaches related to the vision of Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) and Smart Factories can help SMEs to address these challenges. The use cases, implementation examples and recommendations of the “Plattform Industrie 4.0” provide a basis for these approaches. However, the success of these approaches will depend on whether or not SMEs will adopt and implement them. Nevertheless, the barriers for adopting I4.0 approaches and technologies are still high. Specialized research institutions in Germany – so-called I4.0 test environments – have a broad infrastructure for developing and testing I4.0-relevant technologies, such as production machines and equipment or ICT testing facilities. This paper introduces an approach to facilitate the collaboration between SMEs and I4.0 test environments for creating new smart products enabled by I4.0 technologies. The overarching aim is enhancing business growth for manufacturing SMEs. Key aspects of this approach are: a) A competence-based matching mechanism implemented in an online platform, b) A funding scheme provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and c) Initiating, planning, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for funded SME projects. This approach will allow the rapid and targeted development of innovative Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and innovative smart products. In addition, this approach enables the cooperation between various I4.0 test environments and the continuous improvement of their offerings to manufacturing SMEs.}

COVID-19 impacted social-distancing measures forced an abrupt switch to online learning in most universities, putting immense pressure on the students to creatively adapt to new ways of online learning. Despite the purported positives of online learning, in the COVID-19 scenario, students reported mixed outcomes. While some students could adapt to the ‘new normal’, others struggled to adjust to the transformed IT-enabled learning scenario. Grounding our work in IT mindfulness literature, we posit that an IT-enabled learning environment may have differential impact on students’ productivity- and creativity-in-learning, depending on the extent of their IT mindfulness. Besides leveraging the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, we hypothesize the mediating role of techno eustress in the relationship between student IT mindfulness and learning effectiveness. We test the theorized model through data collected via a two-wave survey in a university student population exclusively using IT-enabled learning environments during the pandemic lockdown period. Results indicate that IT mindfulness has significant positive relationships with both productivity- and creativity-in- learning. Moreover, these relationships are mediated by the students’ techno eustress perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications arising from our study are also discussed.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determining factors of the high levels of NEETs both in EU member states and in partner countries, to support policy steering and increase socio-economic cohesion. The use of longitudinal data (2005–2020) from Eurostat and World Bank databases and selected and the testing of a number of 19 factors likely to influence the rate of NEETs show us that the effectiveness of public policy solutions focused on this category of population increases when complex factors and not singular elements are targeted. From a methodological point of view, we will use MARS models and fixed effects panel models. To account for countries’ heterogeneity, these models are applied to homogeneous groups of countries, identified through cluster analysis. Social cohesion and sustainability measures for policy steering have higher chances if the action of the responsible institutions targets both meso and macro levels, if it acts not only on a factor but also on the causes that favor its manifestation. Our analysis demonstrated that the measures aimed at increasing the chances of NEETs in order to facilitate their access to education, the labor market, and social inclusion must be coordinated with those of support for combating poverty and any type of exclusion, the support given to employers (subsidizing jobs, for example), the family and the community to which the young person belongs or local authorities. Also, the research results show us that there are more common elements between countries when we analyze the factors likely to increase the rate of NEETs than when we focus on their analysis by geographical criteria, based on EU membership status or EU partner status, etc.}

abstract = {The concept of the 4th industrial revolution is becoming a strategic determinant of sustainability, success and competitiveness in the modern mining sector. The importance of digital transformation in the mining industry has long been debated, hampered in part by the conservative nature of the mining sector. Much of the debate has focused on choosing suitable mining techniques that provide acceptable levels of ore/waste selectivity, the scale of implementation, cost reduction and suitable metallurgical extraction techniques. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the digital transformation of the minerals and extractive industry with a focus towards energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. We address: (a) geological elements that influence the level of selectivity during mining, and technologies that deal with waste rejection; (b) eco-friendly techniques, such as tunnel-boring machines, or the use of non-explosive techniques that can assist fragmentation of ores, thereby decreasing energy requirements during mineral processing and improving mineral recovery; (c) use of low-water-consumption automated ore-waste sorting systems; (d) selective metal leaching using coarse particle percolation as an alternate method for treating complicated low-grade ores; and (e) assessing new technological boundaries for the mineral sector. A combination of these aforementioned processes will significantly reduce mining waste. Orebody features, mining methods and equipment, desired scales of implementation, alignment with circular strategies, ore extraction efficiency, and socio-economic factors all play a role in the development and implementation of new technologies and techniques.}

Traffic monitoring and control at major airports is facilitated by the Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS).

This paper provides statistics for airport accidents caused by overland traffic safety violations. We highlight the factors related to the overland vehicle drivers’ traffic safety violations and list the airport environment factors that may endanger drivers. We also provide a rationale for a cognitive approach to dynamic situation analysis, aimed at predicting driver violations and based on cognitive analysis within the Decision Support System (DSS) algorithm. We design a functional DSS model that can be used to control overland traffic safety at major airports, and elaborate on the sources of data for the predictive algorithm.}

The need for supporting companies in this transformation is currently covered by several maturity models, generally operationalized through standardized questionnaires, which provide, as an outcome, an assessment of the current maturity stage and a set of general improvement recommendations according to it. However, to provide companies with a more tangible support, there is a need for more individual approach. In order to deal with this need, this paper proposes, following a design science research framework, a novel approach based on Problem-Based Learning for structuring the assessment procedure as a dialectic process. This approach aims at facilitating the contextualization of the assessed company and, consequently, the identification of context-specific improvement recommendations. The proposed approach, supported by a maturity model used for framing information collected during the assessment process, is tested in three industrial cases. Although these have been assessed at the same maturity stage, different improvement recommendations have been proposed according to contextual factors such as strategic goals, core processes and key performance indicators.}

Enabled by artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain technology, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and the Internet of Things, this digital transformation is creating a paradigm shift in how we manage our GW resources. The next generation GW management tools are emerging with web-based GW management platforms following FAIR Data Principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. These web-based platforms can improve participation, cooperation, and collective action, and enable alternative forms of GW management such as commons-based peer management of GW resources. These web-based platforms not only provide comprehensive and timely information about the GW system with simulation and gaming tools, but also enable agents to work cooperatively. In this chapter, we discuss GW sustainability in a digital world using examples from both developing and developed countries. We show how these web-based platforms can provide historical and future-scenario information for strategic planning and development, and real-time information for daily decision-making. These web-based platforms can additionally facilitate cooperation among GW users through a blockchain-based system for GW credit, GW trading, and GW policy incentives, as an example. Furthermore, these we-based platforms do not only inform on GW systems, but also can be useful for other smart technologies such as smart agriculture, and smart city. Insights regarding the prospects of digital GW and the anticipated transformation of GW management practices are important for researchers, GW regulators, GW managers, GW users, and technology providers to plan for tomorrow.}

This paper builds on dynamic managerial capabilities theory to argue that managerial human capital—composed of leadership and entrepreneurial skills—is a critical facilitator of DBMT and resultant firm performance. Further, the research model proposes that managers' social capital and cognition positively moderate the relationship between human capital and DBMT. The study's findings from a sample of German Industry 4.0 firms provide new insights into the significance of managerial capabilities in a digital economy. This study advances management literature by demonstrating that the benefits of managers' human capital for DBMT are contingent on its form: entrepreneurial skills facilitate digital transformation integral for firm performance, while leadership skills have no impact on firm performance—neither directly nor indirectly through DBMT. Thus, this study provides strong evidence of the importance of entrepreneurial skills in driving DBMT to increase firm performance. Further, the findings offer a nuanced account of the interrelationships between dynamic managerial capabilities, revealing that higher levels of social capital and lower levels of cognition increase the positive effect of entrepreneurial skills on DBMT. This study altogether reaffirms the significance of managers' dynamic capabilities for strategic change enabled by DBMT and their performance benefits, yet it reveals that the effect mechanisms differ from those found in nondigital research settings.}

abstract = {Digital traceability (DT), as an important application of technology in the supply chain visibility field under digital transformation in manufacturing, is critical for food producers to guarantee food safety. The success of DT requires closer collaboration among all supply chain members. A big challenge for food producers is that most supply chain members show a disinclination to participate in DT initiatives. The involvement of participants through effective governance approaches oriented around the supply chain—either via formal contracts or informal relational governance—is therefore needed. Unfortunately, the way in which food producers can facilitate the success of DT through such governances is still unclear and lacks sufficient studies. Drawing upon the transaction cost theory and relational exchange theory, this study develops a conceptual model assuming that the contractual governance food producers adopt over their supply chain members can promote the success of DT, and the relationship between contractual governance and DT success is contingent on relational governance. The hierarchical regression method is employed to test hypotheses based on survey responses from 280 Chinese food producers in four provinces with national demonstration projects for the digital technology-enabled traceability system. The statistical results demonstrate that contractual governance has an inverse-U curvilinear effect (from positive to negative) on DT success. Moreover, relational governance moderates the impact of contractual governance on DT success. Specifically, a high level of relational governance mitigates the negative impact of contractual governance, and the joint use of relational governance and contractual governance could facilitate successful DT—but only in cases with higher relational governance. This study contributes to the literature by applying two theories to reveal how food producers can drive DT success through the adoption of governance approaches. It also provides useful managerial implications for food producers to effectively employ both types of governances over their supply chain members to achieve large-scale successful DT.}

To this end, Higher Education institutions reacted rather vastly to this unpreceded situation although many issues have been reported in the international literature since the emergence of the first global lockdown. As we are now transitioning back to the ‘normality’, universities and businesses consider the so-called ‘blended’ or ‘hybrid’ model as a means of facilitating the transition phase. In view of this decision, several studies can be identified wherein blended learning scenarios are proposed and described. The present work constitutes such an effort. Precisely, while adjusting the lens to the didactic of Robotics courses, we propose a blended learning model via which the laboratory activities are performed without the physical presence of the students in the physical context. The aforementioned objective is attained under the aid of the Virtual Reality technology coupled with the Digital Twin model. We hope that the ideas presented in this manuscript will motivate and inspire more researchers, instructional designers, and educators to consider the adoption of such alternative instructional techniques to mitigate the shortcomings that the remote education setting brings and further to improve the overall learning experience.}

In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period. A conceptual model was created by combining the diamond framework, the technology enactment framework, and enterprise architecture scope to facilitate the chronological analysis of these events and reflect upon the creation of flexibility. The findings indicate that DT in government spreads in waves with adaptations in different organizational elements, impacting the whole administrative system from the provincial level to the country level and including both radical and incremental changes. Flexibility increases alongside progress in DT and can be technology-enabled or policy-enabled. The creation of flexibility also depends on organizational elements and bureaucratic levels. This study advocates a cross-level view to comprehensively understand DT and offers insights to help other governments craft DT agenda.}

Thus, a twin transition is in motion facilitated by the New Industrial Strategy supporting the adoption of green business strategies across industrial ecosystems. This paper investigates whether the digital transformation and the decision to participate in public procurement as a transparent external funding source support adoption of business actions fostering sustainability transition. Data over more than 20,000 SMEs in the EU-28 over the period 2015–2019 complemented by country-specific attributes towards sustainability and institutional business environment are combined. Econometric results indicate that digital transformation fosters sustainability transition. Although participation in public tenders exerts a positive and systematic effect on the adoption of a sustainability supporting strategy, the two decisions appear independent indicating that SMEs are determined to shift the production paradigm irrespectively. Business operational problems affect but not deter sustainability transition. Business corruption in countries of low levels of sustainability impedes sustainable business actions, yet evidence favors higher transparency. The latter highlights the necessity towards building a coherent although adaptable institutional framework. This study contributes to SDGs 7, 12, 13 and 16.}

This research was conducted using a survey on a stratified random sample and the data was subsequently analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, and eta-coefficient. Multivariate analysis was applied to data obtained from 172 companies. The results showed that a number of factors determine the ways in which companies apply digital marketing and use differing levels of influence, amongst which the period of implementation, the abilities of people in charge for its usage, perception of digital marketing cost-effectiveness, measurability of its effects and sufficiency of traditional marketing have a key role. The period in which digital marketing is used was especially significant and notably affects the choice of digital marketing instruments, the way its performances are measured and the managers’ perception of its cost-effectiveness. Social networks were the most commonly used form of digital marketing in the market under analysis, and Google analytics was the most common way to measure the effects of digital marketing. Furthermore, the results showed that the more a company relies on the use of digital marketing in its business, the more significant its impact on promotion and brand positioning.}

Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

In this research we explore what are the key factors in the creation of collaborative networks between teachers. As a case study, we focus on the first steps of building a network of schools to promote digital education in Cantabria (northern Spain). With the participation of 11 schools, we conducted 22 interviews and 2 focus groups to analyze the learning environments of the teaching staff, the personal collaboration networks in the professional field, and the factors perceived as relevant in the design of the digital action plan of each school. The results showed the existence of teachers in each school who were pioneers in the digitization process and who acted as intermediaries both with the public educational administration and with teachers from other schools. During the interviews with these pioneers, we evaluated their personal networks as well as the factors they deem significant for an effective digital transformation. The results were contrasted in a public forum in which 120 teachers participated. Based on these results, we discuss how the creation of a network of key actors could contribute in developing the digital capacity of schools in the region.}

abstract = {This study's primary objective is to assess the impact of a city's sustainability index on the production of green electricity within a selection of 30 Chinese cities spanning the timeframe from 2000 to 2020. The findings unequivocally demonstrate that cities with a strong commitment to sustainability exhibit a marked propensity for expanding their sustainable electricity generation infrastructure. Moreover, the research underscores the pivotal role played by the development of information and communication technology in facilitating sustainable electricity production across these Chinese urban centers. Conversely, variables such as population growth, industrialization, tourism appeal, and poverty rates emerge as significant hindrances to the advancement of sustainable electricity generation in these cities. The implications gleaned from these findings point to a range of actionable policies, including the cultivation of green financial markets within sustainable cities, the digital transformation of urban landscapes, the expansion of ecotourism initiatives, and the implementation of poverty alleviation strategies in the remote regions of China.}

However, how DT contributes to ETI remains unclear in both literature and practice. Recognizing their importance in ultimately sustaining enterprises' competitiveness, in this study we explore the nexus and mechanism between enterprise DT and ETI. In our research methodology, the data collected pertains to 1747 enterprises listed in A-shares from 2011 to 2019. We develop both static and dynamic benchmark regression models and a moderation effect model to test the relationships between DT and ETI. In addition, to address the endogeneity issue in model application, we introduce exogenous instrumental variables and adopt the generalized method of moment and a two-stage least square method. Our findings highlight that DT has not only a positive impact on ETI but also a heterogeneous effect on ETI in the types of enterprise ownerships and bias of energy technology progress. Moreover, it affects ETI mainly through total agency costs, financial technology, and research and development investment. Based on the findings, we offer policy recommendations for the coordination of digital economy and energy transition, providing guidance for developing countries. For example, digital platforms are recommended to be implemented at both the enterprise and national levels, in attempting to facilitate the development of digital economy and smart energy.}

abstract = {Smart Farming Technologies (SFT) are smart devices part of a cyber-physical system able to improve farm management. Compared to other digital technologies' functionalities, SFT generate a multitude of data that once combined can be used not only on-farm but across the entire supply chain. Although recent studies highlighted how the lack of users’ resources and competences might hinder the diffusion of digital agriculture technologies overall, few studies so far focused specifically on SFT. Moreover, the extant literature interprets the adoption decision mostly as “one-off binary” process, and limited attention is given to individual aspects of users and farms. Therefore, this study investigates the adoption of SFT analyzing various aspects of its complex nature; on the one hand, the analysis considers the multi-step nature of the adoption decision process: first, intention formation and then, actual adoption decision. On the other hand, the SFT adoption process is interpreted as being determined by several typologies of determinants beyond the most studied ones, with a particular focus on the role that organizational conditions and the supply chain governance structure play in influencing farmers' adoption of SFT. An empirical analysis is run on a sample of 474 responses, collected through an on-line survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and a Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression (ZIP) were used to investigate respectively the intention to use and the actual adoption of SFT. Results show that farmers' intention to use mainly relies on technologies' performance expectancy, technologies' complexity and social influence exerted on farmers, while organizational supporting conditions do not play a significant effect. Nonetheless, when the actual adoption decision is observed, the likelihood that non-adopters intend to adopt SFT in their farms increases when formal integration along the supply chain is high and with the dimension of the farm (in terms of both land size and sales). When the adopters are analyzed instead, the decision to adopt is positively affected only by the individual intention to use and by farmers' specialization in the arable sector. Findings reveal what factors need to be considered to guarantee a fairer and more inclusive agricultural digitalization, such as the role of social influence exerted by some figures around farmers and the still weak facilitating organizational conditions.}

To test the model, the researchers obtained data from 375 undergrads. The study adopted the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach in AMOS software to examine the determinants that affect the users to embrace Fintech services. The findings revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly influence the students' intention to use Fintech, whereas, the users’ facilitating condition and behavioral purposes positively influence them to use the financial technology. Interestingly, the social influence and personal innovativeness did not affect their intention to accept and adopt Fintech. Therefore, the study results will help explore the expectations, preferences, and actual level of use of Fintech among undergraduates and contribute to the escalation of Fintech use, leading to sustainable financial inclusion.}

The study's sample covers the years between 2006 and 2017 and contains 1677 country-year observations. The results of fixed effect analysis indicate that the six proxies for governments’ long-term vision and the digitalization of government services all play a significant role in alleviating tax evasion. Moreover, ICT adoption by society and citizens positively moderates the association between the digitalization of government services and tax evasion; that is, the digitalization of government services has a stronger effect on mitigating tax evasion in countries where ICT adoption is higher. The study suggests several implications for leveraging ICT in public service delivery, which may help countries reduce tax evasion and increase tax revenue. Specifically, public authorities should improve e-government structures and e-filing systems to facilitate taxpayers’ income tax declarations and payments.}

We demonstrate that container shipping lines have developed a very strong focus on market shares and on the lowering of the cost base by ordering ultra large vessels and by focusing on horizontal integration. The increasing “commoditization” of the liner shipping market and low margins are urging shipping lines to consider other growth strategies and revenue models by focusing on supply chain integration/vertical integration, digital transformation and by aiming for zero emission ships. These transformation processes within container shipping lines are not easy, given the weak financial base of most companies.}

This study adopts an exploratory approach to improve existing understanding about the strategies that financial platforms implement. In addition, we explore what incumbents are doing to ‘survive’ and if the measures they are taking are sufficient to achieve survival. Further, we examine whether customer-focused strategies, such as Experience-Based Offerings (EBOs), provide the best solution for financial service firms to gain competitive advantage. The findings show that strategies can be implemented successfully by integrating technology to improve, personalize, and customize customer experiences, while managers and employees can add quality to experiences. This study contributes to our understanding of business platforms by identifying how they are designed and managed, and how incumbents can learn from them to respond to the challenges presented by today’s rapidly changing consumer behavior.

Manufacturing is no exception. However, Smart Manufacturing, the digital practice, organization, workforce, and infrastructure transformation for collection and deployment of data and models at scale and at all levels of manufacturing, is a complex, costly, and labor-intensive journey that is still seeing slow adoption. The Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), a national Manufacturing USA public-private partnership sponsored by the Department of Energy, is addressing this scaled use of data and modeling in manufacturing. CESMII has focused on how to collect and use operating data for numerous applications that improve productivity, precision, and performance of manufacturing operations from factory floor to supply chain using process simulation, predictive analytics, monitoring and control, and real-time optimization. Because contextualized data are key, CESMII has developed the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform (SMIP) to lower the barriers to the data that are needed to accelerate data-based model building, improve data visualization, and more quickly gain insights. Reusable, standards-based ways of doing data collection, ingestion, and contextualization are particularly important for scaling access and use of data. The SMIP uses a standards-based definition and construct for reusable information models called an SM Profile. When an SM Profile is used in conjunction with the SMIP, the SMIP ensures the availability of contextualized, operational data for model building. The present work demonstrates Smart Manufacturing and the application of the SMIP for building several data-centered models for the operation and control of an experimental electrochemical reactor that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to valuable liquid and gas chemicals, such as alcohols, olefins, and syngas. We describe how the SMIP plays a central role in more effective model building and we demonstrate how the electochemical reactor can be controlled and optimized for the desired products. Use of the SMIP involves the transmission of real-time sensor measurements to a cloud resource so that the operating data are available to all model building experts. The data collection and transmission process is fully automated to greatly reduce the need for manual manipulation of the data. Data-driven machine learning models are used for advanced real-time state estimation, real-time optimization, and model-based feedback control for the reactor. The application models are implemented as a system to monitor the data flow and control the electrochemical reactor with a single visualization interface. SM Profiles are used to demonstrate reusability of the information models for the reactor and the instrumentation. The application packages, algorithms, and user interfaces developed are cast as Docker images in a library to facilitate reusability of the application models.}

abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to investigate the current status of the workplace, its evolution during COVID-19, and the impact of the pandemic on the new (next) normal. This follows previous research about changes in the workplace influenced by the pandemic. Documents, publications, and surveys from numerous sources have been analysed to discover more about the experience of employees and organizations with remote working and the advantages and disadvantages of accessing the workplace during the pandemic and in the new (next) normal. The paper has two objectives, the first of which is to explore some indicators based on available data sources that can help to understand and, in some way, measure the workplace changes in the context of COVID-19. The second is to extend the previous analysis, using the same timeline framework, by studying the workplace during and after COVID-19.
Structure
First, the introduction explains the main basis of the research and the principal data sources, outlining what is known, what is new, and the aim of the paper. Then the research methodology is explained, along with the criteria by which the datasets were selected, and the results for the indicators outcomes. Finally, the concluding section highlights the findings obtained, their implications, the limitations of the study, and suggested future lines of research.
Findings
The analysis provides insight into to employees' and organizations' experience with remote working and the advantages and disadvantages of accessing the workplace during the pandemic. The indicators identified can allow a better understanding of the environment and, especially, a deeper knowledge of the new normal situation under COVID-19.
Discussion
In previous studies, certain strategic categories were identified in the process of reimagining the workplace after COVID-19. Those strategic categories supported the conclusion that there were several common company policies which, translated into practical action, could help in people's engagement with their work. These policies can be summarized as redesigning the physical space of the workplace, work flexibility, family reconciliation, and health security. The study of these policies, based on data analysis, may open up different research paths and allow us to establish models directly related to employee satisfaction.
Originality
The paper continues a previous line of research on the situation in the workplace by incorporating certain indicators that allow its measurement and, above all, its evolution over time, especially during the time of the new (next) normal, and by investigating the current status and future evolution of the workplace in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the data made possible the identification of patterns within the available literature regarding recent events and, especially, their influence on the workplace. This has led to the development of indicators in a range of categories.
Practical implications
The revolution initiated by COVID-19 has changed the way companies and employees work, which has involved a constant reinvention of the way they operate and provoked previously unseen actions and profound changes in the workplace. Therefore, the idea of the workplace will never again be what it was expected to be was before COVID-19, and it will be very different from that in the new (next) normal. The strategic categories and their indicators developed here are considered important for people's engagement with their workplaces and organizations. The processes adopted by firms must facilitate the redesign of the workplace in accordance with the new forms of work and not act as a mere copy or transfer of the usual approaches to remote work. Providing answers to the questions involved, and deepening the classifications of the categories we develop, can help us understand how people can be connected with the newest forms of workplaces. Some categories and their associated indicators are relevant in remote work and home office environments created by COVID-19. Given that the research started within a pandemic that has not yet ended, while we now know a lot more, the near-term future is uncertain.}

Four developed hypotheses were tested using the regression analysis to find the relationship between digital business strategy, sustainability strategy and financial performance.

One key issue faced by port authorities is to identify ships of higher risk accurately. This study aims to address the ship selection issue by first developing two data-driven ship risk prediction frameworks using features the same as or derived from the current ship selection scheme. Both frameworks are empirically shown to be more efficient than the current ship selection method. Like existing ship risk prediction models, the proposed frameworks are of black-box nature whose working mechanism is opaque. To improve model explainability, local explanation of the prediction of individual ships by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is provided. Furthermore, we innovatively extend the local SHAP model to a near linear-form global surrogate model which is fully-explainable. This demonstrates that the behavior of black-box data-driven models can be as interpretable as white-box models while retaining their prediction accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the white-box global surrogate models can accurately show the behavior of the original black-box models, shedding light on model validation, fairness verification, and prediction explanation. This study makes the very first attempt in the maritime transport area to quantitatively explain the rationale of black-box prediction models from both local and global perspectives, which facilitates the application of data-driven models and promotes the digital transformation of the traditional shipping industry.}

While these represent initial benefits from the digitalization of the process, a recurring evaluation and optimization of the process are required to sustain and improve process efficiency. For both non-digitalized and digitalized processes, the challenges for process owners are comparable. However, for digitalized processes, convenient tools facilitate process modifications. Particularly no-code digitalized processes exploit the opportunity for quick and agile process adaption with low efforts but require a structured and systematic method to ensure a quality-driven approach. This paper conceptualizes a rule-based decision support model for process improvement that takes advantage of digital traces recorded during process execution of digitalized processes. On the one hand, process mining techniques support data analysis and assist the extraction of process performance indicators as precursors to predict low process performance. On the other hand, process experts compile a list of recommendations for action in workshops and interviews to counteract low process efficiency. The approach to rule-based decision support developed in the scope of this research merges these two dimensions and constitutes an assistive tool for the continuous improvement of digitalized processes. Initial results of the model in practical application support this assessment and demonstrate further research needs.}

Singapore’s urban built environment has become more complex with increased multilevel land use below and above the ground. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) maps are, therefore, increasingly inadequate to support effective management of the city. To address the issue, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) leads a whole-of-government (WHOG) initiative to create and maintain a geometrically accurate three-dimensional (3D) national topographic map and high-quality 3D datasets that capture fundamental as-built 3D information of buildings, terrain, and roads. These datasets serve as the authoritative base map which can be shared across government agencies to satisfy the increasing needs of government and agencies in smart operation, development planning, policymaking, and risk management. This chapter introduces the technological innovations that have been adopted to make changes in multiagency collaboration, as well as making a difference in the city experience of Singapore for social innovation. As a case study, the chapter explores the drivers, actors, and innovative aspects of developing a web-based geospatial platform integrating different 2D and 3D data and models. The platform integrates an intelligent environment decision support system (IEDSS) and a quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST) to facilitate citizen-based and multiagency collaboration in urban planning, design, and resource allocation.}

Business operations are undergoing drastic changes due to the disruptive effects of technology innovations; however, there is insufficient knowledge regarding the acceptability and consequences of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) in the education sector. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study explores the readiness of the education sector for 4IR. We adopted face-to-face semi-structured interviews to explore the views of 33 key stakeholders in the education sector, to understand the readiness and acceptability of 4IR in the sector. Findings show that the education sector, especially in Africa, is unprepared for 4IR, although there are indications for opportunities to harness the potential of the much-anticipated 4IR. Moreover, our study demonstrates a mutual symbiotic relationship between the education sector and technology innovations. The findings show that 4IR can facilitate students’ learning experience and transforms the workplace, although there is a need to assess the learning environment, to understand the facilitators and barriers to 4IR diffusion. The findings indicate the opportunity for the education sector to harness the innovations associated with 4IR through research and teaching to enhance learners’ experience; however, this may require a significant improvement in education curricula, as well as investments. The findings contribute to the theory and practice of technology in education and the limited literature on 4IR in the education sector, particularly in Africa.}

But understanding the determinants of mHealth apps adoption remains unclear. Comparatively less attention has been given to the factors affecting the adoption of mHealth apps among the young generation. This study aims to examine the factors influencing behavioral intention and actual usage behavior of mHealth apps among technology prone young generation. The research model has extracted variables from the widely accepted Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) alongside privacy, lifestyles, self-efficacy and trust. Required data were collected from mHealth apps users in Bangladesh. Firstly, this study confirmed that performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation and privacy exerted a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, trust and lifestyle had an influence on both behavioral intention and actual usage behavior. Secondly, the Neural Network Model was employed to rank relatively significant predictors obtained from structural equation modeling (SEM). This study contributes to the growing literature on the use of mHealth apps in trying to elevate the quality of patients' lives. The new methodology and findings from this study will significantly contribute to the extant literature of technology adoption and mHealth apps adoption intention especially. Therefore, for practitioners concerned with fostering mHealth apps adoption, the findings stress the importance of adopting an integrated approach centered on key findings of this study.}

Governments seek to employ disruptive technologies to substantially transform government-citizen relationships, enhance citizens’ experiences, transform public decision making, emphasize citizen engagement in the democratic decision-making process, provide more agile and resilient government structures, create substantial public value and generally improve quality of life. Despite its numerous potential advantages, smart government is still in its early phases of development. Examining issues related to the usage behavior of smart government services has received little attention. Outcomes of the usage of online technologies in general, and electronic public services in particular, have been largely overlooked. Accordingly, this study aims at developing and empirically validating an integrated model of smart government usage by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) through the incorporation of a set of determinants and outcomes of smart government usage following an extensive review of extant literature. The data were obtained from 414 smart government clients in the United Arab Emirates through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of this study indicated that, among all significant antecedents of smart government usage, performance expectancy has the strongest impact, whilst facilitating conditions has the weakest influence. It has been also reported that personalization has no significant effect on smart government usage. The results further revealed that the strongest impact of smart government usage is on information transparency. Implications for theory and practice are also offered.}

abstract = {Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic had a major effect on teaching and learning. This study aimed to describe a range of teaching, learning, and assessment strategies related to radiography education which have become more common due to the pandemic through a narrative literature review.
Key findings
Educational change in radiography was accelerated by the disruption caused by the pandemic. Changes included the site and mode of teaching and conducting of assessment. While some of the digital transformation trends were introduced before the pandemic, others were further amplified during this period of time. Alternative solutions such as virtual reality technology, gamification, and technology-enhanced learning were especially salient and have the potential to mitigate challenges brought about by the pandemic. The use of technology in the clinical setting, in assessment, and to facilitate feedback, are important tools for improving learners' clinical skills performance. Collectively, these digital technologies can maximise learning and support mastery of knowledge, skills and attitudes.
Conclusion
The pandemic has cast a new light on existing methodologies and pedagogies in education. This review suggests that digital technology is shaping teaching and learning within radiography education and also that educators cannot ignore this digital shift. With the digital trajectory, it would be highly useful to transform approaches to education within radiography to support learning as radiography education moves towards the new normal era.
Implications for practice
Digital technology in education can help improve the learning experience for learners but educators need to be equipped with the technological skills and be adaptable to these changes. Continual sharing of experiences and knowledge among radiography educators is essential. Safety nets need to be in place to ensure digital inclusiveness and that no learner gets left behind due to the digital divide in education.}

The last seventy years have been characterized by rapid advancements in computer technology, and the healthcare system has not been immune to this trend. However, anatomic pathology has remained largely an analog discipline. In recent years, this has been changing with the growing adoption of digital pathology, partly driven by the potential of computer-aided diagnosis. As part of an international collaboration, we conducted a comprehensive survey to gain a deeper understanding of the status of digital pathology implementation in Europe and Asia. A total of 127 anatomic pathology laboratories participated in the survey, including 75 from Europe and 52 from Asia, with 72 laboratories having established digital pathology workflow and 55 without digital pathology. Laboratories using digital pathology for diagnostic (n = 29) and non-diagnostic (n = 43) purposes were thoroughly questioned about their implementation strategies and institutional experiences, including details on equipment, storage, integration with laboratory information system, computer-aided diagnosis, and the costs of going digital. The impact of the digital pathology workflow was also evaluated, focusing on turnaround time, specimen traceability, quality control, and overall satisfaction. Laboratories without access to digital pathology were asked to provide insights into their perceptions of the technology, expectations, barriers to adoption, and potential facilitators. Our findings indicate that while digital pathology is still the future for many, it is already the present for some. This decade may be a time when anatomic pathology finally embraces the digital revolution on a large scale.}

However, IC is mainly used in a vehicle system to realize real-time quality inspection, while its further potential is not fully exerted in advanced construction control and management as a comprehensive, continuous and nondestructive testing tool. This paper proposes a BIM (Building Information Model)-IoT (Internet of things) and IC integrated framework to provide a fundamental platform for advanced compaction quality monitoring and management. Specifically, BIM provides high-fidelity virtual assets of road infrastructure for data integration, visualization and construction organization management. IC is used to provide comprehensive compaction quality monitoring data and quality control methods. IoT (Internet of things) is adopted to connect physical and cyber assets by capturing real-time data from the actual operations in construction. Finally, a prototype system is developed as an implementation of the framework. The case demonstration of the system shows that the proposed framework can effectively integrate BIM and IC to realize the monitoring of road compaction quality and data in combination with IoT data, and the construction schedule can be rearranged and optimized based on the monitoring results. This study can facilitate to realize road compaction quality real-time monitoring and management, as well to offer a basic BIM-IoT platform that can be utilized as a prototype of road infrastructure digital twin to achieve more intelligent and sustainable management of the entire construction process in the future.}

abstract = {Based on the rapid development of intelligent technologies in recent years, the digital transformation of the whole industry and society has become increasingly important. Among them, digital twins and artificial intelligence have great potentials in improving industry processes and further enhancing productivity. This paper proposes an Intelligent Digital Twin System (IDTS) based on artificial intelligence and digital twins for the paper industry. The system includes the prediction models for the stirring speed of the dump chest, the water consumption of the deflaker, the supply air pressure of the dryer, and the exhaust air temperature of the dryer. The sensors, 5G network slices, and other equipment collect related data during the papermaking process for generating twin data, and we use the prediction models to analyze the data and monitor important indicators (stirring speeds, water consumptions, supply air pressures, and exhaust air temperatures) for the manufacturing processes, which are used to improve the energy utilization and production efficiency of the paper industry and thus facilitate cost saving. We apply this intelligent digital twin system and its associated prediction models to an actual paper manufacturing factory and show their effectiveness by improving the operational efficiency and saving labor and maintenance costs.}

While it builds on previous Decision Theatre work, the new structuring into these three elements emphasizes what is needed for setting up a Decision Theatre for a given challenge. Based on experience with a specific example – sustainable mobility in Germany – it is argued that agent-based models are particularly suitable for Decision Theatres and that the method is useful not only for decision support but also for science communication and co-creation of a deeper knowledge of the system under discussion. As a step towards facilitating a broader use of the Decision Theatre Triangle method, the paper then sketches research needs for each of its three elements, with a focus on mathematical modelling and simulation.}

Previous research conducted on structured workplaces using traditional industrialist paradigms had established an ideal composition of employee traits. However, today's contrasting fast-paced environments may have made those profiles obsolete, prompting the need to identify a profile of personalities and interests that enables organizations to assemble a workforce high in digital self-efficacy, which fundamentally drives organizations’ agility. We proposed and evaluated such a model by conducting two studies at international (Study 1, N = 309) and French (Study 2, N = 1,025) publicly traded organizations. The results indicate the personality dimensions openness to experience and emotional stability and investigative and realistic vocational interests are predispositions for the development of digital self-efficacy. Furthermore, we found corroborative evidence for digital self-efficacy to facilitate workforce agility. These findings offer novel insights into those individual psychological traits that foster an agile workforce and make it well-equipped to face the challenges of rapidly changing digital business environments today and in the future.}

To enhance the efficiency and security of data transmission in cloud computing, this study proposes a quantum cloud office model and presents a novel quantum dialogue protocol particularly designed for this model. The proposed protocol enables authenticated communication among office correspondents. Leveraging the unique properties of multiple quantum degrees of freedom, this protocol expands the channel capacity and enhances transmission efficiency. Compared to previous measurement-device-independent quantum dialogue (MDI-QD) protocols, this protocol not only further improves transmission efficiency but also enables mutual authentication between correspondents, effectively defending against the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. The utilization of a cross-Kerr medium for Bell measurements offers a 50% increase in efficiency compared to linear optical equipment. This novel protocol is tailored to the data transmission process within the cloud office model, thereby enhancing the communication efficiency and reinforcing secure data transmission.}

Traditionally, the Geographic Information System (GIS) is the tool for storing, manipulating and analysing spatial and geographic data. However, recent developments in new methods and technologies are reshaping the methodologies and processes of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. Encouraged by the current regulatory system, an improvement in approach, leading from the traditional planning to a shared and highly integrated digital model, is now made possible by using the Building Information Modelling (BIM). The collaborative project environment, typical of BIM tools, could become an important key success factor, especially in a framework of interoperability with other systems, such as GIS. Focusing on the airfield, this study aims to evaluate the potentiality and benefits given by the implementation of airport facilities in the BIM system and their interaction with the surrounding area. The results reveal that GIS and BIM interoperability enables to achieve a broader and deeper understanding of the digital models in the larger territorial context, facilitating for instance the analysis of possible interferences with aircraft operations in the interaction between facilities and surroundings. Furthermore, having the airport facilities implemented in BIM system, an overall optimisation of the management, maintenance, control and monitoring processes, as well as a better quality and saving on time and costs, could be observed. For this purpose, the application of a case study in this research work confirms the validity related to the practical features of the proposed framework. In fact, investigating the main requirements and characteristics to be taken into account during the BIM-GIS interoperability processes, the present approach may constitute a support tool for better planning and management of airport facilities.}

With increasing dissemination, AM confronts logistics service providers (LSPs) with the question of how they should adapt their business model to the threats and opportunities that come with the emerging digital technologies. We structure the AM activities of LSPs and develop a deep understanding of their resulting business model dynamics. For this exploratory purpose, this study develops a taxonomy and performs a cluster analysis to present six clusters of how LSPs approach AM today. The six profiles include LSPs that reactively monitor AM or, in contrast, proactively leverage AM for their internal operations and the development of new services for their external customers. Among them, four profiles entail fundamental changes to the traditional business models of LSPs. We find that these LSPs oftentimes continue to rely on their traditional “analog” service strengths to offer integrated service bundles of AM and logistics solutions. They bridge their lack of specific resources by strategic alliances with AM experts. Only a few LSPs have started severing ties to their traditional businesses to develop digitally dominated, platform-based AM services that require different resources. Overall, the comprehensive picture of AM activities enables us to contribute to the knowledge of how LSPs navigate in the digital age and to the nexus of business model dynamics and emerging technologies. We propose a set of propositions and support practitioners in analyzing and designing AM activities.}

The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.}

One of the main safety pillars is offering passengers a reliable emergency evacuation plan. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has disseminated guidelines for passenger ships to enhance the evacuation process understanding. Although the number of passenger ships is rising worldwide, implementing IMO's guidelines, particularly advance evacuation analysis, is still a young research area. Hence, this paper attempts to study previous research on human evacuation from the IMO perspective to uncover the current position of the issued guidelines in the literature. Accordingly, this research reviews 115 research publications published in scientific journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and doctoral and master dissertations from January 1999 to August 2022. As a result, the authors present the literature review of state-of-the-art papers to establish a firm foundation of past research. After identifying gaps, breakthrough points are clarified for future research about the benefits of handling uncertainty in input parameters, understanding human evacuation behavior, mutual interrelation among evacuation factors, and potential adoption of digital technologies in human evacuation from passenger ships.}

abstract = {The rapid evolution of information technology is the driving force behind the ongoing digital transformation. Ubiquitous communication devices and digital services have become an essential part in most of our lives. Context-awareness enables convenient new forms of interaction and instant delivery of relevant information for a given situation. IT services that provide a benefit to the user based on their current position or the position of another entity, are known as location-based services (LBS). In the context of the ongoing digitization of the manufacturing industry, LBS have the potential to improve processes on the shop floor and in the office environment. Unlike in the B2C sector, however, LBS have not yet found a solid foothold in industrial environments due to a number of barriers hindering the implementation. The main barrier is the lack of a standard indoor positioning solution, which is required for an indoor localization. As a result, the implementation of indoor LBS requires a tailored system comprising an appropriate indoor positioning technology, computational infrastructure as well as compatible software solutions. During the specification phase, it is necessary to evaluate the initial situation and existing hardware and software infrastructure to develop the optimal solution for a given company. In this paper, we present a feature-based approach that uses a feature model to specify industrial LBS for different application categories like asset management, information provision, wayfinding, security and process analytics. For each application category, we have identified the possible LBS features that can be combined to create fitting LBS for the scenario at hand. The feature model facilitates the configuration of individual LBS, taking into account various prerequisites of a company. Furthermore, the feature model is linked to a technology morphology, which enables an accessible containment of the available technological solutions. We use the example use case “automatic tool configuration” to validate the specification approach using the feature model and the technology morphology.}

The results show that social influence, social facilitation experience, perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived enjoyment (PE) are all significantly linked to perceived usefulness (PU) of social media; however, FoMO is not. GOSIP, PU, and PE are positively related to attitude toward social media use, which is positively related to active social media behaviors.

These pressures necessitate a diversification of their business model, yet it remains uncertain how operators plan to adapt and how the government can facilitate the evolution of their mobility services. This study explores these issues from the viewpoint of small and medium-sized taxi firm operators in Japan, specifically focusing on their attitudes towards potential barriers, their preparedness for, and preferences towards new business models. To that end, we conducted a Statd Preference survey on new business models with taxi companies in the Chugoku region, western Japan. The findings reveal that an operator's attitude towards regulatory strictness indirectly lowers the likelihood of choosing new business models, whereas operational difficulties increase this probability. Interestingly, taxi firms operating in medium-sized cities tended to collaborate with private or public sectors in their new business models compared to firms in other areas. This study offers insights into policy discourse and design, emphasizing the need for strategic, collaborative, and contextually-aware responses to the evolving challenges within Japan's taxi industry.}

abstract = {Objective
Our objective was to develop an evaluation framework for electronic health record (EHR)-integrated innovations to support evaluation activities at each of four information technology (IT) life cycle phases: planning, development, implementation, and operation.
Methods
The evaluation framework was developed based on a review of existing evaluation frameworks from health informatics and other domains (human factors engineering, software engineering, and social sciences); expert consensus; and real-world testing in multiple EHR-integrated innovation studies.
Results
The resulting Evaluation in Life Cycle of IT (ELICIT) framework covers four IT life cycle phases and three measure levels (society, user, and IT). The ELICIT framework recommends 12 evaluation steps: (1) business case assessment; (2) stakeholder requirements gathering; (3) technical requirements gathering; (4) technical acceptability assessment; (5) user acceptability assessment; (6) social acceptability assessment; (7) social implementation assessment; (8) initial user satisfaction assessment; (9) technical implementation assessment; (10) technical portability assessment; (11) long-term user satisfaction assessment; and (12) social outcomes assessment.
Discussion
Effective evaluation requires a shared understanding and collaboration across disciplines throughout the entire IT life cycle. In contrast with previous evaluation frameworks, the ELICIT framework focuses on all phases of the IT life cycle across the society, user, and IT levels. Institutions seeking to establish evaluation programs for EHR-integrated innovations could use our framework to create such shared understanding and justify the need to invest in evaluation.
Conclusion
As health care undergoes a digital transformation, it will be critical for EHR-integrated innovations to be systematically evaluated. The ELICIT framework can facilitate these evaluations.}

abstract = {Within the scheduling framework, the potential of digital twin (DT) technology, based on virtualisation and intelligent algorithms to simulate and optimise manufacturing, enables an interaction with processes and modifies their course of action in time synchrony in the event of disruptive events. This is a valuable capability for automating scheduling and confers it autonomy. Automatic and autonomous scheduling management can be encouraged by promoting the elimination of disruptions due to the appearance of defects, regardless of their origin. Hence the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model oriented towards zero-disturbance and zero-disruption objectives has barely been studied. Both strategies combine the optimisation of production processes by implementing DTs and promoting ZDM objectives to facilitate the modelling of automatic and autonomous scheduling systems. In this context, this particular vision of the scheduling process is called smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS). The aim of this paper is to review the existing scientific literature on the scheduling problem that considers the DT technology approach and the ZDM model to achieve self-management and reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention. Specifically, 68 research articles were identified and analysed. The main results of this paper are to: (i) find methodological trends to approach SMS models, where three trends were identified; i.e. using DT technology and the ZDM model, utilising other enabling digital technologies and incorporating inherent SMS capabilities into scheduling; (ii) present the main SMS alignment axes of each methodological trend; (iii) provide a map to classify the literature that comes the closest to the SMS concept; (iv) discuss the main findings and research gaps identified by this study. Finally, managerial implications and opportunities for further research are identified.}

abstract = {In the past few years, blockchain has proven its necessity and unprecedented prospects in providing a secure environment for information exchange between two parties. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.}

abstract = {Recent contributions in the field of technology roadmapping often aim to apply various numerical models and tools to facilitate the roadmapping process and enrich its outcomes. This trend resulted in the emergence of so-called model-based technology roadmapping. We consider it as the future development of the traditional document-based paradigm. One of the general approaches to support the model-based roadmapping is to develop a roadmap's metamodel that would define it independently from the application context and link it to the existing roadmapping literature. In this paper, we attempt to create such a metamodel by generalizing and formalizing existing document-based roadmaps. We validate our metamodel via reproducing three very different roadmaps from the literature, not included in the set of roadmaps from which the metamodel was created, using the novel formal approach. The fact that these roadmaps were reproduced using the proposed metamodel indicates its applicability to many classes of real roadmaps. The results of this work seem beneficial for architects of the software tools for roadmapping and for the regular participants of roadmapping sessions.}

Earlier literature however mostly focused on either the characteristics i.e. critical success factors or competitiveness of maritime clusters in general and not on the components of MKCs, their interrelationships, and impact on the performance of constituent firms. This study proposes and tests a conceptual model of Maritime Knowledge Clusters (MKC) and the relations between their components, making use of survey data from 203 shipping professionals located in Singapore. Three theoretical perspectives, namely, relational view, knowledge-based view and resource-based view, have been employed. The results demonstrate that MKCs are substantiated by three critical components, in which the local knowledge cluster can develop global systemic mechanisms, thus further strengthening global linkages. Policy makers must endeavor to create a conducive local cluster environment with maritime firms being located in geographical proximity, and having local networks, knowledge base, and knowledge flows. They form the fundamental foundation for the growth of MKCs. Besides, maritime firms shall optimize the MKC’s local knowledge cluster to facilitate their global expansion, which will in turn boost the internationalization of the MKC.}

However, there is limited ophthalmology teaching within medical curricula, which has been further exasperated by COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, several educational strategies were implemented with modified curricula in ophthalmology as outlined in a recent review. Digital technology was shown to be effective in facilitating teaching; thus while the pandemic and its variants negatively impacted the delivery of ophthalmology education with strict restrictions placed on face-to-face interactions and onsite education, it also provided a force to drive digital transformation for teaching. This chapter highlights two digital teaching programs developed by our group and implemented to act as a countermeasure to the restrictions placed in response to the pandemic. The first digital teaching program was designed for pregraduate and undergraduate students to enhance interest and to increase academic exposure to basic clinical, research, and educational domains in ophthalmology. The second program we developed was a virtual ophthalmology rotation to allow medical students to continue their ophthalmic education remotely in both completely virtual and hybrid learning environments; to conduct and present research projects from home; and to network with faculty and prepare for residency applications via Internet platforms. These innovations will be incorporated in the future beyond the pandemic because they have proven that face-to-face learning is not required for all aspects of the ophthalmology medical student teaching. Optimizing teaching available through evidence-based digital education will lead to graduates who are highly trained in eye examination skills, resulting in improved patient eye care through timely diagnosis, referrals, and treatment.}

The success of integrating AI into organizations critically depends on workers' trust in AI technology. Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, as incorrect levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. The European Commission's High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) have adopted the position that we should establish a relationship of trust with AI and should cultivate trustworthy AI. This article investigates the links between trust in AI, concerns related to AI use, and the ethics related to such use. We used data collected in 2019 from more than 30,000 individuals across the EU28. The data focuses on living conditions, trust, and AI uses and concerns. An econometric model is used. The endogenous variable is an ordered measure of trust in AI. We use an ordered logit model to highlight the factors associated with an increased level of trust in AI in Europe. The results show that many concerns related to AI use are linked to AI trust, and the ability to try out AI applications will also have an impact on initial trust. To enhance trust, practitioners can try to maximize the technological features in AI systems. The representation of the AI as a humanoid or a loyal pet (e.g., a dog) will facilitate initial trust formation. Moreover, findings reveal an unequal degree of trust in AI across countries.}

The aim of this study is to understand the implementation of open innovation processes by SMEs while highlighting two critical processes: open innovation implementation (OII) and open ambidextrous innovation practices (OAIP). The study employes a second-order factor analysis incorporating multigroup structural invariance analysis to explore the differences in ambidextrous innovation practices across SME size categories using a sample of 615 SMEs in Thailand. The primary finding reveals and confirms a statistically significant positive relationship between the implementation of open innovation and the advancement of ambidextrous innovation practices. This relationship underlines the importance of embracing open innovation, as it fosters ambidextrous innovation, thereby enabling fresh perspectives, accelerating creativity, and facilitating knowledge exchange. Three categories of MSMEs—microenterprises, small enterprises, and medium-sized enterprises—are shown to be well positioned for adopting open innovation strategies, each demonstrating a significant ability to foster open innovation practices. In the study, practical and policy recommendations for business practitioners and policy-makers are presented, emphasizing the importance of understanding the organizational, managerial, technological, and contextual factors that underpin successful open innovation implementation. A novel structural second-order factor model that deepens our understanding of the complex relationships between open innovation processes is also introduced, offering valuable insights for academic researchers. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of SMEs embracing open innovation practices and promoting ambidextrous innovation for sustained success and growth, and key strategic takeaways are proposed based on the empirical item-scale results.}

In order to successfully transition towards digital servitization, fundamental reconfiguration of resources, organizational structures, work practices, infrastructure, culture, etc. are required. Hence, this paper performs a systematic literature review on prior studies covering dynamic capabilities for servitization and digital servitization. The purpose is to identify and compare the dynamic capabilities needed to facilitate a transition from “traditional” servitization to digital servitization. In doing so, this paper presents an integrated framework of dynamic capabilities to enable digital servitization, providing 22 micro-foundations for servitization and digital servitization, as well as the key challenges and enablers related to the transition from one to the other.}

In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997–2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.}

A partial least squares structural equation model and the fs-QCA technique were used to analyze the data collected. The results showed how two factors studied, Attitude and Facilitating Conditions directly affected the decision to use e-gov services. Attitude means that governments must find effective ways to entice positive attitudes toward using e-services, and Facilitating Conditions implies that the resources and facilities provided to users improve their intention to use. However, the second most robust relationship was associated with the influence of Performance Expectancy on Attitude, suggesting that the trust placed in e-gov by the citizens, based on previous experiences, is a crucial determinant of their attitude toward it and their behavior when using it.}

Based on the data from 278 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2019, multi-dimensional empirical tests were conducted to investigate the relationship between digital economy (DE) and spatial transfer of carbon emissions (CE). The results show that DE directly reduced CE. Mechanism analysis shows that DE reduced CE through local industrial transformation and upgrading (ITU). Spatial analysis shows that DE reduced local CE while aggravating neighboring CE. The spatial transfer of CE was attributed to the fact that when DE promoted the local ITU, it induced the transfer of the backward and polluting industries to neighboring regions, resulting in the spatial transfer of CE. Moreover, the spatial transfer effect of CE was maximum at 200 km. However, in recent years, rapid DE development has weakened the spatial transfer effect of CE. The results can provide insights into understanding the carbon refuge effect of industrial transfer in China in the context of DE and facilitate formulating appropriate industrial policies to promote inter-regional carbon reduction synergy. Thus, this study can provide a theoretical reference for achieving the dual-carbon target of China and the green economic recovery of other developing countries.}

However, many researchers ground the potential usability of the data on its quality. Organizations would benefit from receiving recommendations on the usability of the data before its use. We propose that the recommendation on the usability of the data be supported by a decision process, which includes a context-dependent data-quality assessment based on business rules. Ideally, this recommendation would be generated automatically. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) enables the assessment of data quality based on the evaluation of business rules, and also, provides stakeholders (e.g., data stewards) with sound support for the automation of the whole process of generation of a recommendation regarding usability based on data quality. The main contribution of the proposal involves designing and enabling both DMN-driven mechanisms and a guiding methodology (DMN4DQ) to support the automatic generation of a decision-based recommendation on the potential usability of a data record in terms of its level of data quality. Furthermore, the validation of the proposal is performed through the application of a real dataset.}

Best practices from spaces such as distance learning and virtual / remote laboratories can be leveraged to facilitate educators’ responses. This review is aimed at identifying evidence-based approaches for transforming hands-on labs into virtual or remote operation to achieve desired learning outcomes without compromising on soft skills and student self-efficacy. A critical review of the recent literature on delivering STEMM education laboratories in either a virtual or remote setting or a combination of both is presented here. Commonly emerging approaches are identified and strategies to implement remote or mixed-mode (a combination of remote and traditional lab components) delivery are highlighted. The value of these approaches to the educator is assessed based on claimed learning outcomes, availability of resources, technology, scheduling, and cost factors.}

The research undertakes an in-depth case study based approach. It uses data triangulation, where multiple sources of evidence (interviews, conference audio recordings and documents) are collected from the case organisation (a vendor) and its service ecosystem partners in the ICT sector. The partners included in the study are distributors, channel partners, competitors, and customers. B2B alliances are driven by the motivations to maximise strategic value and minimise transaction cost. Thus, using the ecosystem lens, we find that actors’ capabilities (resources and perceived value), vendor's approach to achieving strategic benefit and the channel governance mechanism enable value co-creation. However, using the transaction cost theory lens, we report that actors’ opportunistic behaviour, technological disruptions and new business model challenges lead to value co-destruction (in the form of termination of relationship, conflict and business liquidation). Alliance partners need to evaluate the strategic benefits of collaboration, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, market expansion and technology sharing, considering partners’ self-serving behaviour driven by transaction cost economies. All ecosystem actors are seeking to develop capabilities, exhibit knowledge differentiators, demonstrate technology leadership, reduce uncertainty and respond to new business model challenges thus causing value co-destruction. Thus, this research is more encompassing because it explores factors that lead to both value co-creation and co-destruction.}

Drawing upon justice theory, this paper conceptualizes and examines the critical role that fairness plays in consumers’ decision to use HIT. Structural equation models test hypotheses on how privacy concern and privacy knowledge related to technology, HIPAA, and data breaches affect trust and intention to use HIT and the role that perceived justice has in mediating these relationships. The findings show that perceived justice fully mediates the negative effect of privacy concern and partially mediates the positive effects of knowledge of technology and knowledge of HIPAA on trust and intention to use HIT.

This workshop examined recent advances in the use of co-processed active pharmaceutical ingredients as a technology to improve drug substance physicochemical properties and drug product manufacturing process robustness, and explored proposals for enabling commercialization of these transformative technologies. Regulatory considerations were discussed with a focus on the classification, CMC strategies, and CMC documentation supporting the use of this class of materials from clinical studies through commercialization. The workshop format was split between presentations from industry, academia and the FDA, followed by breakout sessions structured to facilitate discussion. Given co-processed API is a relatively new concept, the authors felt it prudent to compile these proceedings to gain further visibility to topics discussed and perspectives raised during the workshop, particularly during breakout discussions.

abstract = {Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China's nonferrous metal industry is important for reaching China's ambitious goals for carbon peaking and neutrality. Prior research identified several carbon abatement instruments for the industry. However, the dynamic influence of different mechanisms on CO2 emissions in the industry remains unclear, and few studies have researched CO2 emission reductions in two nonferrous metal related industrial subsectors: nonferrous metal ore mining and nonferrous metal smelting. This research evaluated the dynamic effect of abatement instruments on the CO2 emissions in these two subsectors. The research discovered the factors that are highly linked with CO2 emissions by using an enhanced Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology model. The dynamic influence of these factors on CO2 emissions in the two subsectors was investigated using a vector autoregressive model. Findings show that in the two subsectors, labour productivity and industrial value-added are the most important factors explaining CO2 changes. The two variables have a negative long-term effect on CO2 emissions in the nonferrous metal ores mining, and increase CO2 emissions in the smelting of nonferrous metals. Improving energy efficiency in the nonferrous metal smelting industry decreases the CO2 emissions only in the short term. In all sectors, lowering the electrical carbon emission factors and changing the energy structure using different techniques are expected to help reduce long-term CO2 emissions. These results are critical for the Chinese government in creating long- and short-term energy plans for the nonferrous metal sector.}

abstract = {Forensic science is facing a persistent crisis that is often addressed by organizational responses, with a strong focus on the improvement and standardisation of means and processes. However, organisations and processes are highly dependent on the political, economical and legal structures in which they operate. This may explain why most proposed solutions had difficulties in addressing the crisis up to now, as they could hardly be applied transversally to all forensic science models. Moreover, new tools and technologies are continuously developed by a quasi-infinite number of different scientific disciplines, thus leading to further diversity and fragmentation of forensic science. In this paper, it is proposed to shift the focus from means to purpose and consider forensic science current challenges in terms of discipline, before addressing organisations’ specific issues. As a distinct discipline, forensic science can refocus research and development on shared principles and purposes, such as reconstructing, monitoring, and preventing crime and security issues. This focus change will facilitate a better understanding of the trace as the object of study of forensic science and eventually lead to a more impactful and long-lasting effect. This approach will also foster the development of a forensic science culture (instead of a primarily technological culture) unified by purpose rather than means through more relevant education and research.}

We use the fuzzy-set approach by conducting qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability that exist among the 167 manufacturing and service firms in China that undergoes different levels of BMI. Results reveal that DI attributes work in three pathways to promote BMI, including organization-oriented with emphasis on improvisation, product-oriented by focusing on user experience and value proposition, and product-organization complemented. When to additionally include IT infrastructure capability for deeper analysis, results demonstrate three more representative configurations among DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability to facilitate BMI: IT-enabled organization-product orchestration, IT-enabled product-organization orchestration, and IT-dominated orchestration. This research contributes to DI literature by uncovering the configurations among DI attributes in promoting BMI, and clarifying the complicated interacting effects between DI attributes and IT infrastructure capability to facilitate BMI.}

The strengths and weaknesses of coal mining in Poland were also identified, along with its opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis). Innovative and sustainable development based on the Triple Helix Model (THM), as well as the Open innovation (OI) concept and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles were identified as opportunities for its sustainable development. The combination of these solutions should enable sustainable development of the industry, preserving its economic and social importance and reducing its negative impact on the environment. The use of new clean technologies in the operation and combustion of coal should reduce emissions of harmful substances into the environment. Intensive and government-supported cooperation between the scientific and research community and industry should significantly facilitate these processes. Another aspect important for the changes to be introduced is the social factor, for which the current situation represents an opportunity to preserve jobs in the mining industry, but also a challenge for its sustainable development. These seemingly mutually exclusive elements should form the basis of a new opening for Polish and European mining as an innovative industry based on knowledge and preserving the basic principles of ESG. The paper also outlines the most significant challenges facing the Polish mining industry on its way to innovative development. The article provides a new and relevant to the current reality perspective on the Polish mining industry in the context of the entire EU, for which the current geopolitical situation forces the necessity of setting a new direction of development. The geopolitical changes that have recently taken place in the global economy such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic and the armed conflict within Ukraine have caused very great turbulence in the energy market. Enthusiasm and uncritical adoption of green concepts in the EU has caused, along with the reduction of gas and coal imports from Russia, turbulence in the energy market. This situation has created a great opportunity for the development of the mining industry in Poland, which has not yet managed, following the example of other EU countries, to extinguish the industry. In order to take advantage of this opportunity and obtain a permanent place in the energy mix in the EU, it is necessary to rapidly develop the mining industry in a sustainable manner based on innovative solutions.}

Disruptive connected health technologies, or digitalization, are suggested to tackle the healthcare challenges and transform traditional care models. In Finland, the transformation is manifested by the development of various digital hospitals and citizen-centric care models that foster self-care by utilizing connected health technologies. In this paper we introduce qualitative research that uses social practice theory in order to understand how connected health technologies shape a pediatric day surgery practice in future digital hospitals. Major improvement needs were identified to center on discursive actions (i.e., communication that occurs between health professionals and patients), since hospital IT systems, data exchange, and internal and external communication were found to not support pediatric surgery practice as expected. To improve the current situation, we found out that there is a need to change the patient role to be more active, creating data that health professionals could use through their own patient record systems. Connected health solutions allow this type of interaction between things (i.e., communication through mobile apps, medical devices, etc.) and agents (i.e., health professionals). There is an urgent need to improve communication channels such as Chat, WhatsApp, and mobile applications that gather all necessary information and instructions from patients before and after the surgery. However, these solutions cannot be co-created separately from the clinical decision systems that allow discursive actions among healthcare professionals. These solutions, e.g. mobile applications designed to support patients going through the surgery practice, will also significantly impact and change pediatric surgery practice at hospitals.}

Modern chemistry is the backbone of our society, but it is also a major contributor to global environmental pollution and the ongoing climate crisis. The transition toward a sustainable future requires a radical transformation of how chemistry is designed, developed, and used. This represents a “break it or make it” challenge for the chemical industry with significant technology lock-in and high entry barriers to radical innovations. We propose that urgently required systemic changes in chemical industry, research and development (R&D), chemicals assessment and management, and education to advance sustainable chemistry are attainable through increased and more rapid adoption of digitalization and new digital tools. This will enable flexible data exchange, increased transparency of information flows along cross-country chemical, material, and product life cycles, and chemistries that are safe and sustainable by design, addressing the complexity of chemicals-environment-health interactions and lowering the costs of entry into chemical R&D and manufacture, and new, more sustainable and collaborative business models.}

A knowledge of the factors that affect student learning could help universities and study centres adjust their curricula and teaching methods to the needs of their students. One of the first measures employed by teaching institutions was to create Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). This type of environment makes it possible to attract a larger number of students because it enables them to study from wherever they are in the world, meaning that the student’s location is no longer a constraint. Moreover, VLEs facilitate access to teaching resources, they make it easier to monitor the activity of the teaching staff and of the interactions between students and teachers. Thus, online environments make it possible to assess the factors that cause the students’ academic performance to increase or decrease. To understand the factors that influence the university learning process, this paper applies a series of automatic learning techniques to a public dataset, including tree-based models and different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Having applied these techniques to the dataset, the number of times students have accessed the resources made available on VLE platforms has been identified as a key factor affecting student performance. This factor has been analysed by conducting a real case study which has involved 120 students doing a masters degree over a VLE platform. Concretely, the case study participants were masters degree students in areas related to computer engineering at the University of Salamanca.}

Platforms and ecosystems can play vital roles in the proliferation of technologies, which can facilitate a digital transformation of society aimed at equitable and efficient service delivery to citizens. Despite being innovative, citizen-centric, and citizen-inclusive, such platforms has been observed to be rare in emerging economies. Our study assesses the factors that lead to the intention to continue to use these platforms, with the objective of establishing a revised approach to better governance through these platform-based services. A conceptual framework is proposed, based on an integration of various models, and tested using primary data from citizens subscribing to platform-based government services. The results indicate that a continuous availability of such services has better predictive power for the continual-use intention. A unique contribution of the study worth highlighting is the significance of the factor, “sovereign structural assurance,” a pre-requisite for strengthening the degree of control. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that platforms should invest in controls for structural assurance. These interventions can serve as contrivances that create a sustainable model for such services. A successful convergence of the factors would accelerate the government services by transforming the public service landscape.}

For the manufacturing corporations that provide maintenance services, the efficiency of industrial maintenance plays a crucial role in the competitiveness and is tightly related to the technical documentation supporting maintenance. However, the process of documentation creation faces several challenges due to lack of access to the physical equipment and difficulties in remote communication between globally distributed departments. To address these shortcomings, this research investigates the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate asynchronous collaboration of globally dispersed departments involved in the pipeline of maintenance method and documentation creation. The presented proof-of-concept (the COVE-VR platform) has been developed as an academia-industry collaboration and evaluated iteratively with subject matter experts. The proposed VR platform consists of two virtual environments and eight virtual tools, which allow interaction with virtual prototypes (3D CAD models) and means of digital content creation. Our findings show the high relevance of the developed solution for the needs of industrial departments and the ability to support asynchronous collaboration among them. This article delivers qualitative findings on the value of VR technology and presents guidelines on how to develop virtual tools for digital content creation within VR, adaptable to other industrial contexts. We suggest providing embedded guidance and design consistency to ensure smooth interactions with virtual tools and further discuss the importance of proper positioning, the transparency of operations and the information property of generated content.}

The main aim of this paper is to understand the concept of Management 4.0, its technologies and applications for proper management systems. As Management 4.0 enhances process control, the chance of human error is reduced, leading to increased efficiency. It enables rapid and intelligent decision-making, reduces costs, accelerates growth, and raises profitability. Management 4.0 technologies and advanced data analytics are helpful to make smart supply chain management well suited to fulfil industry 4.0. Thus, to overcome various obstacles and effectively deploy Management 4.0 technologies in manufacturing industries, top management must establish a clear asset performance management plan with the help of process engineers familiar with industrial system failure occurrences and what operators need to improve. Management 4.0 involves advanced technologies, system connectivity, data collection & analysis at the organisation level. Management 4.0 is expected to be a critical component in the long-term survival of any business, either manufacturing or service-providing organisations. This paper explores the development of Management 4.0 and its dimensions and transformations through Management 4.0 perspectives.

So far, traditional nostrification processes face challenges related to high process cycle times, elevated fees, and fraud incidents. In the higher education domain, blockchain-based approaches have emerged to revitalize the verification of academic qualifications, but they mostly rely on closed concepts offering their facility to a limited circle of entities. As a result, the verification of degrees is not publicly available to any third party. Moreover, in most cases, a concise process-aware approach describing the intended functionality with appropriate models is missing; this absence raises ambiguity and trust issues in the implemented application. This paper presents the design and early implementation of the VerDe (Verified Degrees) platform; a proposed blockchain-based application for registration and verification of academic qualifications. The novelty of the approach presented in this paper is the implementation of VerDe as a decentralized application utilizing Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN). This work demonstrates that usage of BPMN constructs provides an efficient method in addressing blockchain usability and complexity issues and facilitates the design and implementation of blockchain-based applications. The benefits of deploying VerDe in conjunction with BPMN are an efficient and transparent facility able to handle mobility consequences, detect fraud, and overcome administrative barriers by offering the verification capability to any third-party, and employing a custom-made token that emulates the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).}

abstract = {The digital transformation is an accumulation of various digital advancements, such as the transformation of the web phenomenon. The participatory web that allows for active user engagement and gather intelligence has been widely recognised as a value add tool by organisations of all shapes and sizes to improve business productivity and efficiency. However, its ability to facilitate sustainable business-to-business (B2B) activities has lacked focus in the business and management literature to date. This qualitative research is exploratory in nature and fills this gap through findings arising from interviews of managers and by developing taxonomies that highlight the capability of participatory web over passive web to enable different firms to engage in business operations. For this purpose, two important interrelated functions of business i.e. operations and marketing have been mapped against three dimensions of sustainability. Consequently, this research demonstrates the ability of big data and social media analytics within a participatory web environment to enable B2B organisations to become profitable and remain sustainable through strategic operations and marketing related business activities. The research findings will be useful for both academics and managers who are interested in understanding and further developing the business use of participatory web tools to achieve business sustainability. Hence, this may be considered as a distinct way of attaining sustainability.}

abstract = {Digital transformations in the built environment address inefficiencies and sustainability issues in the building lifecycle. Accordingly, electronic procurement systems (EPSs) have benefits that improve the economic, environmental and social initiatives for sustainable construction. However, the slow rate of EPSs uptake evinces the need for strategic approaches towards their widespread implementation. Scoping the previous studies on EPSs, there is a lack of research on the influence dynamics of these strategies for effective promotion of EPSs in the built environment. Therefore, this study investigates the dynamic influences of strategies by using the neurofuzzy model for the effective promotion of EPSs implementation. Through a comprehensive literature review, 14 strategies were employed in an expert survey. A total of 121 datasets were collected and analyzed in the study. From the data analysis, five groups were derived: technology education, innovation culture management, technological stimulation environment, incentives and partnership mechanism and organizational integration support. Further, the neurofuzzy model and sensitivity analysis were used to predict and determine optimal strategies for promoting EPSs implementation. The findings showed dynamic ways of hybridizing the strategies for EPSs promotion. Two hybrid-approaches, in addition to other strategies, that actively enhance effective EPS implementation are ‘innovation culture management – technology education’ and ‘innovation culture management – incentives and partnership mechanism’. Additionally, the combinations of strategies that result in low promotion of EPSs were also highlighted. This study provides a deepened understanding of the dynamic influences of strategies for researchers and practitioners to effectively promote the widespread implementation of EPSs in the built environment.}

Building on the market-driven view and the dynamic capabilities view of competitive strategy, we examine SM use in a framework of market-sensing and customer-linking capabilities that influence firm performance. Our research model posits that market orientation stimulates SM use to enhance market-sensing capability thereby facilitating two customer-linking capabilities, namely customer relationship management and brand management, which collectively contribute to greater marketing performance and financial performance. Our research model is empirically tested using a survey of 143 UK B2B SMEs. The findings broadly support our theorization in which the strategic use of SM, an essential part of market-sensing capability, enhances customer-linking capabilities. Interestingly, although SM use influences brand management capability, its suggested influences on both customer relationship management capability and marketing performance occur only through the mediation of brand management capability. Both customer-linking capabilities positively influence marketing performance and in turn financial performance. Our findings provide novel conceptual and empirical advancement of how market-centric B2B SMEs strategically use SM to enhance their market-sensing and in turn customer-linking capabilities, and hence firm performance.}

Therefore, this study empirically examines antecedents to, and consequences of, successful acceptance of AI practices by B2B SMEs in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model based on the technology-organisation-environment framework is developed which considers the impact of AI enablers and AI readiness on the acceptance of AI practices, and the impact of this on relational governance, performance, and SMEs' AI-based business customer interaction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling of survey data collected from B2B SMEs (n = 392). The results showed that, of the AI enablers, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by both technology roadmapping and attitude but not professional expertise. Of the AI readiness variables, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by infrastructure and awareness but not technicality. The acceptance of AI practices was found to significantly affect AI-enabled relational governance and performance, and SME's business customer AI-based interaction. This study provides a broader base for theoretical and practical understanding of issues related to AI practices in SMEs and the B2B sector in general.}

At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin – a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation. For design-oriented, artifact building research, a higher Technology Readiness Level can thus be achieved (compared to the level that idea development methods typically attain).}

This study applies the Herringbone model of organizational resilience to evaluate the internal and external factors that enable SMEs to (re)build resilience during COVID-19. In-depth interviews with owner-managers of tourism organizations in Christchurch, New Zealand reveal several themes and sub-themes that reflect not only a close influence of the owner/manager PsyCap on organizational resilience, but also the role of internal (ISC) and external (ESC) social capital in facilitating and hindering organizational resilience. As such, the study highlights the interplay between psychological and social resources in facilitating organizational recovery during COVID-19 using resilience capacities and activities.

This paper presents examples on how the digitalisation of chemical processes as graphs can facilitate their study and analysis for developing alternative process designs. In a process graph, inputs, outputs and unit operations are represented as nodes and streams are edges which can be weighted using process variables such as flow rate. Once a process is represented as a graph, community detection algorithms can be applied to identify process modules and obtain their modularity. The novel approach presented is based on modular decompositions to identify highly related unit operations in a flowsheet which can be analysed for insightful directions to improve a chemical process. The approach showed to be helpful in analysing a biofuel production process by adopting a combined economic and greenhouse gas emissions analysis at a modular level for hot spot analysis and identification of opportunities for decarbonisation. In an application to process integration, CO2 capture and utilisation networks are analysed in terms of its modularity and efficiency in processing CO2. In both cases, the improved designs had higher modularity values suggesting a correlation between modularity and technical performance which needs to be investigated further. Finally, prospective applications of modularity and modular decomposition approaches to realise several digitalisation tasks are presented.}

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.}

abstract = {Manufacturers, especially SMEs, are increasingly adopting digitalization to improve their agility to respond to the fluctuating market dynamics and to be transparent. To achieve sustained competitiveness, SMEs are shedding their reluctance to invest in technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics. Further, Manufacturing Execution System (MES) can serve as the intelligence hub, integrating product lifecycle with manufacturing, augmenting the IoT investments to orchestrate their facilities to be aligned to deliver what the customer needs. MES is a pivotal function integrating virtual and physical worlds and that makes it worthy of deeper examination. Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) is the evolved state of standalone MES, and it consolidates production processes to facilitate quality management, scheduling, manufacturing execution and more. The motivation of this research is to study the potential barriers of implementing MOM/MES that reduces its effectiveness and it has three goals. Firstly, the current knowledge associated with MOM/MES needs to be examined to derive its relevance, functions and benefits. Secondly, potential barriers of MOM/MES are to be identified that can reduce its effectiveness. Thirdly, approaches need to be established to overcome the barriers and improve the overall value of the initiative. SMEs cannot afford delayed returns on their digital investments; therefore, it is crucial to mitigate the barriers of implementing MOM/MES. This study resulted in calling attention to five barriers and its corresponding mitigations - constructive closed-loop, cross-functional integration, flexible operations orchestrations, high-availability cloud connection and insightful data contextualization. Most barriers discussed in the past studies can be classified as readiness related, i.e. funding, expertise, compatibility, priority, capacity, security, whereas the barriers discussed in this research paper are directly related to implementation. Knowing the barriers and its mitigation approaches, manufacturers can now pre-empt measures to neutralize the challenges and make MOM/MES adoptions successful.}

abstract = {This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs – those available – to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data – if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy – in the absence of BIM – are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures.}

DT is rapidly diffusing in numerous industries with the interdisciplinary advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research trends in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G-and-Beyond networks) and design tools, and current computational intelligence paradigms (e.g., edge and cloud computing-enabled data analytics, federated learning). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT’s adoption.}

Questionnaires have been distributed to collect employees’ preferences concerning the circular supply chain management criteria (profit, innovation, sustainability, and optimization). The responses have been organized into three clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique is adopted to evaluate these technologies since it constitutes a reliable managerial tool when vagueness impacts the smooth operation of the supply chain. Results indicate the ranking order of the investigated digital technologies (CPS>IoT>CM>BDA) as well as the circular benefits and the supply chain attributes imparted upon implementing these technologies. Such benefits and attributes are provided to assess the impact of these digital technologies on a circular economy. Lastly, the perspective of the selection process affected by other factors, such as the enterprise’s extroversion level and its internal structure, are discussed.}

The results from testing nine research hypotheses show that five factors, namely Technology Affinity, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Condition, Technology Readiness, and Regulatory Support, positively impact the intention of applying Blockchain in journalism activities in Vietnam. Two factors, namely Performance Expectancy and Trust, were not positively strongly correlated to the use of blockchain.

abstract = {With the recent digitization of the construction industry, the management of a project, from the idea to the use phases, is now based on the Building Information Modelling System (BIM). While the use of BIM begins to show its effectiveness in building construction, it does not satisfy yet linear infrastructure domain. One of the requirements is to manage the infrastructure project data around a common information system, as defined by the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) definition. Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways. The advent of new information technologies, such as Digital Twin, is promoting industrial digital transformation. Effective lifecycle management must now consider all phases of the project, especially Operations and Maintenance (O&M), where the use of the 3D model is no longer the digital model, but the digital duplicate of the Infrastructure. To facilitate the digital transition when projects are split into several phases, the linear infrastructure must be represented by one and only one Digital Twin during its life cycle.}

abstract = {Applications of digital twin (DT) contribute to smart manufacturing via the integration of the cyber domain and the real world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is based on machine learning (ML) is generally recognized as being among the most promising technological developments in the manufacturing industry. Despite this, machine learning techniques call for enormous quantities of high-quality training datasets, and in the case of supervised ML, human labeling of such datasets is often necessary. Collecting and analyzing historical performance data to uncover operational insights has been a long-standing driver of efficiency and innovation for a wide variety of businesses, across all industrial sectors and even farther afield. However, the possible advantages of this method have not yet been leveraged to their maximum. There is a tendency for vast volumes of data, spanning anything from the current state of subsurface assets to the attitude that customers express on social media postings, to go mostly unrecorded and unanalyzed. This may be a problem for businesses. However, due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, supporting production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently quite costly. Cyber Twins (CTs) are an extension of DTs that we propose using to facilitate the rapid and low-cost creation of Industry 4.0 applications. CTs may incorporate machine simulators and provide semantic descriptions of the machines they model, which makes it possible to test applications without putting the production line at risk or incurring additional costs. The applications for Industry 4.0 are based on CT and the accompanying cost models are the primary topics of this research. Second, the paper provides empirical results that connect existing academic literature to the interdependencies between edge components and internal and external services and systems in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The novel aspect of this research is a new method for creating a DT, or a virtual representation that acts as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process as defined by a conceptual model. This is the chapter’s primary contribution. The approach that was used to conduct the research for this article was conceptually similar to an investigation of complex, linked, and coupled systems using the grounded theory. This research provides an outline of how to increase AI development in IoT networks via integrating human-computer interactions across different knowledge management systems. These interactions take place in different information management systems. In addition, the previously used real-time controllable method has been improved, as well as optimized. Additionally, it performs simulation testing on the method in both a serial and a parallel fashion. The relevant mining time of the improved algorithm is shown to be substantially less than the time required by the conventional data mining method when applied to the same dataset, as shown by the test results when the ideal scenario of the parallel algorithm has been achieved. The amount of time required for conventional mining is around three and a half times as long as the amount of time required for data mining in this study, and the amount of power that the optimization method requires to operate has been decreased to 20W. With the help of AI, the manufacturing model (DT) and the decision support system are able to include all of the information generated by these subsystems. DT data technology facilitates the identification of pertinent information that can be processed and used to inform managerial decision-making. Applications of AI may open a wide variety of doors in the manufacturing industry, leading to the creation of new business models and the improvement of existing procedures. A formal model was used to define the landscape to guarantee the feasibility of conducting an in-depth analysis of the status and progression of the landscape, while taking into account DT and other technologies. The adoption of DT and Industrial Internet of Things for modeling of a real enterprise’s production process was taken into consideration. However, Digital Twin Store (DTS) has stricter standards, particularly in regard to the real-time engagement that is expected. A new technique that satisfies the aforementioned characteristics may be found in the use of AI, which is an efficient way of boosting the intelligence of the physical shop floor. In this piece of research, a conceptual framework for AI-enhanced DTS in interaction is presented. The real-time engagement is significantly increased by AI-enhanced DTS, thanks to its predictive control. The AI-enhanced interaction implementation technique in DTS is also discussed in length in this presentation. Finally, the DTS has implemented the necessary technology to support interaction.}

abstract = {The UN's sustainable development goals underscore engaging supply-chain stakeholders with environmentally friendly practices. Small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) are key participants in several supply chains, but their operations often produce a significant environmental impact. Their transition to sustainable practices is challenging because they operate with constrained resources, which are mostly invested in pressing activities. Therefore, evidence is needed that shows the benefits of investing limited resources in sustainable activities to support decision-making in SMEs. Research has neglected to connect circular economy and sustainable-oriented innovation whilst accounting for external factors affecting the implementation of sustainable processes and technology within SMEs in developing countries. This paper fills that gap by analyzing the impact of external factors on the implementation of circular economy and technology, and their influence on sustainable-oriented innovation and sustainable performance. Responses from 165 Mexican SMEs have been collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling to test direct and indirect effects between constructs. Findings reveal that while both governmental support and customer pressure facilitate the adoption of circular economy, only governmental support contributes directly to technology implementation. They also highlight the value of circular economy to support the adoption of sustainable-oriented innovation and to mediate the relationship between technology implementation and sustainable-oriented innovation. The overarching finding is that circular economy promoting sustainability-oriented innovation has a positive impact on financial, environmental, and social performance. This is a key implication to inform managers in SMEs on the potential benefits of investing in sustainable solutions.}

However, accurately defining and measuring its impact on national economies remains a complex endeavor. This paper explores the definition, measurement, role, and impacts of the digital economy across various economies. It also examines the involvement of governments and telecommunication regulators in assessing the digital economy and identifies future directions for developing countries. A systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA Model is employed to investigate the factors and indices used to measure the digital economy. The findings highlight ongoing efforts to harmonize the definition and metrics; nonetheless, challenges persist due to the scarcity of appropriate datasets and variations in country-specific definitions. Additionally, the effectiveness of existing digital economy indices and toolkits in assessing the level of digitalization in developing countries is evaluated. The paper concludes that despite ongoing efforts to bridge the gaps, the concept of the digital economy remains defined and measured differently, necessitating a new definition that accounts for various contextual peculiarities. Furthermore, a roadmap is proposed to develop a toolkit that ensures comprehensive measurement, thus preventing an underestimation of the digital economy's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in developing countries. The paper underscores the need for international and multi-stakeholder dialogue to establish a common understanding of the digital economy's definition and measurement. Developing countries, such as Nigeria, are urged to develop or adopt new metrics tailored to their unique circumstances, facilitating an accurate and efficient quantification of the digital economy's impact on crucial indicators like GDP. Improved statistical data collection and recording methodologies are recommended for both governments and the private sector. Moreover, the paper advocates for the establishment of a Digital Economy Advisory Board (DEAB) in developing countries to maximize the benefits of the ongoing global transition to the digital economy.}

Evidence from diverse fields is synthesised to illustrate the nature of systemic risks and our evolving understanding of resilience. We describe research methods that aim to capture systemic complexity to inform better management practices and increase resilience to crises. Finally, we recommend specific, practical actions for improving transboundary climate risk management and resilience building.

The education sector has benefited from this ICT-driven revolution, which has provided and expanded multiple new tools and teaching methods that did not exist just a few decades ago. In light of this technological change, virtual laboratories (VLs) based on the use of virtual reality (VR) have emerged, which are increasingly used to facilitate the teaching–learning process in a wide range of training activities, both academic and professional types. The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning.}

abstract = {Background
Personal health record (PHR) has been extensively used in developed countries; however, it has been limitedly adopted in developing countries. This study was conducted in Indonesia: a developing country with the largest population in Southeast Asia. PHR that is integrated with health providers is needed to achieve a transformation from a health provider-centered to a patient-centered healthcare system.
Objective
To qualitatively analyze barriers and facilitators of PHR adoption by health facilities in Indonesia from the technological, organizational, environmental, and individual factors.
Methods
In this qualitative study, we used semi-structured interviews with three health facility directors, 17 IT heads, eight physicians, and three nurses from 10 primary healthcare facilities, nine government hospitals, and six private hospitals in Indonesia. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis in NVivo 12. The analysis stages involved familiarizing data, generating initial codes, searching themes, evaluating themes, defining and naming themes, and writing reports.
Results
Regarding technological factors, the barriers to PHR adoption include security and privacy, interoperability, and infrastructure. Organizational support can facilitate PHR adoption in terms of organizational factors, while a lack of human resources is a barrier to PHR adoption. Regarding environmental factors, the lack of government regulations is the barrier to PHR adoption, while competition between health facilities and vendor support could facilitate PHR adoption. Finally, regarding individual factors, perceived usefulness and ease of use can be facilitators of PHR adoption, while user attitudes and e-health literacy can be barriers to PHR adoption.
Conclusions
This study is expected to comprehensively understand PHR adoption in Indonesia and could be applied to other developing countries with similar technological, legal, or cultural characteristics as Indonesia. This study also provides information that can guide health regulators, health facilities, or PHR vendors in planning the implementation of integrated PHR.}

A research model is proposed suggesting that developing a digital organisational culture facilitates both the process of business digitisation and the generation of value from digital tools, with the ultimate goal of improving organisational performance. The research involved 93 production centres of a multinational company with presence in more than 10 countries. The theoretical model was tested by using structural equation modelling. The results show that business digitisation can boost the development of value activities, but companies will only unleash this potential if they incorporate a digital organisational culture.

This includes the recognition of professional status, social and working conditions. Nurses make use of a problem based scientific method to assess, plan, implement and evaluate care. Nursing care plans serve as a guide for allocating care activities. The efficacy of nursing resource management at the point of care directly influences the quality of care received by patients as well as staff satisfaction and productivity. Linking electronic care plans and nursing documentation with electronic health/medical records can facilitate data analytics, improve efficiency and the effectiveness of services delivered.

In contrast, it exerts a positive second order effect on economic performance, which should then be pursued as a long term target. A process innovation strategy based on I4.0 technologies improves the effect of Leanness on operational performance, which also leads to higher economic outcomes.

However, their abilities to participate in the online service system are often undermined by a continuing ‘digital divide’. This divide may be exacerbated by the strategies of service providers who fail to recognise and respond to the needs of older rural clients. This paper is based on a case study in Clare, a small rural town in South Australia, and examines the experiences of older residents and local service providers in trying to engage online for digital service delivery. Drawing on two sets of in-depth interviews, the study uses a mix of thematic content analysis and social network analysis to identify the nature and extent of digital interactions between older people and service providers, and the enablers and challenges for online service engagement. Older participants demonstrated considerable interest in learning how to use the Internet for accessing particular services, with social support networks and third party facilitators being crucial enablers. Service providers’ ambitions to engage with older people online appeared more limited as a result of entrenched stereotypes of older non-users, a lack of internal digital skills, as well as organisational and funding constraints. The case study findings emphasise the importance of balancing the views of older people and service providers in the design of online engagement strategies. These insights are critical for improving online service delivery in rural communities affected by an increasing withdrawal of physical services.}

However, seaport contexts entail complexities in terms of stakeholder involvement and business processes that must be considered thoroughly toward the successful adoption of IOISs. This research seeks to identify factors influencing the successful adoption of IOISs in seaports. It follows a grounded theory approach relying on semi-structured interviews and expert opinions to identify facilitating conditions for the adoption of IOISs. Survey research was conducted in order to investigate the appraisal of different ports in Latin America and the Caribbean region regarding the diverse conditions. The results obtained were analyzed descriptively and through a Principal Components Analysis. The latter was conducted in order to discern relevant dimensions influencing the adoption of IOISs in seaports. The results of the study allow deriving managerial insights and practical recommendations to support technological plans at ports and guide the decision-making regarding the digitalization process.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing socioeconomic crisis has impeded progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). This paper investigates the impact of COVID 19 on the progress of the SDGs and provides insight into how green recovery stimulus, driven by circular economy (CE)-based solid waste management (SWM) could assist in attaining the intended targets of UN-SDG. It was understood in this review that the guiding principles of the UN-SDGs such as, public health, environmental concerns, resource value and economic development are similar to those that have driven the growth of waste management activities; thus, in order to achieve the goals of UN-SDG, a circular economy approach in solid waste management system should be prioritized in the post-COVID economic agenda. However, policy, technology and public involvement issues may hinder the shift to the CE model; therefore, niche growth might come from developing distinctive waste management-driven green jobs, formalizing informal waste pickers and by focusing in education and training of informal worker. The review also emphasized in creating green jobs by investing in recycling infrastructure which would enable us to address the climate change related concerns which is one of the key target of UN- SDG. The CE-based product designs and business models would emphasize multifunctional goods, extending the lifespan of products and their parts, and intelligent manufacturing to help the public and private sectors maximise product utility (thus reducing waste generation) while providing long-term economic and environmental benefits. The study also recommended strong policies that prioritized investments in decentralization of solid waste systems, localization of supply chains, recycling and green recovery, information sharing, and international collaboration in order to achieve the UN-SDGs.}

It also examines the relationship between the dimensions of SC resilience and operational performance. Based on data collected from 206 Chinese manufacturers, the proposed hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that employee participation played the most powerful role in improving supplier, customer, and internal resilience. Moreover, employee skills only facilitate internal and customer resilience but have no significant impact on supplier resilience. By contrast, employee incentives do not influence the dimension of SC resilience. It was also found that both internal and customer resilience have positive effects on operational performance, while supplier resilience has no significant effect. The findings contribute to literature and practice.}

This technology has the potential to improve the reliability and scalability of organizational systems and leads to an enhanced focus on core business and strategy. Despite the Australian Federal Government's ‘cloud-first’ strategy and policies and the Queensland State Government's ‘digital-first’ strategy, the adoption of cloud services at the local government level has been limited, largely due to a lack of specificity among government regulations and a lack of regulations that provide support to local governments. This empirical study deploys a mixed research method designed to develop a cloud regulations model to assist governments in adopting cloud computing services. By integrating Australian Cloud Policy Frameworks with the extant research on cloud computing, this study conducted 21 field interviews with Information Technology (IT) managers and surveyed 480 IT staff from Australia's 47 local governments. This research paper presents and validates a revised set of factors used to develop government regulations specific to cloud computing adoption. The factors that we found to be statistically significant were cost, quality of services, security, privacy, management, government-based facilitating conditions, and firm-based facilitating conditions regulations. Based on these findings, this research concludes that government regulation is a significant aspect in decision making for the adoption of any new technology such as cloud computing.}

As cities expand and populations grow, the demand for land resources intensifies, leading to a misallocation between available land resources and urban development requirements. Therefore, using a panel fixed-effects model, this study explores the impact of land resources misallocation (LRM) on environmental pollution (EP) using 267 prefecture-level city data from 2011 to 2020. Our findings show that LRM significantly increases EP with a time lag effect. LRM increases the number of urban industrial enterprises and thus increases EP. Implementing the broadband China strategy negatively moderates the positive relationship between LRM and EP. There is a threshold effect of LRM on EP, which is more evident in cities with high levels of EP. The promotion effect of LRM on EP will be more evident in southern cities, cities with smaller population sizes and cities with lower digitalization levels. This study clarifies the mechanism between LRM in EP and the active role of broadband China strategy, which has important practical significance for promoting government personnel in optimizing land resource allocation to achieve green development.}

The findings show that neighborhood effects influence the adoption of clean cooking fuels by rural households in the same village through social norms and social multiplier effects. Neighborhood effects also indirectly promote the adoption of clean cooking fuels by rural households through the Internet. There is heterogeneity in the neighborhood effects on the adoption of clean cooking fuels by rural households. Therefore, this study recommends related policies to facilitate the transition to clean cooking fuel in rural regions.}

During the evolution of research on lot sizing, the seminal economic order quantity (EOQ) model proposed by Harris [1913. How many parts to make at once. Factory, the Magazine of Management, 10 (2), 135-136.] has remained the most popular model, despite its limitations. To support lot sizing decisions in practice, researchers have frequently extended Harris’ basic EOQ model to better reflect the characteristics of real production processes. One of these extensions is the consideration of controllable (variable) production rates, which gives production planners more flexibility in managing the build-up and depletion of inventory and in controlling costs. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of EPQ-type lot sizing models that consider controllable production rates. First, the paper proposes a conceptual framework that captures the characteristics of controllable production rates including the planning horizon (short vs. long term), the number of potential interventions per production run (one vs. multiple), the effect of controllable production rates on the performance of the inventory system (e.g., unit production costs, energy consumption, product quality), and the type of lot sizing model considered (e.g., two-stage models, multi-stage models, multi-item models). Secondly, the paper presents the results of a systematic literature review and evaluates the state-of-research of lot sizing models with controllable production rates. Based on the analysis of the literature, key trends are summarized and promising research opportunities are discussed.}

abstract = {In the current modern era of information and technology, the concept of Building Information Modeling (BIM), has made revolutionary changes in different aspects of engineering design, construction, monitoring, and management of infrastructure assets, especially bridges. In the field of bridge engineering, Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM), as a specific form of BIM, includes digital twinning of bridge assets associated with geometrical information and non-geometrical inspection data. BrIM has demonstrated tremendous potential in substituting traditional paper-based documentation and hand-written reports with digital bridge documentation/transformation, allowing professionals and managers to execute bridge management more efficiently and effectively. However, concerns remain about the quality of the acquired data in BrIM development, as well as lack of research on utilizing these information for remedial actions/decisions in a reliable Bridge Management System (BMS), which are mainly reliant on the knowledge and experience of the involved inspectors, or asset managers, and are susceptible to a certain degree of subjectivity. To address these concerns, this research paper presents a comprehensive methodology as an advanced asset management system that employs BrIM data to improve and facilitate the BMS. This innovative BMS is comprised of a precise Terrestrial Laser Scan (TLS)-derived BrIM as a qualitative digital replica of the existing bridge, incorporating geometrical and non-geometrical information of the bridge elements, and equipped with a requirement-driven framework in a redeveloped condition assessment model for priority ranking of bridge elements based on their health condition. In another step ahead, the proposed BMS integrates a Decision Support System (DSS) to score the feasible remedial strategies and provide more objective decisions for optimal budget allocation and remedial planning. This methodology was further implemented via a developed BrIM-oriented BMS plugin and validated through a real case study on the Werrington Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge in New South Wales, Australia. The finding of this research confirms the reliability of BrIM-oriented BMS implementation and the integration of proposed DSS for priority ranking of bridge elements that require more attention based on their structural importance and material vulnerability, as well as optimizing remedial actions in a practical way while preserving the bridge in a safe and healthy condition.}

The research model is tested through a large-scale questionnaire survey of 269 UK business managers. Our findings suggest that IAAAM provides a more comprehensive model for explaining and predicting managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using AI. Our research contributes conceptually and empirically to the emerging literature on using AI for organizational decision-making. Further, regarding the practical implications of using AI for organizational decision-making, we highlight the importance of developing favorable facilitating conditions, having an effective mechanism to alleviate managers’ personal concerns, and having a balanced consideration of both the benefits and the dark side associated with using AI.}

One possible application is to support manual quality control at the end of a production line by an automated quality control system based on data driven predictive analysis of the acquired shop floor data. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of such a predictive quality system for a deep drawing manufacturing process of car body parts. As a first step, we formalized the experience and expertise of the domain experts to enable automated a-posteriori quality assessment of the deep drawing process data. As a second step, we trained a combination of two long short-term memory neural networks with the auto-labeled data to predict the occurrence of process failures, i.e. cracks within the manufactured car body part, enabling automated a-priori quality assessment of the deep drawing process. We show that our model correctly predicts the occurrence of more than 94% of the process failures, facilitating the possibility to react to failures pre-emptively before they actually occur. We argue that our approach can be transferred to many other production processes whose quality control can be supported by the acquisition of time series data from the involved production machines.}

Résumé
Alors que la pandémie, toujours en cours, a causé plus de cinq millions de décès, la portée et la rapidité des avancées réalisées au cours de la dernière année en matière de découverte scientifique, de communication des données et sur le plan technologique ont été stupéfiantes. Il ne s’agit pas de savoir « si », mais plutôt « quand » nous devrons faire face à la prochaine pandémie, et son ampleur et sa gravité dépendront de l’efficacité avec laquelle nous exploiterons la technologie et la gestion des données pour créer des écosystèmes flexibles, qui faciliteront la collaboration, permettront d’offrir des soins équitables et favoriseront l’innovation. Le présent article de synthèse vise à cerner les défis émergents dans le domaine des soins de santé mis en lumière durant la pandémie et les innovations qui nous ont permis de nous adapter et de continuer à offrir des soins aux patients. La pandémie a révélé la nécessité de modifier radicalement les paradigmes de soins et l’utilisation des technologies en tenant compte de considérations liées à la fracture numérique et à la littératie en santé pour que les interventions numériques en santé atteignent leur plein potentiel et améliorent les résultats de santé. Nous aborderons les progrès de la télémédecine, la surveillance des patients à distance et les technologies portables émergentes. Malgré les promesses de la santé numérique, nous insistons sur l’importance de saisir ses limites, y compris les défis d’interprétation, l’exactitude des données et les algorithmes axés sur l’intelligence artificielle. Nous résumons les plus récentes recommandations du Groupe de travail sur les soins virtuels pour créer un cadre pancanadien. Finalement, nous proposons un modèle pour la mise en œuvre optimale des innovations en matière de santé numérique, lequel repose sur cinq principes, y compris la gestion des données, la sécurité des données, les biomarqueurs numériques, l’intelligence artificielle utile et l’intégration clinique.}

abstract = {Among the methodologies supporting new developments in sustainable problem identification and solution at the personal, organizational and social levels, the constellation techniques have gained increasing attention, offering tangible visualizations of system dynamics, learning in more detail about specific components, and thereby extracting valuable information knowledge in a specific topic. However, due to their complexity and interdisciplinary context, computational tools based on linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), perform a feasible approach to support data analysis and discussion. This study presents a systematic analysis and discusses the constellation-based techniques’ principles, applications, potentialities, and limitations. An exhaustive investigation was performed to collect relevant information on digital databases, and NLP was applied to extract and process data, such as geographical location, classification of knowledge area, keywords extraction, and sentiment perception. Results indicate an upward trend in developing new studies related to constellation techniques within almost 20 countries mentioned in the publications. An extensive predominance of family constellations in psychology, medicine, and public health (94.17%) and Law and legal systems (97.96%) was observed. Also, it seems the publications are highly focused on problem-solving (74.58%). Nonetheless, it was observed an apparent inconsistency between principles and applications in the various constellation techniques. Moreover, the aspects of reproducibility remain insufficiently explored, as well as the ethical issues from facilitators regarding the coherence on how the constellation technique principles are applied. Furthermore, it is feasible to notice the growth of scientific interest in this approach and its benefits as a sustainable support tool for diagnosing problems and possible solutions, as well as, the implementation of social change processes, increasing the perception of systemic relationships in complex environments. The application of this technique in decision-making processes has the potential to be further exploited. To reach this goal, there is the need to progress integrative studies associated with the development of computational tools providing more objective, valuable, and sustainable results for a systemic analysis.}

Existing systems are however often siloed in their approach and do not fully capture the complexity of brownfield sites from a sustainable development point of view. This critical review provides an insight into the development and implementation of DSSs, published and emerging, together with assessment of their strengths, limitations and opportunities for future integration. Brownfields DSS applications include: remediation technology selection; and land use planning; and risk assessment. The results of this review lead the authors to identify four opportunities to improve brownfield DSSs: (i) increased use of qualitative socioeconomic criteria, particularly costs and economic variables, (ii) decision-support during the early stages of brownfield redevelopment, (iii) the integration of predictive modelling methods, and (iv) improvements of user interfaces and modern web-based functionalities.}

The pandemic has had serious ramifications for K-3 education, and the impact of distance learning on 21st century skill attainment are important issues to explore. Using the Saudi Arabia context, this paper investigates teachers’ perspectives regarding the implementation of online education to support 21st century skills in the COVID-19 pandemic era for K-3 elementary school students. A qualitative research methodology was applied in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect data from five K-3 female teachers who implemented online education during the pandemic. Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills.}

The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners.}

The server power model is essential for thermal environment and energy efficiency. Due to the complication of the effects on power consumption of servers and few power models considering the inlet air temperature, this study firstly built an experimental setup to effectively facilitate the factor analysis. It then evaluated the effects of inlet air temperature and CPU utilization on server power consumption. During the experiment, the inlet air temperature was adjusted between 20 °C and 35 °C in 5 °C increments. Simultaneously, the SPECpower_ssj2008 was used to change the workload operations per second from 100% to idle, with a 10% interval. These measurements were also used in the server's various CPU power managements. When the inlet air temperature increases from 20 °C to 35 °C, the highest power increase was 17.60 W for Performance operating mode. Furthermore, in the DAPC and OS operating modes, the server power consumption has a piecewise linear relationship with its CPU temperature, and the function fits well when the CPU temperature is lower than 80 °C. For Performance and Workstation operating modes, the server power consumption is proportional to the temperature difference. The measurement-based correlation method employed by this paper can be used to investigate the power consumption model of other type or configured servers. If so, the adaptability of the model can be improved.}

Innovation is one such benefit that is expected nowadays in outsourcing engagements. The rising importance of innovation has been noticed and acknowledged not only in the Information Systems (IS) literature, but also in other management streams such as innovation and strategy. However, to date, these individual strands of research remain largely isolated from each other. Our theoretical review addresses this gap by consolidating and analyzing research on strategic innovation in the ITO and BPO context. The article set includes 95 papers published between 1998 and 2020 in outlets from the IS and related management fields. We craft a four-phase framework that integrates prior insights about (1) the antecedents of the decision to pursue strategic innovation in outsourcing settings; (2) arrangement options that facilitate strategic innovation in outsourcing relationships; (3) the generation of strategic innovations; and (4) realized strategic innovation outcomes, as assessed in the literature. We find that the research landscape to date is skewed, with many studies focusing on the first two phases. The last two phases remain relatively uncharted. We also discuss how innovation-oriented outsourcing insights compare with established research on cost-oriented outsourcing engagements. Finally, we offer directions for future research.}

abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated the building of resilient supply chains, and supply chain digitalization is gradually being recognized as an enabling means to this end. Nevertheless, scholars generally agree that more empirical studies will need to be conducted on how digitalization can facilitate supply chain resilience at various stages and enhance supply chain performance in a highly uncertain environment. To echo the call, this study develops a theoretical influence mechanism of “supply chain digitalization → supply chain resilience → supply chain performance” based on dynamic capability theory. The proposed relationships are validated using survey data collected from 210 Chinese manufacturing companies. The results help identify the paths digitalization and supply chain resilience can take to improve supply chain performance in a turbulent environment. The different roles of three supply chain resilience capabilities, namely absorptive capability (before the disruption), response capability (during the disruption), and recovery capability (after the disruption), which impact on supply chain performance differently, are highlighted. In addition, it is found that digitalization can bring a differential impact on these three supply chain resilience capabilities through different aspects of resource and structural adjustment measures. The findings also confirm the mediating role of absorptive capability, response capability, and recovery capability between digitalization and supply chain performance. During crisis, supply chain digitalization can increase cost-effectiveness, enhance information and communication efficiency, and promote supply chain resilience to achieve better performance. For theoretical contribution, this study enriches the research on supply chain digitalization and resilience by underpinning the relationships between the two with dynamic capability theory. For practical contribution, the research findings provide insights for enterprises to leverage digitalization to strengthen resilience in supply chain.}

Despite the fact that adopting cloud computing in the Saudi healthcare organizations can facilitate cost reduction, capacity building, institutional interoperability, and get access to data analytics, the adoption rate is very low. Hence, a new model is proposed to adopt cloud computing in the Saudi healthcare organization. The novelty of this work comes from using a quantitative method to test users’ attitudes, data security, data control, data privacy, compliance, and reliability influence on the cloud computing adoption intention in the context of Saudi Arabian healthcare organizations. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used for model development. About 160 respondents from the relevant health organizations participated. The result shows that the attitude towards using technology, data security, compliance, and reliability of the cloud computing services are important determining factors in the adoption of cloud computing in Saudi healthcare organizations. However, the distinction in the findings regarding Data privacy and Data control in the Saudi healthcare organizational context is a clear manifestation of the fact that there is a need for policy formation for data privacy, data control, and data protection legislation in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, raising awareness regarding the practice of data privacy and data control policies among IT managers is essential. Future study should use a more holistic and industry-specific framework such as the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to find new influencing factors from the domains of technological context, the organizational context, and the environmental context.}

To date, theorizing efforts in this space have focused on appraisal processes and nomological models that are designed to capture the responses to the security threats articulated within fear appeals. Because fear appeals are persuasive messages used to generate a sense of urgency about a specific threat that influences protective information security behaviors, they are an important focus in behavioral security research. However, we suggest that theoretical guidance is needed to facilitate further research in this area. We argue that ultimately, fear appeals are treatments intended to serve as catalysts of behavioral change. Therefore, fear appeals should have rhetorical validity, which is a specialized form of ecological validity in which contextualization has been included to ensure that the language embedded in the stimulus is consistent with the threat environment and the expectations of its audience. The rhetorical validity of a fear appeal should account for its exigence, the audience, and any constraints that shape the presentation and reception of the discourse. Using the illustrative example of a well-known behavioral security theory, protection motivation theory, this study provides a framework for behavioral security scholars in designing fear appeals that have rhetorical validity.}

Systems medicine is based on approaches taken from systems biology, omics research, bio-informatics and network theory. It promises to facilitate a better understanding of the causes of diseases, detection at an earlier stage, and the use of tailor-made approaches to prevention and therapy. This study provides information on how systems medicine could be incorporated into the German healthcare system.
Methods
In a Policy Delphi, consensus and divergence was elicited on whether experts believed systems medicine could be incorporated into the German healthcare system by 2030. Additionally, factors that could influence the implementation process were analysed. 11 theses on potential systems medicine developments and 193 arguments on influencing factors were evaluated. Experts from health and health-related fields were selected using “purposive sampling”.
Results
The experts interviewed expressed their trust in the provision of a legal-political framework, though they remained uncertain as to whether the necessary social discourse on the ethical and cultural questions surrounding systems medicine would occur. They do not (currently) expect systems medicine to be implemented by 2030.
Conclusion
Systems medicine is currently regarded as a visionary concept. As such, it would be premature to attempt to judge the success of the translation process at this stage. The results can help with the identification of the challenges involved in implementation, and the action required to achieve this aim.}

abstract = {Background
Hospital discharge is a ‘vulnerable stage’ in care. A delayed, inappropriate or poorly planned discharge increases hazards and costs, inhibiting recovery, and often leading to unplanned readmission. New discharge processes could boost practice, reduce the length of stay, and, consequently, reduce costs and improve patients' quality of life.
Aim
To identify technology based interventions that have been implemented to facilitate a safe and timely discharge procedure after elective surgery, and to describe implementation barriers and facilitators and patient satisfaction.
Method
This rapid review followed a restricted systematic review framework, searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov. for relevant studies published from 2015 to 2021 in English.
Results
Eleven studies were included. Most interventions were machine-learning-based, and only one study reported patient involvement. Effective leadership, team work and communication were stated as implementation facilitators. The main barriers to implementation were: lack of support from leaders, poor clinical documentation, resistance to change, and financial and logistical concerns. None of the studies evaluated patient satisfaction.
Conclusions
Findings highlight factors that support the implementation of technology based interventions aimed at a safe and timely discharge process following elective surgery. Nurses play an important role in the provision of information, and in the development and implementation of discharge processes.}

abstract = {In the manufacturing industry, a hydraulic system harnesses liquid fluid power to create powerful machines. Under the trend of Industry 4.0, the predictive maintenance of hydraulic systems is transforming to more intelligent and automated approaches that leverage the strong power of artificial intelligence and data science technologies. However, due to the knowledge-intensive and heterogeneous nature of the manufacturing domain, the data and information required for predictive maintenance are normally collected from ubiquitous sensing networks. This leads to the gap between massive heterogeneous data/information resources in hydraulic system components and the limited cognitive ability of system users. Moreover, how to capture and structure useful domain knowledge (in a machine-readable way) for solving domain-specific tasks remains an open challenge for the predictive maintenance of hydraulic systems. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a virtual knowledge graph-based approach for the digital modeling and intelligent predictive analytics of hydraulic systems. We evaluate the functionalities and effectiveness of the proposed approach on a predictive maintenance task under real-world industrial contexts. Results show that our proposed approach is capable and feasible to be implemented for digital modeling, data access, data integration, and predictive analytics.}

CLM covers manufacturers’ needs for complex configurable products, which tend to require more seamless integration of all their business units and external stakeholders in terms of process continuity and data exchange. CLM differs from existing life cycle management tools because it focuses on sharing the configuration knowledge and data of a configurable product throughout its entire life cycle across all the involved business units of an organization. Therefore, assessing the maturity level of the organization is important for more effective and efficient implementation of CLM. Based on this, the contribution of this research is the development of a CLM maturity model that serves as a guide for the transition to complete horizontal and vertical integration of CLM knowledge and tools across and beyond an organization. The proposed maturity model is validated against the literature and existing maturity models, in addition to being examined through a workshop with industry representatives and empirical cases.}

This exploration utilises the bootstrap full- and sub-sample techniques to investigate the connection between the blockchain market and carbon neutrality, which further evidences whether blockchain is a carbon-neutral facilitator or an environmental destroyer. The conclusions present that the blockchain index (BCI) exerts positive and negative influences on the carbon neutral index (CNI), which is following the STIRPAT model. The positive effects suggest that the rapid progress of blockchain technology accelerates the process of carbon neutrality and vice versa, underlining that blockchain is a carbon-neutral facilitator in China. But this view could not be supported by the negative impacts, primarily due to the public health event and national carbon policy helping to raise CNI even during the periods with low BCI. Conversely, CNI has a positive effect on BCI, revealing that achieving carbon neutrality in China requires the support of blockchain technology, which in turn promotes the development of the blockchain market. Under the new round of scientific and technological revolution, practical implications for China can be put forward to achieve carbon neutrality based on the above conclusions.}

abstract = {Context
Enterprise architecture (EA) is a collection of artifacts describing various aspects of an organization from an integrated business and IT perspective. EA practice is an organizational activity that implies using EA artifacts for facilitating decision-making and improving business and IT alignment. EA practice involves numerous participants ranging from C-level executives to project teams and effective engagement between these stakeholders and architects is critically important for success. Moreover, many practical problems with EA practice can be also attributed to insufficient engagement between architects and other EA stakeholders. However, the notion of engagement received only limited attention in the EA literature and the problem of establishing engagement has not been intentionally studied.
Objective
This paper intends to explore in detail the problem of achieving effective engagement between architects and other EA stakeholders in an organization, identify the main inhibitors of engagement and present a theoretical model explaining the problem of establishing engagement in practice.
Method
This paper is based on a single in-depth revelatory case study including nine interviews with different participants of EA practice (e.g. architects and other EA stakeholders) and documentation analysis. It leverages the grounded theory method to construct a conceptual model explaining the problem of engagement in the studied organization.
Results
This paper identifies 28 direct and indirect inhibitors of engagement and unifies them into a holistic conceptual model addressing the problem of achieving engagement that covers the factors undermining both strategic and initiative-based engagement between architects and other EA stakeholders.
Conclusions
This paper focuses on the notion of engagement and offers arguably the first available theoretical model that explains how typical engagement problems between architects and other stakeholders inhibit the realization of value from EA practice. However, the developed model has a number of limitations and we call for further empirical research on engagement problems in EA practice and coping strategies for addressing these problems.}

In order to obtain a reliable prediction, of the operation of a Sustainable Manufacturing System (SMS) and its Social Return (SR), this paper develops a methodology and procedures that allow predicting the system performance as a whole. This will allow us to assist management decision making in industries 4.0, supported by multi-criteria methods in knowledge management, simulation, value analysis and operational research by means of: a) Study the economic, social and environmental impacts in the organization and management of the efficient operation of an SMS with the selection of strategies and alternatives in production chains to minimize and / or mitigate environmental and labor risks. b) Encourage of industrial symbiosis or eco-industries networks that create opportunities increasing eco-efficiency and the positive social return of production systems. This proposed methodology will facilitate changes in the structure of production systems in order to implement industry 4.0 paradigms through facilitator technologies such as simulation and virtual reality. This framework will allow Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and other companies to address the decision-making activities that improve the economic-functional efficiency, which will lead to reduce the environmental impact and increase the positive social return of certain production strategies, considering working conditions. The proposed approach went validated, in the area of the Euroregion Galicia North of Portugal, to favour the implementation of the decision-making through the Industry 4.0 Technologies.}

First, digital finance development significantly boosts industrial structure upgrading in Chinese cities. The evidence remains valid after various robustness tests. Second, digital finance and industrial structure upgrading exhibit positive spatial spillover effects. Third, digital finance indirectly affects industrial structure upgrading through innovation, entrepreneurship and the structure of household consumption channels. Fourth, the influence of digital finance is more significant in cities with more developed economies, less financialization and lower income inequality. Finally, among the sub-indicators of digital finance, the breadth of coverage plays the most significant role, inspiring policymakers and financial institutions to speed up the digitization infrastructure in backward areas.}

The main goal of this paper is to examine the current state of smart mobility together with those factors that may influence the extent of modern sharing mobility proliferation and penetration through ICT applications and social media. The authors applied the content analysis using a sample of more than 1000 citizens' and visitors' reviews published on the official digital platforms of the smart city of Milan. The paper includes a comparison with data drawn from the public urban mobility services users. Based on the nodes resulting from the content analysis, the STEEP method was adopted in order to apply a more complex perspective concerning social, technological, environmental, economic and political issues. This strategic analytical tool was combined with the SWOT analysis dimensions to provide a comprehensive practical contribution to modern municipal smart mobility management systems. The results highlight the need for both smart mobility solutions suppliers and institutions to properly understand and communicate how digital services can be implemented across different users' touchpoints and communication channels to increase the value-added provided to citizens and visitors alike.}

Digital audits enhance the possibilities to ensure the production quality at the suppliers. A global supply chain quality integration is illustrated through the case of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner development. The development process was a major challenge for Boeing because not only several innovations were introduced in the 787 plane, but the supply chain quality integration reached new levels for the company. The 787-program had process, management, labor, and demand risks. The first 787 plane was delivered three years later than planned and the budget was exceeded by 10 billion USD. To solve the issues, Boeing created the Production Integration Center. It sent engineers and production workers to its suppliers in several countries of the world to smooth the supply chain quality integration. Boeing supported its suppliers with its knowledge. Onsite cameras were used as digital audits. The Production Integration Center intervened when it estimated delays in the shipments. Boeing successfully solved the issues, but they cost the company a lot. Examining this supply chain restructuring case can help supply chain managers to diagnose and overcome issues in supply chain quality integrations.}

To promote circular economy (CE) applications through resource recovery, this article investigates the feasibility of utilizing LFG as a sustainable energy to power data centers (DCs) in Xiamen (China) and evaluates the implications of waste heat reuse on the energy consumption of DC. The objective of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts and economic benefits of this scheme based on a SFC model. With respect to its novelty, LFG is utilized as an energy supply to DCs, while the waste heat generated in the energy production is recovered. The socio-economic benefits generated in this process are also elaborated. It was found that a large number of MSW was completely recycled to generate energy. The LFG enterprise could benefit from energy sale, while the energy satisfied the annual demand for DC power consumption. Utilizing this energy output resulted in the reduction of primary energy and less CO₂ emissions. By reusing the waste heat for domestic heating, the energy efficiency could be improved, while primary energy could be further saved, avoiding more CO₂ emissions. This implies that utilizing LFG output and waste heat to power DCs not only facilitate resource recovery from unused resources to improve energy efficiency and obtain socio-economic benefits, but also promote the digitalization of DCs and sustainable development of urban cities in the framework of CE.}

abstract = {The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation and automation. Advances in research fields of information technology and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM), machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning, computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1 presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2 introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals. Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4 examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and information integration throughout underground project lifecycle. Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps and future directions.}

abstract = {Maritime ports play a crucial role in the development of domestic and international trade and economies. Although near-port communities profit from economic benefits, there exist significant concerns regarding exposure to air emissions, which affect human health and climate change. To tackle this issue, a port authority can develop emission reduction plans and projects, whose performance is tracked through an air emissions inventory (EI). Despite the attention on EI methodologies in the past, little research has focused on the implementation of methodologies in information systems. Therefore, a case study is conducted in this paper to investigate the motivation for creating EIs and the obstacles in the EI-creation process from an information systems perspective. The results indicate that data confidentiality and weak information systems are major obstacles, which hinder the creation of high-quality EIs and generate additional costs. Our findings enable port stakeholders and decision makers to understand the current obstacles and facilitate the development of adequate information systems that support the creation of high-quality EIs.}

While the Metaverse promotes the social interaction between users, there is a scarcity of knowledge on what affects its social sustainability. Hence, this research develops a model by integrating the UTAUT2 constructs and big five personality traits to understand the social sustainability of the Metaverse. The model is tested by employing a hybrid covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) approach based on collecting data from 446 Metaverse users. The CB-SEM results showed that performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness significantly impact the social sustainability of the Metaverse, while no significant effect is reported regarding effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, conscientiousness, and extraversion. All these factors explained 80% of the variance in social sustainability. The ANN results showed that habit is the most important factor in predicting social sustainability. Drawing on these findings, the study offers several theoretical contributions and sheds light on several practical implications for developers, designers, and decision-makers promoting the use of the Metaverse.}

We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process.

Living laboratories are a popular smart city intervention that have the potential to address this power imbalance and empower citizens to influence smart city development. This research theoretically and empirically explores this role of living labs through a multiple-case study of urban living labs in the region of Catalonia. The findings uncover a ‘power banking’ mechanism which, coupled with other critical factors, facilitates the effectiveness of such initiatives. The considerable efforts required to engage citizens at a fairly basic level suggest that incorporating citizens into smart city models is more challenging than simplistic Quadruple Helix discourses convey.}

The analysis suggests that when common resources are at stake, ad hoc organizational solutions are needed at the field level, in addition to the traditional facilitating action at the project/group level, for SD modeling to succeed. Then, to address the fragilities of the existing approaches to participatory SD modeling, this study integrates concepts and solutions from institutional theories, adaptive co-management, and the body of knowledge on the (new) commons. A second causal loop diagram is provided to show how this new proposed approach could restructure the processes that link SD modeling inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts due to a higher-level permanent organizational unit with specific roles and data management capabilities labeled “smart commons organization”.

The rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and machine learning (ML) technologies hold promise for personalized, equitable cancer care and improved health outcomes within the context of cancer and beyond. Furthermore, integrating these technologies into cancer research has been effective in addressing many of the challenges for cancer control and cure. This can be achieved through the insights generated from massive amounts of data, in ways that can help inform decisions, interventions, and precision cancer care. AI, big data, and ML technologies offer, either in isolation or in combination, unconventional pathways that facilitate the better understanding and management of cancer and its impact on the person. The value of AI, big data, and ML technologies has been acknowledged and integrated within the Cancer Moonshot program in the U.S. and the EU Beating Cancer Plan in Europe.
Data Sources
Relevant studies on the topic have formed the basis for this article.
Conclusion
In a shifting health care environment where cancer care is becoming more complex and demanding, big data and AI technologies can act as a vehicle to facilitating the care continuum. An increasing body of literature demonstrates their impactful contributions in areas such as treatment and diagnosis. These technologies, however, create additional requirements from health care professionals in terms of capacity and preparedness to integrate them effectively and efficiently in clinical practice. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investment and training in oncology to combat and overcome some of the challenges posed by cancer control.
Implications for Nursing Practice
AI, big data, and ML are increasingly integrated in various aspects of health care. As a result, health care professionals, including nurses, will need to adjust in an ever-changing practice environment where these technologies have potential applications in clinical settings to improve risk stratification, early detection, and surveillance management of cancer patients.}

Health information technology can support the development of national learning health and care systems, which can be defined as health and care systems that continuously use data-enabled infrastructure to support policy and planning, public health, and personalisation of care. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public–private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public–private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.}

Citadel also incorporates network function virtualization (NFV) and service function chaining (SFC) to achieve flexible, cost-efficient, and proactive network defense. We examine CTI data to extract common attacker models and design security services as virtual network functions chained together using SFC to counter these threats. The modular and extensible nature of Citadel makes it suitable for incremental deployment in networks. Besides, we propose a new CTI data model to use as an extension of the existing CTI models for better compatibility with automated network defense. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposals are applicable and effectively facilitate the management of agile defense in SDN/NFV-enabled networks.}

Subsequently, the weight of finalized impacts and the performance score of finalized IDTs have simultaneously been measured via a novel version of Pythagorean fuzzy SECA (Simultaneously Evaluation of Criteria and Alternatives).

abstract = {In the quest to achieve sustainable development goals, developments in sustainability-oriented chemical process design are key to innovation in the chemical industry, especially important for processes aiming for sustainable fuels. One of the greatest challenges is the difficulty of modeling the highly complex interactions among the design variables, such as catalyst technology attributes, and greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the computational aids crucial to deal with the complexity of chemical processes require data that is either unavailable or uncertain at an early stage of design. The multistage integrated system for sustainable design proposed in this paper boosts these computational aids by applying data science techniques to allow uncertainty to be handled more efficiently, thereby facilitating the modeling of the interactions between the properties of new materials or processes and sustainability indicators. In this system, current data connectivity methods are used to find paths of correlation among catalysts properties and greenhouse gas emissions. The key feature of the proposed system relies on the integration through multiple stages of Fuzzy Inference systems and a data-driven technique for Emissions Analytics, FIEMA.11FIEMA: Fuzzy Inference and Emission Analytics. The algorithm in FIEMA provides a semi-supervised learning approach to emission analytics: it determines data clusters by a C-means algorithm and subsequently builds fuzzy sets for multiple stages of input–output inference. The proposed FIEMA system was demonstrated in an effort to determine the optimal configurations of the properties of catalysts to minimize the probability of associated greenhouse gas emissions for a methanol production process. The results showed the potential of this approach to reduce the search space of catalyst material designs by suggesting promising configurations for oxygen storage capacity, mechanical strength, lifetime, size, and poisoning level. The research impacts of this study contribute to the development of clean fuels by a computationally-efficient system for early design, and by the determination of catalysts development paths that assure an actual reduction of the life-cycle emissions.}

abstract = {Digitalisation in public transport has become pervasive over the past decade, especially in urban areas. While it benefits many, it also leaves some behind. Previous research shows that older adults, people with a lower education level, people with impairments and people with a migration background are more likely to be negatively impacted by digitalisation in transport services. In order to uncover mechanisms behind digital inequality in public transport, we interviewed 39 people belonging to these groups. They experience difficulties due to low digital skills, not using digital technologies on-the-go, not possessing the right devices and due to a complex design of technologies, among others. Many participants reap some benefits of digitalisation though. In fact, individuals can experience benefits on one aspect and difficulties on another. Nevertheless, experiencing difficulties with digitalisation does not necessarily equal to exclusion from public transport thanks to coping strategies like support from one's social network. Still, many coping strategies come with pitfalls such as hidden work and costs. Digital technologies facilitate a self-service approach that paradoxically makes some people more dependent on others. This study can support practitioners and researchers in developing a better understanding of the (sometimes insidious) consequences of technological innovations on individuals.}

This study integrates artificial intelligence technology, consumer engagement on social media, conversion rate optimization, and satisfying consumer experience to examine consumer repurchase intentions in the hospitality industry. Data was collected from 308 hotel customers from different regions of Oman who had an online hotel booking experience. SmartPLS was used to examine the data and proposed hypotheses. The findings of this study revealed that artificial intelligence technology positively influences consumer engagement on social media and conversion rate optimization. Similarly, consumer engagement on social media and conversion rate positively influence satisfying consumer experience, leading to increased consumer repurchase intentions. Finally, consumer habit positively moderates the relationship between satisfying consumer experience and repurchase intention. This study facilitated the understanding of artificial intelligence technology to influence consumer engagement on social media and conversion rate to boost consumer satisfaction and repurchase intention and offers suggestions for developing impeccable service business strategies. Marketers must think about making posts more interesting through videos, images, and animations, which will satisfy consumers, ultimately boosting their desire to use, share, and generate content on social media platforms for hospitality organizations.}

By drawing on the ‘Typology of digital social support’ framework, this paper presents rich insights into the intricacies of the underlying motivations, behaviour and help-seeking processes in the digital engagement of women in South African townships. The findings show that the women had the strong social embeddedness necessary for digital support and relied on a range of nuanced and cross-cutting support-seeking strategies, including formal and particularly informal support channels and, to a lesser extent, self-learning. This qualitative phenomenological study relies on in-depth individual interviews with a small sample of women in three South African townships. In revealing potential disparities between social support in developed and developing regions, the study affirms the need to prioritise further South African research and the development of theoretical frameworks grounded in local realities.}

We scrutinize how a manufacturer facilitates strategic change by realigning its strategic capabilities and processes from a focus on technical product-development capabilities to product-service-software development capabilities, reconfiguring organizational routines focused on efficiency to routines focused on customer productivity, and shifting from a product logic to a service logic. By studying six leading manufacturing firms based on 86 manager interviews, the present study finds that strategic capabilities are renewed through dynamic capabilities, which involve a reconfiguration of strategic capabilities and processes. Furthermore, manufacturers need to consider the dynamic interplay between resource realignment modes (building digital capabilities, leveraging existing capabilities, accessing external capabilities, and releasing decaying capabilities), hence stressing their reinforcing mechanism to converge products, services, and software. For managers, our study highlights several strategic renewal practices designed to assist and benchmark how strategic capabilities are altered.}

In the Industry 4.0 context, several terms are used to express the model, such as readiness assessment model, roadmap, framework, and maturity index. They have the same purpose of measuring how the current state of an organization unit is capable of adopting and implementing the concept of industry 4.0 in the future. Many researchers had proposed maturity models for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and maturity since 2011 when Industry 4.0 was commenced. However, there has been no attempt to analyze empirical evidence systematically. This paper aims to analyze currently available maturity models related to Industry 4.0 and provide a synthesis on those maturity models. This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies implemented on the maturity model published in several reputable and relevant sources. It focuses on the manufacturing and logistics sectors since the processes in both sectors can be highly improved through the introduction of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and artificial intelligence. In general, the primary purpose of the review is to address the following questions: (1) Based on what dimensions do researchers develop Industry 4.0 maturity models, and what are the most used and influencing parameters in those dimensions? (2) How do those maturity models compare to each other in terms of dimension complexity, techniques, maturity leveling, and kind of application sectors of the model? In conclusion, the maturity model in the context of Industry 4.0 is promising to guide the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies at the organization level. However, just having a maturity model is not enough. More efforts are needed to facilitate the application of it.}

abstract = {Background
In response to increasing emergency department presentations and wait times in Australia, multiple strategies and models of care have been implemented with varying results. One effective strategy has been the implementation of pre-hospital blood collection by paramedics when they insert an intravenous cannula. This research aims to determine the efficiency of and barriers to wider implementation of a pre-hospital blood collection trial in a regional context. In particular, to evaluate the impact of the pre-hospital blood collection on time to pathology results and error rates, and paramedic opinion.
Methods
This retrospective controlled cohort study was conducted over 12 months from August 2018. Emergency and pathology data were used to determine the haemolysis and error rates, as well as the time to result availability of pre-hospital blood collection samples compared to in hospital samples arrived by ambulance. To determine the facilitators and barriers to wider implementation a survey of 48 paramedics was conducted following completion of the 12-month trial. The survey was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, a behavior change theory associated with improved uptake when applied.
Findings
Overall 237 samples were collected. There was a 65% (51min) reduction in time taken for samples to be received at pathology and a 38% (50min) improvement in time taken for results to return from pathology for patients arrived by ambulance. There were no labelling errors in the pre-hospital blood collection group or change in haemolysis rates. The majority (79%) of paramedics who completed the survey were optimistic about the protocol improving patient outcomes and 89% regarded the change in practice as acceptable. Three main themes emerged: 1. Training, environmental challenges and adequate equipment; 2. increased efficiency and improved patient care and 3. Prerequisites to implementing a new practice. Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative data resulted in 10 key influencers of behavior that need to be addressed in any future implementation.
Conclusion and implications for practice
The introduction of pre-hospital phlebotomy reduced the time to blood results availability by 38% and resulted in fewer labelling errors. Wider implementation is supported by paramedics, but more training is required.}

abstract = {In pursuit of industrial digitalisation, the manufacturing industry is going through a transformation in the methods for product definition from the traditional two-dimensional drawing to three-dimensional digital model known as the model-based definition (MBD). The real benefit of this digitalisation lies in the adoption of model-based definition across all stages of the product lifecycles throughout the enterprise and its supply chain which is termed as model-based enterprise (MBE). However, the current application of this technology is partial, due to the involvement of several associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel framework for the management of uncertainties in the adoption of the model-based definition and presents a system in support of the proposed framework. The development commenced with the collaboration of two major aerospace industries. The framework comprises five phases including the preliminary phase, identification, assessment, analysis, and response phase. A systematic process is followed in developing the framework while Numeral, Spread, Assessment, and Pedigree (NUSAP), and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are used in the assessment of uncertainties. The developed system consists of a user interface, a database of uncertainties, an assessment module, an analysis and prioritisation module, and a knowledge base of mitigation strategies for key uncertainties. The system facilitates the analyst to select the relevant uncertainties from a defined list, systematically assess and analyse each of the uncertainty and obtain recommendations for mitigation of the prioritised uncertainties in the project. The framework and the developed system were validated through expert interviews with two world-class aerospace companies. This system facilitates identifying the various types of uncertainties of MBD, quantifying their impact on the project rationally, and formulating a suitable management strategy for achieving the status of a model-based enterprise.}

The model emphasizes the critical role of human capital as embodied in employees and their ever-shifting interaction with organizational culture to ensure the success of AI implementation. Since relationships remain the salient connections that bind organizations on value delivery, humans are and will remain critical to value-added activities and processes – even when those involve AI – underscoring the effect of the human interface on both economic and relational value for customers.}

Nowadays, gas turbines operate under transient conditions to support their renewable partners. Gas turbine dynamic performance simulation provides the means for assessing the engine behavior and designing engine controllers that will enable them to fulfill their new operating role. This paper presents a novel gas turbine performance system for representing the nonlinear behavior of a two-shaft gas turbine engine. The developed gas turbine engine model in MATLAB/Simulink environment is capable of simulating both steady state and transient operating conditions, and to facilitate the design of controllers for stable engine operation. Validation of the developed engine model with a gas turbine simulation package confirmed the excellent agreement among all the simulated measurements at transient conditions. The simulated behavior of a hybrid gas/wind power plant enabled the development of an optimized controller for empowering the gas turbine to support the intermittent wind turbines. The time responses of the main parameters of the hybrid gas/wind power plant demonstrated the significant amount of transient conditions that a gas turbine experiences for fulfilling the energy gap imposed by the wind turbines. Finally, the performance comparison of the hybrid power plant to a twin gas turbine power plant highlighted the effective reduction in NOx emissions.}

To synthesise the evidence on the roles and outcomes of change agents in facilitating the use of powered technology systems and devices for staff end-users in residential aged care workplaces.
Design
Systematic review and narrative synthesis.
Data sources
CINAHL, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published in English between January 2010 and July 2022.
Review methods
Two of three reviewers independently screened each title and abstract, and subsequently the full texts of selected records. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the included articles.
Results
Of 3,680 records identified, ten articles reporting nine studies were included. In all the studies, the change agent role was a minor component embedded within implementation processes. Three key change agent roles were identified: 1) providing guidance, expertise, and support with implementing a new technology; 2) delivering training to others, and 3) troubleshooting and responding to issues. The key outcome of change agent roles related to achieving project implementation milestones and higher levels of implementation of technology. Change agent processes, however, were compromised when the designated change agent role was included late in the implementation process, or was not supported, recognised, embraced, or when roles or responsibilities were unclear. The direct contribution of change agents was difficult to elucidate because the roles and outcomes of change agents were embedded in multi-faceted implementation strategies.
Conclusions
The change agent can play an important role in facilitating technology implementation by providing support, training, and troubleshooting. Challenges with the change agent role included unclear role expectations and appointment late in the implementation process. Overall, there was limited evidence specific to the role and outcome of the change agent role to inform ideal approaches for their role in technology facilitation for end-users in residential aged care workplaces.}

Findings indicate that agile adaptation and new opportunity utilization were the primary means of dealing with the disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic brought about. These findings indicate effective utilization of sensing and seizing capabilities and engagement with opportunity recognition and discovery to capture opportunities and deal with the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. The results further suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 triggered a fight-or-flight survival instinct among B2B SMEs due to unprecedented levels of market uncertainty. As such, the sensing capability of B2B SMEs allowed them to identify the market threats and opportunities and understand the prevailing market situation. Accordingly, B2B SMEs seized the identified threats and opportunities by reconfiguring their business models and face-to-face and online operations.

Open innovation (OI) is among the key strategic resources of enterprises, especially in high-tech sectors such as the ICT industry. The use of OI platforms and/or networks that facilitate access to and sharing of OI knowledge is gaining increasing interest. This study aimed to assess the factors motivating and hindering the use of OI platforms and/or networks in the ICT industry in Poland. The uniqueness of this approach lies in the use of a PROFIT analysis to develop proprietary models of the importance of the various motivating factors and barriers to the use of OI platforms and/or networks in the ICT industry in relation to the job position held. This study hypothesized that the knowledge of factors motivating and hindering the use of OI platforms and/or networks in the ICT industry varies across occupational groups. In order to verify the hypothesis and answer the formulated research questions, a diagnostic survey method with a survey technique was used. The results of this study confirm that the job position occupied by employees in the ICT industry is relevant to each of the factors that pose obstacles to their use of OI platforms and/or networks. Managers and management, as well as developers, are less likely to restrict the use of the aforementioned solutions due to organizational and/or administrative barriers, while more likely due to reluctance to share knowledge. For specialists and analysts, legal barriers and NIH syndrome are greater obstacles. For programmers, negative attitudes toward open innovation and lack of internal commitment to the company are less of an obstacle. Insufficient support from top management is a major barrier for administrative staff and programmers. The conclusions formulated can be useful in practice for managers in the ICT industry to make optimal use of access to OI.}

abstract = {Recent advances in robotics and digital technologies in the automotive industry, allow the integration of vehicle systems with their virtual twins, thus facilitating their modelling and optimization. As a result, the systems design time and manufacturing costs are substantially reduced, while their performance, safety and fatigue life are expanded. This work presents a multiobjective optimization framework for developing an optimal design of a front double wishbone vehicle suspension system based on a four-bar mechanism. This is carried out by coupling several computer-aided design tools (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software. The 3D CAD model of the lower control arm of the suspension system is made using SolidWorks®, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the suspension assembly is modelled using ANSYS® Workbench, while the multibody kinetic and dynamic of the designed suspension system is analysed using MSC ADAMS®. They are embedded in a multidisciplinary optimization design framework (modeFrontier®) with the aim of determining the optimal hardpoint locations of a lower control arm by minimizing the chassis pitch accelerations to improve the passengers’ comfort, reducing the volume and mass of the suspension system to increase the vehicle stability and manoeuvrability, while decreasing the maximum stresses to extend the system fatigue life and enhancing safety. The methodology has been successfully applied to several driving scenarios entailing different vehicle dynamics manoeuvres with the aim to find the Pareto optimal front, and to analyse the suspension assembly performance together with the vehicle dynamic behaviour. Results show that the use of such approach may significantly improve the design of the suspension system. Furthermore, a comparison of different optimization strategies and algorithms is performed.}

The promise of CE is to change the conventional “take–make–dispose” that causes massive waste flows based on the integration of demanufacturing and remanufacturing processes within value chains. This integration requires breaking the ”silos” of the circular chain to establish new collaborative and sustainable value networks. The paper introduces a novel digital platform for the CE, which is currently under development in the H2020 DigiPrime project. The platform is destined to facilitate seamless and trusted information exchange across circular actors, while offering a range of value-added services that enable manufacturers, remanufactures, recyclers and other actors to gain insights in the status of recycling and waste management processes. The latter facilitates the implementation of zero waste processes, along with the assessment of the performance of the circular chain. The paper introduces the architecture of the digital platform, along with its data modelling, exchange and data traceability mechanisms. It also presents a CE use case used to validate the platform.}

This framework has evolved toward having smart CPS with intelligence and decision-making capabilities and highly networked and integrated components. CPSs have been categorized into two types namely Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) for the development of products and Cyber Physical Service Systems (CPSS) for the servicing of products. These developments facilitate the adoption of the CPS in smart cities, smart farming systems, smart manufacturing, and smart supply chain systems, etc., while it gives CPS the importance as one of the core technologies making up Industry 4.0 era. Despite these advances, cybersecurity and privacy, real-time control of systems, interoperability of services, etc. are key challenges facing the development of CPS and they demand solutions overcoming such challenges.

Digital twin (DT) is the technical core for establishing CPPS in the context of industry 4.0. Developing an easy-to-deploy and simple-to-use DT-based CPPS is a critical research gap. In this paper, a systemic framework is proposed to provide guidelines for rapid system configuration and easy runtime of DT-based CPPS by integrating CPS, DT modeling technologies, event-driven distributed cooperation mechanisms, and web technologies. The concept of CPS node (CPSN) for manufacturing resources is established by integrating semantic information model, 3D geometric model and function modules. Various CPSNs are orchestrated as an autonomous CPPS using dynamic resource registration and binding technologies. To achieve easy runtime of DT-based CPPS, event-driven distributed cooperation among CPSNs and web-based remote control of CPPS are proposed respectively. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the proposed framework, a prototype of DT-based CPPS is implemented, based on which an exemplary case is conducted.}

To promote data sharing, this study intends to understand the strategies of both platform enterprises and participants based on a dynamic game model to provide policy implications to platform enterprises and the government. The main findings are as follows. First, when platform enterprises move first, they should subsidize key participants with high privacy costs to compensate for the negative externality of data. Second, in the early stages of building a platform, when supporting platform enterprises move first, they must subsidize both key participants with low privacy costs and general participants. Third, governments must introduce regulations and laws to govern the delimitation of data property rights.}

Furthermore, the study investigated contingencies that may modify the relationship between leadership communication and followers’ outcomes. Results from an online panel of 417 U.S. employees showed that top leaders’ use of charismatic rhetoric during change led to followers’ affective commitment to change, which decreased their turnover intention. Furthermore, employees’ organizational identification moderated this relationship. When employees have low identification with their organizations, top leaders’ charismatic rhetoric to address the immediate change is more needed.}

The Internet of Things is one of the biggest ecosystems that is bringing innovations encompassing digital solutions in almost every sector. On the other hand, the Building Information Modeling approach allows for data sharing among stakeholders, traceability, and the integrated management of the building or infrastructure life-cycle through a 3D informative virtual model. Our study reviews existing research works and technological solutions that integrate these two important topics to enhance the sustainability of the built environment, making it smarter. The presented review analyses the existing papers available in literature from January 2015 to December 2020, to present the best practices in this integration and discuss limitations of the identified solutions. Based on the outcomes of the analysis and aiming at the creation of a solid knowledge basis for the community interested in the sector, a comprehensive modular architecture has been proposed. Finally, new directions for future works are presented by discussing how the proposed architecture can actually facilitate the design and development phases.}

Founded on the dynamic capability view, our paper empirically tests how firms utilize their digital and creative capabilities to improve their performance during the pandemic and promote their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. The study conducted a two-step analysis. First, the data from 151 enterprises in Vietnam was collected and analyzed qualitatively to understand their digital capabilities and export performance. Then, the Smart PLS version 3 was utilized to analyze extended quantitative data of 329 SMEs in various industries. This study contributes to the theories of dynamic capability with the implications of developing digital and creative capabilities to enhance performance and CSR differentiation strategy in dealing with external challenges, especially in global pandemics. Firm performance plays a mediating role in the relationship between capabilities and CSR differentiation strategy. Our study also enriches the CSR literature by viewing CSR as firms' achieved targets or voluntary activities instead of as an instrument to boost firm performance.

As a value co-creation strategy, the innovative design of smart PSS involves multiple stakeholders, and the decisions in the concept design stage are especially crucial for its success throughout the whole lifespan. However, recent studies have focused on developing the design methodology or decision approaches for it, with an absence of the systematic decision framework for smart PSS innovation design. Most of them held the customer-centric viewpoint without considering the aspect of multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation. To fill the gaps, this study proposes the UNISON framework of model-based innovation for smart PSS design from the perspective of collaborative innovation, to assist its innovative design and decision-making in the concept design stage. To illustrate the structured procedures and demonstrate the validity of this framework, it was applied in an empirical study for the innovative design of smart drainage equipment-service system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed framework has been discussed from both theoretical and practical aspects. This study can provide systematic guidance for developing smart PSS innovative design strategies to facilitate multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation.}

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.}

International climate finance stands to benefit in particular ways from these new opportunities in financial technology. Distributed ledger technologies could be leveraged to support climate action, for example by facilitating transparent and standardized transactions, or by enabling more efficient monitoring and accreditation processes. In view of these promising opportunities, we focus our inquiry on the case of the Green Climate Fund to explore how distributed ledger technologies can be used for innovative climate finance. Based on our analysis of different digital system models and potential use cases, we then discuss some of the technical and political challenges that may arise, for example with regard to standards and safeguards, governance processes, country ownership, and further capitalization. Our findings show that distributed ledger-based systems could benefit the work of the fund in key areas such as multi-stakeholder coordination and impact assessment. However, our analysis also points to the concrete limitations of technology driven solutions. Digital technologies are not a standalone solution to persistent resource allocation and governance challenges in international climate finance, especially because the design and deployment of these digital systems is inherently political.}

In the domain of land administration, like others, the process is challenging: complex laws and regulations, lengthy process descriptions, shared organisational responsibilities, differing information encodings and formats, and seeking compliance with the LADM ISO 19152 standard, must be considered. Between 2016 and 2018, The Netherlands’ Cadastre, Land Registry and Mapping Agency – in short, Kadaster – successfully undertook the renewal of the information system supporting its deeds registration. The previous system dated back to the 1980s. In-house data modelling specialists led the program, the most extensive undertaken in decades. Inspired by action-research principles, the process and resultant lessons are documented using a case study approach. It is shown that beyond Model Driven Architectures, other model-driven methodologies, such as Domain-Driven Design, are entirely useful in the land administration domain. A domain is usually more extensive than a few objects, and to make it more manageable, DDD divides a domain into subdomains. The DDD term ‘problem domain’ is used to define a functional area within a context such as an organisation or department. The terms domain in DDD and LADM have common characteristics as considering contexts such as a land registry and a cadastre. Evans (2003) and Vernon (2013) articulate how DDD is a set of design practices, techniques and fundamental principles, terms, and implications to facilitate the development of software projects within complex domains, used to guide software developers and domain experts to share and represent models of knowledge from the domain. In DDD, the ubiquitous language is also essential in intersecting the jargons between domain experts and IT experts. The LADM provides a formal language for describing similarities and differences for describing the many aspects of the land administration domain. The approach demands greater participation from domain experts: they lead modelling of the current state and its evolution: the events. The Annex N of ISO 19152 describes that LADM covers both event-based and state-based modelling via LA_Source and VersionedObject. The application of Event-Based Modelling and Event Sourcing is still relatively novel to the LA domain. Event Sourcing ensures that all current state changes are stored as a sequence of events, enabling querying and state reconstruction. The new information system is considered futureproof, delivering improvements for deed registration times, monitoring, traceability/auditing, history management and interoperability. Further research suggestions include undertaken Domain-Driven Design in other contexts, particularly those implementing LADM.}

This research innovatively calculates ICT capital in China from 2001 to 2018 and explores how ICT capital affects carbon emission efficiency and its spatial spillover effects from a digital investment perspective. The empirical results prove that ICT capital contributes to improvement of carbon emission efficiency, pure technical efficiency, scale efficiency and technological progress. Furthermore, interestingly, ICT communication capital was found to have the strongest effect on improving carbon emission efficiency, while ICT hardware capital and software capital have a weaker effect. The spatial effect demonstrates that ICT capital not only helps improve the local carbon emission efficiency but also has spatial spillovers to the surrounding areas and has the most prominent effect on the carbon emission efficiency of the central region. The mediation tests illustrate that ICT capital improves carbon emission efficiency by promoting technological innovation, alleviating industrial structure distortions, enhancing resource allocation efficiency and accelerating human capital accumulation. These findings have important policy guiding significance for the region to stimulate the potential of ICT capital and facilitate the low-carbon transformation of the economy.}

abstract = {Summary
This article outlines the need for, and possible solutions to the problem of third parties’ legally untrammelled ability to collect and use identified or identifiable personal, sometimes very sensitive, health data. A solution would be implementation of a comprehensive legal framework – from international treaties through national legislation to operationalising data privacy and ethics by design at the level computer software (algorithmic) instructions. At least since the last decade of the twentieth century, digitisation of health data and creation of national electronic health records infrastructure has held the promise of enabling the attainment of such public health goals as personal health management, health care delivery, health-related research, and population health surveillance. Great advances in Big Data technology, and even more so, the algorithmic revolution, has facilitated these four goals, though not necessarily in the ways envisaged by scholars and policy-makers of the time. Thus, personal health management is supported by apps such as Apple Health; telemedicine and teleradiology systems enable health care delivery to patients wherever they are located. Health-related medical, commercial, socio-economic and socio-political research based on Big Data is booming, while national electronic health record systems allow national and international agencies to track and scrutinize health of individuals and populations. However, unregulated and rampant “datafication” of identified or identifiable personal health information about individuals collected, managed, and disseminated without their knowledge and informed consent effectively treats data subjects – us – as mere means to an end. The law has been lagging a long way behind technical and commercial development, yet it is possible to safeguard privacy and other fundamental rights of data subjects. For example, as part of the European Union's Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Parliament adopted Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the “protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data”, and the Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the “protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data”. The Regulation shall apply, and the Directive will enter into force (requiring EU Member States to transpose it into their national law) in May 2018. In the United Kingdom, the Investigative Powers Act (UK) 2016 has systemically incorporated approach to statutory controls in form of proportionality and necessity tests on powers that national security and law enforcement agencies must intercept, communications, access, collect and manage massive volumes of data (known as “bulk powers”). These controls aim to create privacy safeguards for intentionally or inadvertently targeted individuals. Thus, the law seems to be “awakening”. However, a comprehensive and systematic regulatory framework of controls and protections is yet to be postulated. This article outlines an approach consisting of vertical tiers that can be implemented separately or in total. The article has two parts. The first part provides background to the interface between developments in technology and unconsented to “datafication” of our personal health from which, unbeknown to us, third party algorithms create our digital identity. The second part outlines proposal that envisages a five-tier legal framework for protection of identifiable personal health data. Protections at each tier would be discrete yet capable of integration. At the base – the design level – it possible for software engineers and computer programmers to specify precisely defined algorithmic instructions for processing personal data in accordance with privacy laws and ethical standards. At the next level – data operators and/or analysts (whether human or an automated algorithmic program) – legal tests of proportionality and necessity and ethical conduct could be implemented by legislation and embedded in the algorithm design. At the third level – individuals and organizations storing and using the data – responsibility for its integrity and security as well as privacy and ethics could be governed by legislation. At the top level, international treaties could provide for uniform standards and approach.
Résumé
Cet article étudie le problème et propose des pistes de solutions au problème de tierces personnes ayant la capacité, légalement incontrôlable, d’accumuler et d’utiliser des données identifiées ou identifiables, parfois très confidentielles, sur la santé. Une des solutions qui s’offre serait la mise en place d’un cadre réglementaire exhaustif – des traités internationaux, en passant par la législation nationale, puis à la mise en place d’un système de données confidentielles et d’éthique à partir d’un logiciel d’instruction (algorithmique). Depuis au moins la dernière décennie du vingtième siècle, la digitalisation des données sur la santé et la création de dossiers de santé en ligne à l’échelle nationale permettent d’atteindre des objectifs de santé publique tels la gestion de la santé personnelle, la prestation de soins, la recherche en santé et la surveillance de la santé de la population. Les avancées dans la technologie des mégadonnées, et qui plus est, la révolution algorithmique, a facilité l’accomplissement de ces quatre objectifs, quoique d’une façon différente à celle envisagée par les chercheurs et les responsables politiques de l’époque. En effet, la gestion de la santé personnelle est encouragée par des applications comme Apple Health ; des systèmes de télémédecine et de téléradiologie permettent la livraison de soins aux patients n’importe où. Les recherches médicale, commerciale, socioéconomique et sociopolitique liées à la santé et basées sur les mégadonnées sont en plein essor, alors que des systèmes nationaux de dossiers de la santé électroniques permettent aux agences nationales et internationales de tracer et d’examiner la santé des individus et des populations. Cependant, la « datafication » non réglementée et rampante d’information personnelle sur la santé des individus qui est accumulée, gérée et diffusée sans qu’ils ne le sachent et sans leur consentement traite les sujets de ces données – nous – comme le simple moyen une finalité autre. Le droit a pris du retard face aux développements techniques et commerciaux, mais il demeure possible de protéger la confidentialité et autres droits fondamentaux des sujets de ces données. À titre d’exemple, dans le cadre de la stratégie pour un marché unique numérique de l’Union européenne, le Parlement européen a adopté le règlement (UE) 2016/679 relatif à la « protection des personnes physiques à l’égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel et à la libre circulation de ces données » et la directive (UE) 2016/680 relative à la « protection des personnes physiques à l’égard du traitement des données à caractère personnel par les autorités compétentes à des fins de prévention et de détection des infractions pénales, d’enquêtes et de poursuites en la matière ou d’exécution de sanctions pénales, et à la libre circulation de ces données ». Le règlement s’applique et la directive entrera en vigueur (lorsque les membres de l’UE auront transposé cette loi dans leur loi nationale) en mai 2018. Au Royaume-Uni, l’Investigatory Powers Act (UK) 2016 a systématiquement incorporé une approche à ce contrôle statutaire par l’entremise de tests de proportionnalité et de nécessité sur les pouvoirs conférés à la sécurité nationale en matière d’interception, de communication, d’accès, de collection et de gestion de quantité massive de données (connus sous le nom de « Bulk powers »). Ce contrôle a pour but de créer des mesures appropriées pour la protection de la vie privée pour les individus qui sont intentionnellement ou involontairement ciblés. Ainsi, le droit semble s’éveiller. Toutefois, un cadre réglementaire exhaustif et systématique de contrôle et de protection n’a pas encore été instauré. Cet article propose une approche en étages verticaux qui pourraient être mis en œuvre séparément ou ensemble. Cet article est divisé en deux parties. La première partie donne de l’information sur l’interface entre les développements en technologie et notre non-consentement à la « datafication » de notre santé personnelle, à partir de laquelle, à notre insu, les algorithmes de tierces parties créent notre identité digitale. La deuxième partie émet une proposition qui envisage un cadre légal en quatre temps pour la protection des données identifiables sur la santé. Les protections à chaque étage seraient discrètes mais capables d’intégration. À la base – au niveau de la conception – il est possible pour les ingénieurs informatiques et les programmeurs informatiques de spécifier des algorithmes d’instructions définis de façon précise pour traiter les données personnelles conformément aux lois sur la confidentialité et les standards éthiques. Au niveau suivant – les opérateurs de données et les analystes (humains ou un programme algorithmique automatisé) – des tests légaux de proportionnalité et de nécessité et de conduite éthique pourraient être mis en place par la législation et intégrés dans la conception algorithmique. Au troisième niveau – les individus et organisations qui stockent et utilisent – la responsabilité de l’intégrité, la sécurité ainsi que la confidentialité et l’éthique pourraient être gouvernés par la législation. Et au plus haut niveau, les traités internationaux pourraient établir des standards et une approche uniformes.}

The application of novel technologies such as pervasive sensing, widespread internet of the things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics aims to sense, calculate, and actuate by employing data-driven architectures and automated decisions for reaching more efficient processes that reduce environmental impacts and transform manpower workloads. This work introduces a cyber-physical system (CPS) towards more innovative operations within the mining industry’s mine-to-mill process, whereby the operations’ decision-making and executions are often done by human intelligence. However, the increasing use of autonomous machines or mechatronics (MEC) such as trucks, drills, drones, and conveyor belts, combined with advanced modelling and solving algorithms (MSA), can achieve the necessary autonomous operations for handling such hazards and harsh environments, where no or reduced manpower is required. For that, information and computing technologies (ICT) facilitate innovative solutions to re-shape and re-design production systems. The interplaying of advanced technologies of the I4 mandate and circular economy (CE) ideology towards the mines of the future creates a smart connected mining industry that embeds vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent systems. This paper discusses how I4’s technological developments in mining sector applications generate opportunities to re-design and re-execute stockpiling to conveyor-belt processes into enhanced production states from a CE perspective (environmental, economic, and social). CE theories within I4-S5 offer innovative sustainable industrial concepts driven by safer, more environmentally friendly towards precision and autonomous mining.}

Based on qualitative research methods, this study analyzes pandemic prevention policy documents issued during the pandemic by China's national economic and technological development zones and their localities to reflect the complete process of governance. The findings indicate that a mandatory policy network, guided by a local governance framework, facilitated the rapid achievement of collaboration in development zones in responding to the crisis. Top-down leadership developed over time in the public sector, and the responsiveness and innovation of enterprises and social organizations played an important role in collaborative governance. Wins at each stage of the governance process are necessary for the continuation of collaborative actions and can drive the adaptation of a collaborative approach in development zones.}

The aim of this research is to develop a framework for the integration of BIM and structure verification to improve the application of BIM in road engineering and thus reduce the mistake and repetition in pavement design. Relying on the capabilities of Dynamo, a three-dimensional road model with pavement controllable parameters was first established. Successful implementation of this step can facilitate the designer with more flexible and convenient needs in design process. Secondly, a subroutine is developed based on Python to combine Dynamo with the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) which provides the pavement structure analysis. As a response to long-term development between BIM and road engineering, this paper contributes by offering innovative and practical solutions for integration of road design and pavement analysis, which effectively solves the long-existing defect that the pavement structure cannot be analyzed in the environment of BIM, and thus, will significantly promote the further application of BIM technology in the road industry.}

More specifically, the simulation space provided by the Digital Twin can facilitate engineers in the process of information fusion derived from the virtual model of the product (i.e. conceptual model), knowledge gathered from the usage of the physical products as well as from information provided by the customers during the design of a new product. On the other hand, Extended Reality (XR) applications, including Virtual Reality (VR) can facilitate engineers in developing intuitive applications for capturing end-users’ knowledge through the interaction with the holograms displayed on their field of view, i.e. the physical space. Moreover, with the utilization of VR, engineers are capable of visualizing the simulation results from the Digital Twin and collaborate with their colleagues for improving new product designs. Towards this direction, the contribution of this research work is focused on the design and development of a framework for including customers in the design phase of new products under the mass personalization paradigm. The Digital Twin of the new product will accept as input information regarding the user-defined requirements, as well as data from previous similar design cases. Through the development of a VR application, engineers can visualize the simulation results and remotely collaborate during the design of new products. Finally, the development of an Augmented Reality (AR) application for the requirement elicitation from customers and the visualization of simulation results is provisioned.}

The new generation of Southeast Asian Chinese society, who were locally born and grew up, have largely weakened their interaction with China. However, the growing business opportunities presented from the Belt and Road Initiative (the BRI), which was launched in 2013, serve as a big impetus for the new generation entrepreneurs to reengage China. Drawn upon an empirical case study of the new generation of Malaysian Chinese entrepreneurs, this paper argues that, the entrepreneurs regard institutional embeddedness as a critical channel to enhance their abilities to accumulate transnational social capital and strengthen their socio-economic networks with China. The transnational networks facilitate them to seize business opportunities from the BRI, and simultaneously reinforce their Malaysian national identity. Moreover, this study demonstrates the emergence of knowledge networks in the transnational space. It not only reflects the increasing interests of the new generation entrepreneurship in China's innovation and technology, but also reveals the developmental strategies of both the Malaysian and Chinese states.}

The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda. Critical perspectives are also offered for future practitioners.}

Although blockchain and machine learning technologies (especially deep learning and deep reinforcement learning) may provide the next promising use case for IIoT, they are working in an adversarial way to some extent. While blockchain facilitates the data collection that is critical for machine learning under the premise of data regulation rules like privacy protection, it may suffer from privacy leakage due to big data analytics with the help of machine learning. To make machine learning and blockchain useful and practical for diversified services in industrial sectors, it is of paramount importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the development of both technologies in the context of IIoT. To this end, in this paper we summarize and analyze the applications of blockchain and machine learning in IIoT from three important aspects, i.e., consensus mechanism, storage and communication. This survey provides a deeper understanding on the security and privacy risks of the key components of a blockchain from the perspective of machine learning, which is useful in the design of practical blockchain solutions for IIoT. In addition, we provide useful guidance for future research in the area by identifying interesting open problems that need to be addressed before large-scale deployments of IIoT applications are practicable.}

These obstacles will be overcome by generating a digital twin using a scan of the shop floor and subsequent object recognition. This paper describes the approach with multiple steps, parameters, and data which must be acquired in order to generate a digital twin automatically.

To ensure potential affordances are leveraged and potential limitations and risks are identified and addressed, a structured approach for identifying opportunities and challenges for people, plant and procedures could be beneficial. A literature review revealed that for process safety management there is a gap associated with exploring the utility of frameworks that facilitate a structured approach for thinking about data, information, knowledge and wisdom from a people, plant and procedures perspective. This article explores work done to answer the research question – Can the data-information-knowledge-wisdom-action (DIKWA) cycle and people-plant-procedures (P3) model help identify important considerations associated with ‘Big Data’ applications within the process industries especially in terms of process safety management? We apply these frameworks to an industry case study on high temperature hydrogen attack and find that it revealed insights into options for and affordances and limitations associated with adopting ‘Big Data’ technology and tools. The implications of these insights for process safety management are discussed then recommendations are made about future research which includes the need to use this work to inform the development of a useful and usable knowledge processing model for process safety applications.}

Our aim is to examine the socio-political and health issues that stem from using AI-CAD technology in a global health context conceptualized as a set of practice and ideas organizing global intervention “in the life of others”. We also question how this technology, which is not yet fully implemented in routine use, may limit or amplify some inequalities in the care of tuberculosis. We describe AI-CAD through Actor-Network-Theory framework to understand the global assemblage and composite activities associated with detection through AI-CAD, and interrogate how the technology itself may consolidate a specific configuration of “global health”. We explore the various dimensions of AI-CAD “health effects model”: technology design, development, regulation, institutional competition, social interaction and health cultures. On a broader level, AI-CAD represents a new version of global health's accelerationist model centered on “moving and autonomous-presumed technologies”. We finally present key aspects in our research which help discuss the theories mobilized: AI-CAD ambivalent insertion in global health, the social lives of its data: from efficacy to markets and AI-CAD human care and maintenance it requires. We reflect on the conditions that will affect AI-CAD use and its promises. In the end, the risk of new detection technologies such as AI-CAD is indeed that the fight against TB could be reduced to one that is purely technical and technological, with neglect to its social determinants and effects.}

abstract = {Developing knowledge-based and usable climate change policies requires establishing science-policy interfaces through which knowledge producers and policymakers cooperate. Current research reveals that co-production-based interfaces dominated neither by knowledge producers nor policymakers succeed in facilitating the transformation of knowledge into politics. From this point of view, this paper explores how Izmir Development Agency (IZKA), a regional development agency in Turkey, utilizes scientific knowledge and science-policy interfaces in its activities on climate change. Based on the analysis of agency documents and semi-structured interviews with experts from and outside IZKA, the findings indicate that IZKA thrives in integrating scientific knowledge on climate change in its activities drawing from multi-stakeholder and multi-level science-policy interfaces that have significant similarities with the co-production model. In these interfaces, international, national, regional, and local stakeholders share their resources, knowledge, and experience on climate change. Although legal, geographical, and demographic conditions also have an impact, the main reason behind IZKA’s success is the agency’s climate-focused vision that shapes decisions, strategies, organizational structure, and activities. In parallel to the indicated finding, this paper also discloses that the perspective of not prioritizing climate change and considering the potential benefits as only “co-benefit” does not yield results with the desired efficiency. Another finding is that even though the national government is the main actor on climate in Turkey, development agencies are capable of carrying out transformative activities in their regions, albeit limited.}

Urban sustainability works as a vision providing a long-term outlook of urban development, while urban health provides a context for individuals to live comfortably and communities to thrive. Both concepts have an enormous impact on all aspects of life, not in the least quality of life. This chapter provides a brief history to prove the challenge of health and well-being in the built environment. It provides a strong integration of sustainability and health with intelligence as this is needed in the years ahead. The combination of urban intelligence and digital twins as a planning tool to optimize the performance of cities and communities coveys the message that urbanization requires artificial intelligence by using smart technologies and data-driven planning solutions to enhance human and nature intelligence, not to replace them. This approach requires a holistic partnership that promotes human-centric design and intelligence into the built environment to address infrastructure challenges in cities and facilitate sustainability, health, pandemic response, adaptability, therapy, and knowledge.}

However, it has been a long-standing challenge due to the complex building shading effects and diversified rooftop availabilities. To overcome the challenge, this study proposed a novel 3D-geographic information system (GIS) and deep learning integrated approach, in which a 3D-GIS-based solar irradiance analyzer was developed to predict dynamic rooftop solar irradiance by taking shading effects of surrounding buildings into account. A deep learning framework was developed to identify the rooftop availabilities. Experimental validations have shown their high accuracies. As a case study, a real urban region of Hong Kong was used. The results showed that the annual solar energy potential of the entire building group was reduced by 35.7% due to the shading effect and the reduced rooftop availability. The reductions of individual buildings varied from 13.4% to 74.5%. In spite of the substantial reductions of the annual solar energy, the shading effect could only slightly reduce the peak solar power. In fact, the annual solar energy reduction could be five times higher than the peak solar power reduction. Further analysis showed that simple addition of the respective solar energy potential reductions, caused by the shading effect and the rooftop availability, tends to highly overestimate the total reduction by up to 26%. For this reason, their impacts cannot be considered separately but as joint effects. The integrated approach provides a viable means to accurately characterize rooftop solar energy potential in urban regions, which can help facilitate solar energy applications in high-density cities.}

We employ a comparative case study of open government data platforms in three leading Latin American cities and draw upon the concept of boundary resources taken from platform theory. Our research generates two key contributions. First, we propose a theoretical model, which explains how an OGD platform owner is able to govern the demand and the supply side of its platform to facilitate the cultivation of a platform ecosystem. Second, we develop contributions to practice in terms of a set of recommendations for governments in emerging countries concerning how to establish and manage a vibrant OGD platform ecosystem.}

The SISE development requires considering the service requirement from both the complex industrial context and service ecosystem manners. This study proposes a systematic framework for stakeholder requirement evaluation in SISE. The first part of the framework is the industrial context-viable system model with ecological thinking (IC-VESM) to elicit the service requirements for the SISE, which facilitates a systematic analysis of the service value proposition and service requirement elicitation in the operational lifecycle of an entire industrial context. This second part of the framework proposes a method for evaluating service requirements that is both feasible and systematic. This is achieved by combining the Fuzzy Kano and AHP methods in a Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) environment. The PF Kano computes the categories and determines the weights of service requirements from a consumer perspective, while the PF AHP hierarchically analyzes the service requirements and provides pairwise comparison paths for design experts. Finally, an illustrative case study in a renewable energy context was used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. The proposed theoretical model provides more reliable and systematic outcomes than traditional methods when eliciting service requirements and evaluating complex smart industrial service solutions. The study has practical implications by providing useful insights for companies to recognize key smart service requirements in complex industrial contexts and to improve sustainable development.}

The Information Systems literature primarily ascribes the controversies to resistance to technology. By adopting the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) as a learning process for understanding port stakeholders' relations and attitudes, we explore the controversies to determine the meanings port stakeholders attribute to them. We combined SSM with interviews, media content analysis and focus groups made possible by snowballing. The responses were analyzed using rich pictures and validated through a conceptual model. The results reveal a fragmented government where ministries, agencies, and personalities assert power in single window implementation through I.T. vendor contracts. The situation results in a high cost of doing business at the port for shippers due to non-transparent and questionable contracts. The public’s attitude towards the controversies reflects fears, hopes and expectations and legitimate concerns about important political and social goals. Using SSMs focus on relations and attitudes, we can document how controversies attributed to new technology is not a question of technology but of perceived political interference.}

Its motivation lies in the increasing global political, social, academic as well as practical importance of managing and reporting on carbon-related issues. Methodologically, we employ a systematic literature review. Thus, we identify 73 quantitative peer-reviewed empirical studies in this field and categorize them according to a legitimacy-theory-based framework. Our four main contributions offer new insights into this emerging research field and provide guidance for the development of new research models: First, we help future researchers to structure this emerging field of research with respect to the interactions of the phenomenon itself (carbon performance vs. disclosure), its determinants (country- and firm-related governance), and its financial consequences (value relevance, information asymmetry, financial performance, and cost of capital). Second, we provide a comprehensive overview of variables and proxies used in the studies and list their main statistical effects, which facilitates building novel models. There are indications that 1) board composition positively influences both carbon performance and disclosure, 2) carbon performance and carbon disclosure are positively connected, 3) carbon disclosure reduces information asymmetry, and 4) carbon performance increases financial performance. Third, we develop a research agenda with concise suggestions for future studies. Fourth, we argue that due to the under-theorization of concepts the comparability of included studies is challenging, this research field may be characterized as a vibrant field for extensive future research.}

We find that the ecosystem, which comprises actors who hold resources and interact to coevolve, could be leveraged to facilitate a BM launch in manners beyond relying on activity-sharing synergies across BMs. Specifically, three configurations, each of which consists of a BM launch challenge, an ecosystem facet (i.e., Learning Club, Home Court, or Magnetic Field), and a leveraging strategy (i.e., Knowledge Orchestrator, Capability Bundler, or Service Aggregator), are identified to depict the associated process. Our findings offer a dynamic understanding of BM portfolio extension by integrating the actor-orientation of ecosystem and the activity-based view of BM. We also contribute to ecosystem literature by shedding light on a corporate ecosystem, revealing its generative properties, and linking its role to corporate strategy literature.}

However, the tiny size of the eyes makes sampling difficult and invasive studies costly and ethically constrained. Developing ocular formulations following conventional trial-and-error formulation and manufacturing process screening procedures is inefficient. Along with the popularity of computational pharmaceutics, non-invasive in silico modeling & simulation offer new opportunities for the paradigm shift of ocular formulation development. The current work first systematically reviews the theoretical underpinnings, advanced applications, and unique advantages of data-driven machine learning and multiscale simulation approaches represented by molecular simulation, mathematical modeling, and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling for ocular drug development. Following this, a new computer-driven framework for rational pharmaceutical formulation design is proposed, inspired by the potential of in silico explorations in understanding drug delivery details and facilitating drug formulation design. Lastly, to promote the paradigm shift, integrated in silico methodologies were highlighted, and discussions on data challenges, model practicality, personalized modeling, regulatory science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and talent training were conducted in detail with a view to achieving more efficient objective-oriented pharmaceutical formulation design.}

The spatial planning, development, and management of lifetime neighbourhoods with embedded ambient intelligence as a risk mitigation strategy in fast ageing cities are of specific interest. We wish to evaluate how the development of lifetime neighbourhoods mitigates the risk of accidents and social exclusion, thereby creating value for the community. The creation of value by the mitigation of the risk of falls, diseases, and social exclusion will be measured with the actuarial present value generated using the multiple decrement model approach, which is a novelty. The actuarial present value will provide scientific evidence of the benefits of the development and management of various lifetime neighbourhoods and housing arrangements.}

Nevertheless, transitioning from the “electronic” to the stage of “transformational” domain – coined as t-Government – is posing the greatest challenge of how government services respond to changes in the broader economy and society. Despite considerable investments and the wide use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), research literature on e-Government suggests that government services have yet to reach the full potential of seamless integration, where all transactions are completed electronically. Through a detailed analysis of the extant e-Government literature and a case study based empirical research, this paper explores the domain of e-Government in identifying the possible reasons for this potential shortfall in achieving full integration. Furthermore, the paper intends to highlight an aspect of complexity surrounding crossing the integration gap as the authors denote by “eChasm” in the e-Government conceptual model that leads to transformation. In addition, it focuses on radical change through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and the call for strategic style of leadership, for cross-agency collaboration leading to a successful realisation of transformational government (t-Government). It is interesting to note that researchers and public sector leaders have started to realise that implementing and managing the transformation of public services, copiously satisfying the users and stakeholders, is a task of multi-dimensional complexity.}

Electronic health records (EHRs) are transforming and revolutionizing the healthcare industry. However, whereas developed countries have a high EHR penetration rate, adoption of EHRs in developing countries is lagging behind. Recently, the Korean and Russian governments have been pursuing economic cooperation in the Russian Far East. Thus, since 2009, Russia’s EHR market and healthcare system have been maturing in tandem.
Objective
To qualitatively investigate and analyze the current status of EHRs in the Russian Far East and derive implementation plans for nationwide EHRs.
Methods
A qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and administrative officers in the Russian Far East was conducted to illuminate the current status of EHRs and to collect various perspectives on barriers and facilitators to implementation.
Results
The analysis revealed six major barriers and five major facilitators for implementation of nationwide EHRs in the Russian Far East. The barriers include lack of communications, an insufficient system development environment, poor adoption of standard terminology, poor infrastructure, resistance to a new system, and poor functionality. Facilitators include strategic government planning, centrally managed systems, health information exchange, willingness to use new functions, and well-established work processes.
Conclusions
This study’s results, along with the experiences of developed countries that have already successfully introduced EHRs, will help support successful introduction of EHRs in the Russian Far East.}

However, existing research on CRBCs primarily focuses on outcome-based sustainability analysis, neglecting production-based evaluation. To bridge this gap, our study investigates sustainability of CRBC using the inclusive wealth index (IWI), IWI per capita, and IWI density. We find substantial variations in CRBCs' inclusive wealth influenced by regional distribution and life stages. Regionally, sustainable development capacity follows the sequence “east > west > central > northeast”, with the northern region benefiting from abundant non-renewable natural capital. In terms of life stage sustainable development, the sequence is “growing > regenerative > grown-up > recessionary”. The decline in wealth performance from growing to recessionary types confirms the negative impact of the “resource curse” phenomenon, where resource dependence hampers growth. However, the regenerative type demonstrates the potential for transformation through sustainable development strategies. Our study presents practical strategies to enhance regional policies by adopting the IWI accounting indicator system proposed by the United Nations Environment Programme and localizing it to align with the characteristics of CRBCs in China. This innovative approach facilitates the evaluation of CRBCs' sustainable development performance.}

On the basis of this type of platform, numerous “collaborative entrepreneurship” initiatives have emerged in recent years, which have established themselves in cities, competing with services that already existed but providing them with greater flexibility and incurring in lower costs. Currently, most companies tend to outsource productive resources, taking advantage of the virtualization capacity of their jobs, thanks to the extensive coverage of connectivity networks deployed in cities. This situation facilitates the entry of new agents that can solve this growing demand into the market. In this chapter, we analyze the different business platforms capable of implementing compatible self-employment activities, to facilitate labor insertion through sustainable and quality self-employment that responds to the demand for services in cities.}

abstract = {Data accountability (i.e., data integrity and traceability) concerns existing construction cost management platforms due to the risk of data manipulation in a centralized paradigm. Blockchain is a promising technology that provides immutable and traceable data storage with a decentralized architecture. However, the transparency of blockchain conflicts with the confidentiality nature of cost information. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework based on blockchain and encryption to preserve both data accountability and confidentiality in construction cost management. The proposed new framework involves the development of a cost data model containing the required confidential cost information to facilitate partially transparent recordings on the blockchain. An access control model based on symmetric and asymmetric encryption as well as proxy re-encryption mechanisms is developed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive cost data on the blockchain and transfer data access in dynamic construction projects (i.e., construction projects involving new members continuously). Subsequently, encryption-integrated smart contracts are developed for automatic and secure cost activities on the blockchain. The framework is validated with a desirable latency (at the millisecond level), throughput (at the hundred level), and storage cost (at the MB level) in three illustrative cost management scenarios. The results indicate that project members can have accountable and confidential cost data for dispute resolution and cost analysis, respectively, as well as efficient cost data access transfer.}

Although similar in physical appearance to pedestrians, e-scooter riders follow distinctly different characteristics of movement and can reach speeds of up to 45 kmph. The challenge of detecting e-scooter riders is exacerbated in urban environments where the frequency of partial occlusion is increased as riders navigate between vehicles, traffic infrastructure and other road users. This can lead to the non-detection or mis-classification of e-scooter riders as pedestrians, providing inaccurate information for accident mitigation and path planning in autonomous vehicle applications. This research introduces a novel benchmark for partially occluded e-scooter rider detection to facilitate the objective characterization of detection models. A novel, occlusion-aware method of e-scooter rider detection is presented that achieves a 15.93% improvement in detection performance over the current state of the art.}

abstract = {Introduction
Dementia is characterized by global cognitive dysfunction, which can cause difficulties in performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), leaving people with dementia (PwD) who do not have the proper support extremely vulnerable. Dementia management should involve preventative methods, including during the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Lay-caregivers are found to have poorer health in all three domains of the biopsychosocial model, as a result of the burden of care. New assistive technologies (ATs) have been designed to help care for PwD. ATs aim to be more affordable and widely available than human workers, achieving greater health equity and quality of life for all.
Methods
To identify relevant articles, a literature search using PubMed was undertaken by one independent reviewer: S.L.C. The keywords of “dementia”, “technology”, and “management” were used, with no date of publication limitations, which revealed 571 results.
Results
44 articles were included in this review. Articles regarding new technologies to diagnose dementia or MCI were not included. ATs aim to help facilitate aging-in-place, reduce medical costs, and rates of caregiver burnout, by helping maintain patient functioning.
Discussion
Legal issues in the form of workplace safety laws, data privacy laws and regulations, and health care ethics are major barriers to implementation that need to be resolved. The hope is that artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be able to advance what they are able to perceive and help uncover new knowledge and management options for dementia and MCI.}

abstract = {This article discusses a number of key issues concerning simulation-based digital twins in the domain of multistage processes. Almost all production processes are multistage in nature, and so most digital twins involve multiple physical phenomena, process steps and different solvers for the simulations. Good interoperability between model solvers and processes are key to achieving a functional digital twin. Passing information between steps can be challenging, complex and time consuming, especially for material data, because the constitutive model interacts with the full modeling environment: material behavior is interdependent with the history of the process, the solver subroutines and the boundary conditions. This work proposes a flexible yet robust standardization approach, called FlexMM, for dealing with material data, constitutive models, measurement data or mathematical models to overcome part of the abovementioned complexity. The implementation of FlexMM consists of a general rule structure in which constitutive behavior is described, as well as its interaction with the subroutines used by the finite element solver. The definition of the constitutive model is stored in a separate file, in which the material behavior can be described in a user selected format, such as look-up tables, standard statistical models, machine learning or analytical expressions. After a calculation step, the new local material properties are mapped to a file to facilitate the next history-dependent step. In this way, the interaction between the different fabrication steps and processes can be incorporated. A material/process case study is presented to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of FlexMM.}

An e-health two-sided market needs to offer sustainable structures, i.e., an ecosystem to support a flexible model that must meet unexpected demand and at the same time be able to handle high demand peaks and long periods if needed. In this chapter we introduce key concepts and factors that are of relevance in two-sided markets. We further discuss the fundamental role of two-side market ecosystem in enabling parties to realize gains from trade or other interactions by reducing the transactions costs of finding each other and interacting. Hence, e-health market ecosystems first and foremost need to be designed for adaptability and network effects. We discuss issues that influence the sustainability and further development of a two-sided e-health market.}

In this interdisciplinary study, we capture empirical evidence of not only what healthcare work could be automated using current technology, but also what should be automated. We investigate these research questions by utilizing probabilistic machine learning models trained on thousands of expert ratings, provided by both healthcare practitioners and automation experts. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze the desirability of automating healthcare work activities (human workforce preferences) in combination with current technological capabilities. We present a succinct four quadrant model, the Automatability-Desirability Matrix, based on our findings. It can be used to support policymakers and organizational leaders in developing practical strategies on how to harness the positive power of AI, while accompanying change and empowering stakeholders in a participatory fashion. Furthermore, we observe that healthcare professionals desire a surprisingly high proportion of their work activities to be fully automated, while being less optimistic about the current automation potential of healthcare work than technical experts. Our results represent the first detailed quantitative empirical evidence of healthcare practitioners’ preferences regarding the automation of work and the first direct comparison of the potential for automation as based on the perspectives of technical experts and those working as healthcare practitioners.}

abstract = {For many years, transatlantic cooperation between the EU and the US in the area of personal data exchange has been a subject of special interest on the part of lawmakers, courts – including supranational ones – NGOs and the public. When implementing recent reform of data protection law, the European Union decided to further strengthen guarantees of the protection of privacy in cyberspace. At the same time, however, it faced the practical problem of how to ensure compliance with these principles in relation to third countries. The approach proposed in the GDPR, which is based on a newly-defined territorial scope of application, clearly indicates an attempt to apply EU rules extraterritorially in relation to data processors in third countries. Irrespective of EU activity, the United States has also introduced its own regulations addressing the same problem. An example is the federal law adopted in 2018, specifying how to execute national court orders for the transfer of electronic data. The CLOUD Act was established in response to legal doubts raised in the Microsoft v United States case regarding the transfer of electronic data stored in the cloud by US obliged entities to law enforcement authorities, as well as in cases where this data is physically located in another country and its transfer could result in violating the legal norms of a foreign jurisdiction. The CLOUD Act also facilitates bilateral international agreements that enable the cross-border transfer of e-evidence for the purposes of ongoing criminal proceedings. Both the content of the new regulations and the model proposed by the US legislature for future agreements concluded on the basis of the CLOUD Act can be seen as an alternative to regulations arising from EU law. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the CLOUD Act and CLOUD Act Agreements from the perspective of EU law and, in particular, attempt to answer the question as to whether this new legal mechanism brings the EU and the USA closer to finding common ground with regard to a coherent model of exchange and protection of personal data.}

Our approach consolidates and extends the previously mentioned approaches through a careful analysis that results in eleven strategic lenses—which can help managers more robustly assess the strengths and weaknesses of potential business model ideas. We provide specific questions that will aid teams in rating the degree to which each strategic lens is fulfilled by their business model ideas. Further, we present three different process methodologies to match the time investment and analysis robustness desired by specific organizations.

abstract = {Background
Reducing waste, improving quality, boosting treatment efficacy, and providing safe patient-centered health care are the top priorities for most healthcare organizations. A reliable incident reporting system is a method that can help decision-makers stay aware of any incidents that violate patient safety guidelines, examine the probable causes, and come up with new policies that can prevent future patient safety violations.
Methods
In this study, we present our newly developed electronic Occurrence Variance Reporting system (eOVR), made specifically for low-income countries with a cost as low as 5 USD/month, along with the steps required for the reporting and the potential benefits to the whole healthcare system. This system was developed using a third-party application, AppSheet, which provides already established customizable forms that would help any hospital to develop its reporting system without the need for programming experts or the expensive infrastructure needed for it.
Results
Our system is composed of three main stages that allow the participating members to report, taking a decision, and evaluating the need for further actions. We implemented a mixture of electronic tools designed to fulfill the purpose of reporting incidents and facilitating the analysis of the system gaps, especially in times of crisis using an incident report that can be generated automatically and immediately using this system.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first electronic model of OVR developed to be used in individual hospitals in low-income countries without the need for expensive infrastructure or hiring a professional programmer. This model could save time and offer more flexibility and versatility to both the incident reporter and the decision-makers. Lastly, offering a low-cost solution, as low as 5 USD/month, would encourage the hospitals to participate in incident reporting, as well as enhance the digitalization process in low-income countries.}

Motivated by continuing sub-optimal health and safety management processes, the research employs a conceptual framework rooted in construction guidance: structuring data via a 7-stage ontology to improve designer knowledge of issues and give access to an expanding safety knowledge base (the BIM Safety Risk Library). The tool facilitates tacit and explicit knowledge sharing in visual environments, enabling the construction industry to benefit from their health and safety data while providing an interactive learning tool for designers.

Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with a range of stakeholders involved in the asset lifecycle, experts in BIM or in sustainable approaches, to understand the obstacles to the holistic consideration of the asset lifecycle in the CE context. A descriptive interpretative analysis was used for the interviews' transcripts to identify common themes and sub-themes. A pattern-matching method was used for seeking the similarities and differences between the twenty stakeholders’ views and the literature. The study shows thirty-four new barriers identified by the interviewees and not found in the literature. Recommendations are given for accelerating the asset lifecycle reconsideration and the CE embracement.}

abstract = {With data being generated at an unprecedented rate, monetizing data has become a paramount issue in this era of the digital economy. Firms have traditionally leveraged consumer data to improve their product or service offerings and increase their sales revenue, which is indirect data monetization. The recent emergence of online data markets and the data brokerage industry have facilitated direct data monetization, enabling firms to obtain additional revenue by selling their anonymized data directly to data brokers. This study develops a game-theoretic model to investigate the impact of direct data monetization on competition between firms. Our results show that in equilibrium, high-value firms with competitive advantages in product or service value often sell less data than low-value firms, implying that high-value firms rely less on direct data monetization than low-value firms. Surprisingly, as direct data monetization prevails, high-value firms further dominate the market for selling products or services, especially when the data broker's analytics capability is high. This result reveals that data brokers with high analytics capabilities can hinder, rather than facilitate, market competition. Finally, direct data monetization may benefit both consumer surplus and social welfare because it facilitates data-sharing between firms, allowing firms to obtain additional insights to improve their product or service offerings. These findings are explored in-depth, along with different model extensions and their relevant managerial implications.}

Further understanding and guidelines for firms are needed. Design thinking is a promising problem solving approach capable of facilitating the innovation process. However, design thinking does not necessarily include sustainability considerations, and it has not been sufficiently explored for application in business model innovation. Given the additional challenges posed by the need for time-efficiency and a digital environment, we have therefore developed a design thinking-based framework to guide the early development of circular business models in an online and efficient manner. We propose a new process framework called the Circular Sprint. This encompasses seven phases and contains twelve purposefully adapted activities. The framework development follows an Action Design Research approach, iteratively combining four streams of literature, feedback from sixteen experts and six workshops, and involved a total of 107 participants working in fourteen teams. The present paper describes the framework and its activities, together with evaluations of its usefulness and ease-of-use. The research shows that, while challenging, embedding sustainability, circularity and business model innovation within a design thinking process is indeed possible. We offer a flexible framework and a set of context-adaptable activities that can support innovators and practitioners in the complex process of circular business model innovation. These tools can also be used for training and educational purposes. We invite future researchers to build upon and modify our framework and its activities by adapting it to their required scenarios and purposes.

abstract = {Healthcare 3D printing (3DP) is in nascent stage and some service providers are facilitating its adoption across hospitals in the world. There is limited research on healthcare 3DP services, the business models of such service providers, the value they provide to the surgeons and the hospitals and the co-creation process needed to deliver such service innovation. The objective of this research is to identify the value proposition, value creation, value capture and value provided to users by the healthcare 3DP service providers and to identify the resources and capabilities needed by the healthcare 3DP service providers and the clinical team to co-create value. Interviews are conducted with seven healthcare 3DP service providers, three surgeons, and a healthcare 3DP design expert along with secondary data collected from the service providers to answer the research questions. The results show that healthcare 3DP service providers utilise their exploitative capabilities while the surgeons used both explorative and exploitative capabilities to engage in the co-creation process and to create perceived value for patients. The findings also show that integrated healthcare 3DP service providers by providing knowledge, expertise, insights and training to the surgical teams are better suited to improve the absorptive capacity of hospitals to adopt 3D Printing than specialised implant developers.}

Paper is an excellent natural substrate for emerging low-cost, ecologically acceptable analytical devices. Flexibility, three-dimensional fibre structure, mechanical characteristics, ease of manufacturing and customization are the key advantages of cellulose as preferable materials for green analytical devices. This article overviews the advances in paper-based optical and electroanalytical devices, including manufacturing, validation of functions, detection methodology, and applications. The renewable resources hold the potential to accomplish the biodegradable analytical techniques due to their climate neutral waste management. The paper-based electrodes have demonstrated excellent performance for diagnostics while being eco-friendly at the same time. Therefore, the forthcoming sustainable diagnostics approaches require integrating paper-based analytical devices (PADs) built out of disposable electrodes. The diverse green materials and methods facilitate climate neural point-of-care products for the net-zero market. Numerous researches have been conducted in recent years to develop innovative technologies capable of analysing clinical samples quickly, accurately, simply, and sensitively, with the primary objective of offering competent tools for illness diagnosis and treatment efficacy follow-up. The micro-PADs show excellent abilities for quick onsite diagnostics within μ-level detection range. The sensitivity, stability, and reliability of analytical devices are the essential factors enabling larger-scale production and commercialization. The projected fabrication and analytical methods in the direction of paper-based devices could be nicely and reliably utilized for understanding and adaptation of climate neutral diagnostic technologies in healthcare sector. This detailed article discusses the sustainable framework that integrates green bioelectronics and sensor technologies adhering to diverse functionality for health and the environment. The paper-based digital technology (PDigiT) could be employed as a simple, cost-effective, and efficient net-zero technology for real-time monitoring of outbreaks and bio-surveillance.}

In this paper we argue that developers can benefit from IoT frameworks by reusing their components so as to build in less time and effort IoT systems that can easily integrate new technologies. In order to explore the reuse opportunities offered by IoT frameworks we have performed a case study and analyzed 503 components reused by 35 IoT projects. We examined (a) the types of functionality that are most facilitated for reuse (b) the reuse strategy that is most adopted (c) thequality of the reused components. The results of the case study suggest that the main functionality reused is the one related to the Device Management layer and that Black-box reuse is the main type. Moreover, the quality of the reused components is improved compared to the rest of the components built from scratch.}

Optimizing the words, sentences and alphanumeric characters of a script is the purpose of research, without losing intelligibility, semantics, perception, content flow and the contextual scenarios, represented as dimensions. We interpret the manuscript as a document ecosystem, within which different dimensions are construed. We choose different lexes, sentences, paragraphs and pages that possess frequent alphanumeric characters, interpreted in multiple domains and contexts. The ontologies of alphanumeric textual-data dimensions and their metaphors are presented in several data schemas, connecting various contexts of document ecosystems. The domain ontologies that can deliver text-mining, the semantic and schematic information of textual data, can expedite the textual-data integration process in the multidimensional warehouse modelling procedure. Diverse views and contexts that are generic within the document ecosystems are analysed for contextual knowledge. The ontologically structured document ecosystems that can facilitate more legibility and reproducibility to a variety of document designers are research outcomes.

This is particularly true in the case of medical imaging, a field in which digital revolution is facilitating better interpretation and comparison of medical images, paving the way for the implementation of AI applications. AI applications and machine learning approaches rely heavily on data used to fuel them, both in terms of quantity and quality. However, this data usually comes from multiple sources and sites, which raises issues about its integrity and reliability as well as security (particularly since we are dealing with medical data). These issues can be addressed by incorporating blockchain technology into the AI systems implemented in the healthcare environment. In this review, we will consider what blockchain technology has to offer in terms of handling patients’ medical data and how this can help overcome some of the challenges faced by AI applications in healthcare. We will center our attention on the field of medical imaging, particularly in relation to capsule endoscopy, where there has been considerable effort to develop AI applications that aid diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making.}

The pressure for increased product customization is often high and, therefore, manufacturing companies and networks cannot cope with the additional complexity. Many manufacturing companies are still challenged into taking full advantage of product data and lifecycle management systems. This chapter delves into how modern digital manufacturing technologies with advanced product information and lifecycle management platforms may be utilized for reducing and eventually taming the complexity in production systems and networks. Furthermore, the key challenges for employing digital technologies under the Industry 4.0 framework are discussed.

Applying multilevel modeling on a sample of more than 6000 entrepreneurs from 62 countries the study offers empirical support for these predictions. The findings are robust to alternative specifications. Entrepreneurs using the internet to sell their products and services are more likely to focus on customers in foreign markets when they face institutional voids and a lack of digital infrastructure in their home countries. The study contributes as follows: From a theoretical view, it provides a better understanding of the boundary conditions of the digitalization-new venture internationalization linkage. From a practical perspective, the findings of the study suggest the complementary roles of institutional voids and digital infrastructure at home to help entrepreneurs grow domestically and facilitate their internationalization.}

In high-impact applications, inference on risk and uncertainty will become decisive in the adoption of AI/ML systems. To this end, there is a pressing need for a consolidated understanding on the varied risks arising from AI/ML systems, and how these risks and their side effects emerge and unfold in practice. In this paper, we provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of a broad array of inherent risks that can arise in AI/ML systems. These risks are grouped into two categories: data-level risk (e.g., data bias, dataset shift, out-of-domain data, and adversarial attacks) and model-level risk (e.g., model bias, misspecification, and uncertainty). In addition, we highlight the research needs for developing a holistic framework for risk management dedicated to AI/ML systems to hedge the corresponding risks. Furthermore, we outline several research related challenges and opportunities along with the development of risk-aware AI/ML systems. Our research has the potential to significantly increase the credibility of deploying AI/ML models in high-stakes decision settings for facilitating safety assurance, and preventing systems from unintended consequences.}

Additionally, works in this direction still lack a well established systemic foundation. Thus, handling properly the social factor in Human-CPS interaction remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a new perspective and a formalisation for the CPSS paradigm, which is grounded on the theory of systems. The aim of this is to provide a general framework to handle social dimensions in Human-CPS interactions. We propose a meta-model, which provides a conceptual ground to design CPSS spaces where CPS are enhanced with social capabilities.}

Following the digitization trend that characterized the last decades, manufacturers integrate Information and communications technologies in their approaches that support their progression towards this new era. New solutions that facilitate the integration of customers in the product design and manufacturing, integrating unique regional requirements become part of the standard design procedure followed by modern manufacturing. The wide infiltration of mobile devices in end- users’ life creates an open stream of valuable data that may affect product design and drive the design of manufacturing networks. To support this process, it is important to classify the novel integrations that act on different parts of the lifecycle using state of the art Industry 4.0 architectures, facilitating manufacturers to keep track on how its development may affect their production. This paper presents how a set of tools designed to integrate customers in the product design and manufacturing that consider Industry 4.0 technologies may be classified using the RAMI 4.0 architecture. The tools affect different parts of the product’s lifecycle, connecting the end-user with the product design and manufacturing network design and RAMI 4.0 was selected to model the information flow between the different levels that provide increased sustainability that benefits both the manufacturer and the customers. Classifying the tools using standardized models aims to support their integration in future developments that consider Internet of Things. The aforementioned tools are applied in a refrigerator production use case provided by a large white goods manufacturer.}

abstract = {Since the success of Bitcoin, there have been increased focus of studying the application of blockchain in a broad range of applications, such as in solutions facilitating identity privacy and transaction security using a decentralized architecture via different consensus mechanisms (e.g. proof-of-work) between different geo-located IoT devices/nodes in our increasingly digitalized society (e.g. smart city). In this paper, we survey the usage of blockchain technology for smart communities, focusing on key components of the blockchain applications. We also study the various process models used in the execution of secure transactions. Specifically, we present a detailed taxonomy on the applications, process models used, and communication infrastructure support needed to execute various applications.}
